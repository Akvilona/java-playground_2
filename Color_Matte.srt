1
00:00:02,720 --> 00:00:03,440
Pride and

2
00:00:03,440 --> 00:00:04,740
Prejudice by

3
00:00:04,740 --> 00:00:05,940
Jane Austen.

4
00:00:06,420 --> 00:00:07,620
Chapter one.

5
00:00:09,140 --> 00:00:10,020
It is a truth

6
00:00:10,020 --> 00:00:10,700
universally.

7
00:00:10,700 --> 00:00:11,580
Acknowledged

8
00:00:11,580 --> 00:00:12,660
that a single man

9
00:00:12,660 --> 00:00:13,380
in possession of a.

10
00:00:13,380 --> 00:00:14,300
Good fortune

11
00:00:14,300 --> 00:00:15,480
must be in want.

12
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:16,680
Of a wife.

13
00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:18,000
However little known

14
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:18,540
the feelings

15
00:00:18,540 --> 00:00:19,380
or views of such

16
00:00:19,380 --> 00:00:20,120
a man may be

17
00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:21,140
on his first entering

18
00:00:21,140 --> 00:00:22,160
a neighborhood.

19
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:23,040
This truth is.

20
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:23,660
So well

21
00:00:23,660 --> 00:00:24,680
fixed in the minds

22
00:00:24,680 --> 00:00:24,840
of the

23
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:26,040
surrounding families

24
00:00:26,220 --> 00:00:26,640
that he is

25
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:27,080
considered

26
00:00:27,080 --> 00:00:28,100
the rightful property

27
00:00:28,100 --> 00:00:28,740
of some one

28
00:00:28,740 --> 00:00:29,480
or other of their.

29
00:00:29,480 --> 00:00:30,680
Daughters.

30
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:32,460
My dear Mr.

31
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:33,440
Bennett.

32
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:34,580
Said his lady to him

33
00:00:34,580 --> 00:00:35,640
one day.

34
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:36,660
Have you heard that

35
00:00:36,660 --> 00:00:37,680
Netherfield Park

36
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:38,880
is let it last?

37
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:39,900
Mr.

38
00:00:39,900 --> 00:00:40,860
Bennett replied

39
00:00:40,860 --> 00:00:42,060
that he had not.

40
00:00:42,380 --> 00:00:44,160
But it is returned.

41
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:45,540
She, for Mrs.

42
00:00:45,540 --> 00:00:45,860
long,

43
00:00:45,860 --> 00:00:47,060
has just been here.

44
00:00:47,060 --> 00:00:48,240
And she told me

45
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:49,440
all about it.

46
00:00:50,120 --> 00:00:50,480
Mr.

47
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:51,720
Bennett made no answer.

48
00:00:52,460 --> 00:00:53,420
Do you not want to know

49
00:00:53,420 --> 00:00:54,620
who has taken it?

50
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:55,260
Cried his

51
00:00:55,260 --> 00:00:56,240
wife impatiently.

52
00:00:58,080 --> 00:00:59,040
You want to tell me?

53
00:00:59,040 --> 00:00:59,300
And I

54
00:00:59,300 --> 00:01:00,080
have no objection

55
00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:01,280
to hearing it.

56
00:01:01,980 --> 00:01:03,360
This was invitation

57
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:04,560
enough.

58
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:05,700
Why, my dear.

59
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:07,200
You must know Mrs.

60
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:07,920
Long says that.

61
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:09,080
Netherfield is taken by.

62
00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:09,720
A young man

63
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:10,820
of large fortune

64
00:01:10,820 --> 00:01:11,280
from the north

65
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:12,240
of England.

66
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:13,020
That he came down

67
00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:14,000
on Monday in Natchez,

68
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,200
and for to see the place

69
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:16,500
and was so much

70
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:17,600
delighted with it

71
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:18,680
that he agreed with Mr.

72
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:19,880
Morris immediately

73
00:01:19,940 --> 00:01:20,480
that he is to

74
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:21,120
take possession

75
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:22,080
before Michaelmas

76
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:23,300
and some of his servants

77
00:01:23,300 --> 00:01:23,520
ought to.

78
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:24,140
Be in the house

79
00:01:24,140 --> 00:01:24,600
by the end of.

80
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:25,800
Next week.

81
00:01:26,420 --> 00:01:27,620
What is his name?

82
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:29,600
Bingley.

83
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:31,140
Is he married

84
00:01:31,140 --> 00:01:32,340
or single?

85
00:01:32,460 --> 00:01:33,360
Oh, single,

86
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:34,760
my dear, to be sure.

87
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,060
A single man

88
00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:37,320
of large Fortune

89
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:39,740
four or 5000 a year.

90
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:41,540
What a fine

91
00:01:41,540 --> 00:01:42,960
thing for our girls.

92
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:45,080
How so?

93
00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:46,280
How can it affect them?

94
00:01:46,860 --> 00:01:48,180
My dear Mr.

95
00:01:48,180 --> 00:01:49,160
Bennett.

96
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:50,360
Replied his wife.

97
00:01:50,540 --> 00:01:51,360
How can you

98
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:52,560
be so tiresome?

99
00:01:52,700 --> 00:01:53,880
You must know

100
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:54,780
that I am thinking

101
00:01:54,780 --> 00:01:55,820
of his marrying

102
00:01:55,820 --> 00:01:57,020
one of them.

103
00:01:57,800 --> 00:01:58,880
Is that his design

104
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:00,080
in settling here?

105
00:02:00,660 --> 00:02:01,860
Design.

106
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,120
Nonsense.

107
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:04,020
How can you talk?

108
00:02:04,020 --> 00:02:05,120
So.

109
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:06,360
But it is very likely

110
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:07,440
that he may fall in love

111
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:08,340
with one of them.

112
00:02:08,340 --> 00:02:09,260
And therefore,

113
00:02:09,260 --> 00:02:10,380
you must visit him

114
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:11,580
as soon as he comes.

115
00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:13,120
I see no occasion

116
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:13,940
for that.

117
00:02:13,940 --> 00:02:15,360
You and the girls may go

118
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:15,800
or you may

119
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:17,160
send them by themselves,

120
00:02:17,180 --> 00:02:17,840
which perhaps

121
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:19,040
will be still better

122
00:02:19,340 --> 00:02:20,000
for as you are

123
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:20,540
as handsome

124
00:02:20,540 --> 00:02:21,680
as any of them.

125
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:22,020
Mr.

126
00:02:22,020 --> 00:02:22,880
Bingley might like you

127
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:24,080
the best of the party.

128
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:26,660
My dear,

129
00:02:26,660 --> 00:02:27,900
you've flatter me.

130
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:29,580
I certainly have

131
00:02:29,580 --> 00:02:30,780
had my share of beauty.

132
00:02:30,980 --> 00:02:32,160
But I do not pretend

133
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:32,700
to be anything

134
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:33,900
extraordinary now.

135
00:02:34,220 --> 00:02:35,660
When a woman has five

136
00:02:35,660 --> 00:02:36,800
grown up daughters,

137
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:37,560
she ought to give

138
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:38,180
over thinking

139
00:02:38,180 --> 00:02:39,380
of her own beauty.

140
00:02:39,780 --> 00:02:40,800
In such cases, a

141
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:41,760
woman has not often

142
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:43,040
much beauty to think of.

143
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:45,320
But, my

144
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:46,520
dear, you must

145
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:47,940
indeed go and see Mr.

146
00:02:47,940 --> 00:02:48,300
Bingley

147
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:48,980
when he comes into

148
00:02:48,980 --> 00:02:50,180
the neighborhood.

149
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:51,140
It is more than

150
00:02:51,140 --> 00:02:52,040
I engaged for,

151
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:53,240
I assure you.

152
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:54,180
But consider

153
00:02:54,180 --> 00:02:55,380
your daughters

154
00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:56,780
only think

155
00:02:56,780 --> 00:02:58,260
what an establishment

156
00:02:58,260 --> 00:02:58,740
it would be for

157
00:02:58,740 --> 00:02:59,700
one of them.

158
00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:00,860
So William and Lady

159
00:03:00,860 --> 00:03:02,180
Lucas are determined

160
00:03:02,180 --> 00:03:02,900
to go

161
00:03:02,900 --> 00:03:04,260
merely on that account.

162
00:03:04,460 --> 00:03:05,180
For in general,

163
00:03:05,180 --> 00:03:05,880
you know, they visit

164
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:07,080
no new comers.

165
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:08,520
Indeed, you must go.

166
00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:08,960
For it

167
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:09,720
will be impossible

168
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:10,700
for us to visit him

169
00:03:10,700 --> 00:03:11,900
if you do not.

170
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:12,660
You are over

171
00:03:12,660 --> 00:03:13,860
scrupulous, surely.

172
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:15,060
I daresay Mr.

173
00:03:15,060 --> 00:03:15,600
Bingley will be

174
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:16,800
very glad to see you.

175
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:17,580
And I will send

176
00:03:17,580 --> 00:03:18,600
a few lines by you

177
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:19,220
to assure him

178
00:03:19,220 --> 00:03:20,420
of my hearty consent

179
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:21,440
to his marrying

180
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:21,840
whichever

181
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:23,180
he chooses of the girls.

182
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:24,560
Though

183
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:25,160
I must throw

184
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:25,820
in a good word

185
00:03:25,820 --> 00:03:27,020
for my little Lizzie.

186
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:28,280
I desire,

187
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:28,640
You will do

188
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:29,840
no such thing.

189
00:03:29,900 --> 00:03:31,260
Lizzie is not a bit

190
00:03:31,260 --> 00:03:32,420
better than the others,

191
00:03:32,420 --> 00:03:33,020
and I am sure

192
00:03:33,020 --> 00:03:33,780
she is not half

193
00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:34,980
so handsome as Jane.

194
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:35,780
Nor half so good

195
00:03:35,780 --> 00:03:36,980
humored as Lydia.

196
00:03:37,140 --> 00:03:37,920
But you are

197
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:39,020
always giving her

198
00:03:39,020 --> 00:03:40,220
the preference.

199
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:40,620
They have

200
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:41,820
none of them, much

201
00:03:41,820 --> 00:03:43,020
to recommend them.

202
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:44,140
Replied he.

203
00:03:44,140 --> 00:03:45,000
They're all silly

204
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:45,980
and ignorant

205
00:03:45,980 --> 00:03:46,880
like other girls.

206
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:48,420
But Lizzie has something

207
00:03:48,420 --> 00:03:49,380
more of quickness

208
00:03:49,380 --> 00:03:50,580
than her sisters.

209
00:03:50,780 --> 00:03:51,480
Mr.

210
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:52,460
Bennett,

211
00:03:52,460 --> 00:03:53,600
how can you abuse

212
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:54,320
your own children

213
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:55,520
in such a way?

214
00:03:55,620 --> 00:03:56,960
You take delight

215
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:58,160
in vexing me.

216
00:03:58,400 --> 00:03:59,840
You have no compassion

217
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:01,340
for my poor nerves.

218
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:03,420
You mistake me, my dear.

219
00:04:03,780 --> 00:04:04,800
I have a high respect

220
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:05,780
for your nerves.

221
00:04:05,780 --> 00:04:07,040
They are my old friends.

222
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:08,100
I have heard

223
00:04:08,100 --> 00:04:08,780
you mention them

224
00:04:08,780 --> 00:04:09,800
with consideration

225
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:11,300
these 20 years at least.

226
00:04:11,820 --> 00:04:12,660
No.

227
00:04:12,660 --> 00:04:13,700
You do not know

228
00:04:13,700 --> 00:04:14,900
what I suffer.

229
00:04:15,660 --> 00:04:16,380
But I hope

230
00:04:16,380 --> 00:04:17,580
you will get over it

231
00:04:17,660 --> 00:04:18,420
and live to see

232
00:04:18,420 --> 00:04:19,040
many young

233
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:20,440
men of 4000

234
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:20,940
a year

235
00:04:20,940 --> 00:04:21,480
come into

236
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:22,680
the neighborhood.

237
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:24,300
It would be no use to us

238
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:25,640
if 20 such would come,

239
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:27,080
since you will not visit

240
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:27,760
them.

241
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:29,240
Depend upon it, my dear,

242
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:31,220
that when there are 20,

243
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:33,000
I will visit them all.

244
00:04:34,700 --> 00:04:35,060
Mr.

245
00:04:35,060 --> 00:04:36,260
Bennett was so odd.

246
00:04:36,260 --> 00:04:36,920
A mixture of

247
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:37,860
quick parts,

248
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:39,080
sarcastic humor,

249
00:04:39,140 --> 00:04:40,560
reserve and caprice

250
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:42,060
that the experience

251
00:04:42,060 --> 00:04:43,340
of three and 20 years

252
00:04:43,340 --> 00:04:44,400
had been insufficient

253
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:44,760
to make

254
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:45,680
his wife understand

255
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:46,880
his character.

256
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:48,180
Her mind was less

257
00:04:48,180 --> 00:04:49,380
difficult to develop.

258
00:04:49,620 --> 00:04:50,480
She was a woman of

259
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:51,680
mean understanding.

260
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:53,000
Little information

261
00:04:53,060 --> 00:04:54,600
and uncertain temper.

262
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:55,560
When she

263
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:56,720
was discontented,

264
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:58,020
she fancied herself

265
00:04:58,020 --> 00:04:59,000
nervous.

266
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,240
The business of her life

267
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:00,800
was to get her

268
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:02,000
daughters married.

269
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,960
It's Solace was visiting

270
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:05,240
and news.

271
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:08,480
Chapter two.

272
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:10,080
Mr.

273
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:10,860
Bennett was among

274
00:05:10,860 --> 00:05:12,000
the earliest of those

275
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:12,840
who waited on Mr.

276
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:13,620
Bingley.

277
00:05:13,620 --> 00:05:14,780
He had always intended

278
00:05:14,780 --> 00:05:15,620
to visit him,

279
00:05:15,620 --> 00:05:16,520
though, to the last,

280
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:17,820
always assuring his wife

281
00:05:17,820 --> 00:05:19,020
that he should not go

282
00:05:19,100 --> 00:05:20,180
until the evening after

283
00:05:20,180 --> 00:05:21,200
the visit was paid.

284
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:22,140
She had no knowledge

285
00:05:22,140 --> 00:05:22,880
of it.

286
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:23,520
It was then.

287
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:24,360
Disclosed in

288
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:25,560
the following manner,

289
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:26,900
observing his second

290
00:05:26,900 --> 00:05:27,660
daughter employed

291
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:28,700
in trimming a hat,

292
00:05:28,700 --> 00:05:29,600
he suddenly addressed

293
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:30,020
her with.

294
00:05:30,980 --> 00:05:31,580
I hope Mr.

295
00:05:31,580 --> 00:05:32,120
Bingley will

296
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:33,320
like it, Lizzie.

297
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:35,400
We are not in a way

298
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:36,420
to know what Mr.

299
00:05:36,420 --> 00:05:37,500
Bingley likes.

300
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:37,880
Said her

301
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:39,080
mother resentfully.

302
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:39,680
Since we are

303
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:40,880
not to visit.

304
00:05:41,780 --> 00:05:42,660
But she forgets.

305
00:05:42,660 --> 00:05:44,160
Mamma said Elizabeth.

306
00:05:44,540 --> 00:05:45,440
That we shall meet him

307
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:46,640
at the assemblies

308
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:47,480
and that Mrs.

309
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:48,260
Long promised to

310
00:05:48,260 --> 00:05:49,460
introduce him.

311
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:50,940
I do not believe

312
00:05:50,940 --> 00:05:51,420
this is long

313
00:05:51,420 --> 00:05:52,700
will do any such thing.

314
00:05:52,980 --> 00:05:53,820
She has two

315
00:05:53,820 --> 00:05:55,020
nieces of her own.

316
00:05:55,220 --> 00:05:56,280
She is a selfish,

317
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:57,480
hypocritical woman.

318
00:05:57,500 --> 00:05:58,520
And I have no

319
00:05:58,520 --> 00:05:59,720
opinion of her.

320
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,200
No more have I?

321
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:01,880
Said Mr.

322
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:02,520
Bennett.

323
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:03,200
And I am glad

324
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:03,620
to find

325
00:06:03,620 --> 00:06:04,640
that you do not depend

326
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:05,840
on her serving you.

327
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:06,800
Mrs.

328
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:07,560
Bennett deigned

329
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:08,880
not to make any reply.

330
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:09,920
But unable

331
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:11,100
to contain herself,

332
00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:11,580
began.

333
00:06:11,580 --> 00:06:12,140
Scolding

334
00:06:12,140 --> 00:06:13,340
one of her daughters.

335
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:15,180
Don't keep coughing.

336
00:06:15,180 --> 00:06:16,140
So, Kitty,

337
00:06:16,140 --> 00:06:17,340
for heaven's sake,

338
00:06:17,540 --> 00:06:18,780
have a little compassion

339
00:06:18,780 --> 00:06:19,980
on my nerves.

340
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,660
You tear them to pieces.

341
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:23,400
Kitty has no

342
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:24,080
discretion in

343
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:25,040
her coughs.

344
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:26,240
Said her father.

345
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:27,480
She times them ill.

346
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:30,540
I do not cough

347
00:06:30,540 --> 00:06:31,860
for my own amusement.

348
00:06:32,180 --> 00:06:33,020
Replied Kitty,

349
00:06:33,020 --> 00:06:34,220
frightfully.

350
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:35,720
When is your next ball

351
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:36,920
to be, Lizzie?

352
00:06:37,340 --> 00:06:37,820
Tomorrow

353
00:06:37,820 --> 00:06:39,660
fortnight I.

354
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:41,000
So it is.

355
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:42,120
Cried her mother.

356
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:42,740
And Mrs.

357
00:06:42,740 --> 00:06:43,800
Long does not come back

358
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:45,000
to the day before.

359
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,080
So it will be impossible

360
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:46,440
for her

361
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:47,460
to introduce him.

362
00:06:47,460 --> 00:06:47,600
For

363
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:48,500
she will not know him

364
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:49,700
herself.

365
00:06:50,540 --> 00:06:51,120
Then, my dear,

366
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:51,480
you may

367
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:52,280
have the advantage

368
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:53,480
of your friend

369
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:54,840
and introduce Mr.

370
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:56,040
Bingley to her.

371
00:06:57,140 --> 00:06:58,340
Impossible, Mr.

372
00:06:58,340 --> 00:06:58,880
Bennett.

373
00:06:58,880 --> 00:06:59,960
Impossible.

374
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:01,080
When I am not acquainted

375
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:02,280
with him myself,

376
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:03,060
how can you be

377
00:07:03,060 --> 00:07:04,260
so teasing?

378
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:05,840
I honor

379
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:07,280
your circumspection.

380
00:07:07,580 --> 00:07:08,180
A fortnight's

381
00:07:08,180 --> 00:07:08,720
acquaintance

382
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:09,180
is certainly

383
00:07:09,180 --> 00:07:10,100
very little.

384
00:07:10,100 --> 00:07:10,860
One cannot know

385
00:07:10,860 --> 00:07:11,780
what a man really is

386
00:07:11,780 --> 00:07:12,380
by the end of

387
00:07:12,380 --> 00:07:13,580
a fortnight.

388
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:14,720
But if we do

389
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:15,500
not venture,

390
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:16,740
somebody else will.

391
00:07:16,940 --> 00:07:18,300
And after all, Mrs.

392
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:19,200
Long and her nieces

393
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:20,580
must stand their chance.

394
00:07:20,900 --> 00:07:21,620
And therefore,

395
00:07:21,620 --> 00:07:22,340
as she will think

396
00:07:22,340 --> 00:07:23,580
it, an act of kindness.

397
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:23,840
If you

398
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:25,040
decline the office,

399
00:07:25,140 --> 00:07:25,500
I will

400
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:26,700
take it on myself.

401
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:28,920
The girls

402
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:30,120
stared at their father.

403
00:07:30,380 --> 00:07:30,740
Mrs.

404
00:07:30,740 --> 00:07:31,940
Bennett said only

405
00:07:32,060 --> 00:07:33,180
nonsense.

406
00:07:33,180 --> 00:07:34,380
Nonsense.

407
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:36,720
What can be the meaning

408
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:37,040
of that

409
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:38,700
emphatic exclamation?

410
00:07:39,180 --> 00:07:40,340
Cried.

411
00:07:40,340 --> 00:07:41,220
Do you consider the

412
00:07:41,220 --> 00:07:42,420
forms of introduction

413
00:07:42,620 --> 00:07:43,700
and the stress that is

414
00:07:43,700 --> 00:07:44,160
laid on

415
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:45,360
them is nonsense.

416
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:46,620
I cannot quite agree

417
00:07:46,620 --> 00:07:47,820
with you there.

418
00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:49,100
What say you, Mary?

419
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:49,620
For?

420
00:07:49,620 --> 00:07:50,720
You are a young lady

421
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:51,680
of deep reflection.

422
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:52,040
I know.

423
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:52,940
And read great books

424
00:07:52,940 --> 00:07:54,140
and make extracts.

425
00:07:55,760 --> 00:07:56,580
Mary wished

426
00:07:56,580 --> 00:07:56,880
to say

427
00:07:56,880 --> 00:07:57,980
something sensible.

428
00:07:57,980 --> 00:07:59,300
But knew not how.

429
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:00,980
Well Mary is

430
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:02,220
adjusting her ideas.

431
00:08:02,460 --> 00:08:03,480
He continued.

432
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:04,760
Let us return to Mr.

433
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:05,720
Bingley.

434
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:07,200
I am sick of Mr.

435
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:07,980
Bingley.

436
00:08:07,980 --> 00:08:09,140
Cried his wife.

437
00:08:09,140 --> 00:08:10,560
I'm sorry to hear that.

438
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:11,640
But why did you not

439
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:12,840
tell me so before?

440
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:13,700
If I had known

441
00:08:13,700 --> 00:08:14,900
as much this morning.

442
00:08:14,940 --> 00:08:15,660
I certainly would

443
00:08:15,660 --> 00:08:16,860
not have called on him.

444
00:08:16,860 --> 00:08:18,120
It is very unlucky.

445
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:19,140
But as I have

446
00:08:19,140 --> 00:08:20,240
actually paid the visit,

447
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:21,080
we cannot escape

448
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:22,320
the acquaintance now.

449
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:23,720
The astonishment

450
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:24,420
of the ladies was.

451
00:08:24,420 --> 00:08:25,620
Just what he wished.

452
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:26,400
That of Mrs.

453
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:26,700
Bennett,

454
00:08:26,700 --> 00:08:27,140
perhaps

455
00:08:27,140 --> 00:08:28,340
surpassing the rest.

456
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:29,580
The When the first.

457
00:08:29,580 --> 00:08:30,980
Tumult of joy was over,

458
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:31,740
she began

459
00:08:31,740 --> 00:08:32,280
to declare that

460
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:32,700
it was what

461
00:08:32,700 --> 00:08:33,680
she had expected.

462
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:34,880
All the while.

463
00:08:35,220 --> 00:08:36,500
How good it was.

464
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:37,820
And you, my dear Mr.

465
00:08:37,820 --> 00:08:38,760
Bennett.

466
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:39,800
But I knew I should

467
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:41,000
persuade you at last.

468
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,040
I was sure you loved

469
00:08:42,040 --> 00:08:42,840
all girls too

470
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:43,520
well to neglect

471
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:44,720
such an acquaintance.

472
00:08:44,940 --> 00:08:45,920
Well,

473
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:47,520
how pleased I am.

474
00:08:47,780 --> 00:08:48,520
And it is such

475
00:08:48,520 --> 00:08:49,760
a good joke to that.

476
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:50,480
You should have gone

477
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:51,040
this morning

478
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:51,740
and never said

479
00:08:51,740 --> 00:08:52,440
a word about it

480
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:53,640
till now.

481
00:08:53,820 --> 00:08:54,840
Now, Kitty,

482
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:56,000
you may cough

483
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,400
as much as you choose.

484
00:08:57,640 --> 00:08:58,200
Said Mr.

485
00:08:58,200 --> 00:08:58,860
Bennett.

486
00:08:58,860 --> 00:08:59,900
And as he spoke,

487
00:08:59,900 --> 00:09:00,980
he left the room

488
00:09:00,980 --> 00:09:01,640
fatigued.

489
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:01,860
With the

490
00:09:01,860 --> 00:09:03,120
raptures of his wife.

491
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:04,660
What an excellent.

492
00:09:04,660 --> 00:09:06,080
Father you have, girls?

493
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:07,080
Said she.

494
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:08,280
When the door was shut.

495
00:09:08,300 --> 00:09:09,240
I do not know

496
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:10,080
how you will ever make

497
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:10,520
him amends

498
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:11,720
for his kindness.

499
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:12,560
Or me either,

500
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:13,760
for that matter.

501
00:09:13,900 --> 00:09:14,960
At our time of life,

502
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:15,960
it is not so pleasant.

503
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:16,880
I can tell you

504
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:17,400
to be making

505
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:18,140
new acquaintances

506
00:09:18,140 --> 00:09:19,040
every day.

507
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:20,160
But for your sake,

508
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:21,420
we would do anything.

509
00:09:21,980 --> 00:09:22,500
Lydia.

510
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:23,300
My love,

511
00:09:23,300 --> 00:09:23,520
though

512
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:24,720
you are the youngest.

513
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:25,920
I daresay Mr.

514
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:26,720
Bingley will dance

515
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:27,180
with you

516
00:09:27,180 --> 00:09:28,380
at the next ball.

517
00:09:28,940 --> 00:09:30,020
Oh, said

518
00:09:30,020 --> 00:09:31,220
Lydia stoutly.

519
00:09:31,460 --> 00:09:32,660
I am not afraid

520
00:09:32,780 --> 00:09:33,260
for their life.

521
00:09:33,260 --> 00:09:34,460
I am the youngest.

522
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:35,700
I am the tallest.

523
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:37,560
The rest of the evening

524
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:38,000
was spent

525
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
in conjecturing

526
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:39,680
how soon

527
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:40,460
he would return Mr.

528
00:09:40,460 --> 00:09:41,460
Bennett's visit

529
00:09:41,460 --> 00:09:42,240
and determining

530
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:42,660
when they

531
00:09:42,660 --> 00:09:43,160
should ask

532
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:43,920
him to dinner.

533
00:09:45,900 --> 00:09:47,100
Chapter three.

534
00:09:48,380 --> 00:09:49,400
Not all that, Mrs.

535
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:50,340
Bennett, however,

536
00:09:50,340 --> 00:09:51,180
with the assistance

537
00:09:51,180 --> 00:09:52,260
of her five daughters,

538
00:09:52,260 --> 00:09:52,800
could ask

539
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:53,760
on the subject.

540
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:54,000
Was.

541
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:54,560
Sufficient

542
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:55,760
to draw from her husband

543
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:56,840
any satisfactory

544
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:57,920
description of Mr.

545
00:09:57,920 --> 00:09:58,800
Bingley.

546
00:09:58,800 --> 00:09:59,640
They attacked him

547
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:00,840
in various ways

548
00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:01,820
with barefaced

549
00:10:01,820 --> 00:10:02,600
questions,

550
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:04,160
ingenious suppositions

551
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:05,960
and distant surmises.

552
00:10:06,420 --> 00:10:07,400
But he eluded

553
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:08,600
the skill of them all,

554
00:10:08,660 --> 00:10:09,240
and they were

555
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:10,160
at last obliged

556
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:10,700
to accept

557
00:10:10,700 --> 00:10:11,400
the second hand

558
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:12,020
intelligence

559
00:10:12,020 --> 00:10:12,920
of their neighbor,

560
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:14,120
Lady Lucas.

561
00:10:14,220 --> 00:10:15,080
Her report was

562
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:16,280
highly favorable.

563
00:10:16,460 --> 00:10:17,480
Sir William had been

564
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:18,680
delighted with him.

565
00:10:18,740 --> 00:10:19,920
He was quite young,

566
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:21,120
wonderfully handsome,

567
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:22,460
extremely agreeable,

568
00:10:22,620 --> 00:10:24,120
and to crown the whole.

569
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:24,960
He meant to.

570
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:26,100
Be at the next assembly

571
00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:27,300
with a large party.

572
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:28,500
Nothing could be

573
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:29,700
more delightful.

574
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:30,780
To be. Fond of.

575
00:10:30,780 --> 00:10:31,440
Dancing was a

576
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:32,060
certain step

577
00:10:32,060 --> 00:10:33,260
towards falling in love

578
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:34,740
and very lively hopes

579
00:10:34,740 --> 00:10:35,100
of Mr.

580
00:10:35,100 --> 00:10:35,940
Bailey's heart

581
00:10:35,940 --> 00:10:37,140
were entertained.

582
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:39,060
If I can

583
00:10:39,060 --> 00:10:39,540
but see

584
00:10:39,540 --> 00:10:40,800
one of my daughters

585
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:41,400
happily

586
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:42,660
settled at Netherfield.

587
00:10:43,020 --> 00:10:43,560
Said Mrs.

588
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:44,760
Bennett to her husband.

589
00:10:44,900 --> 00:10:45,900
And all the others

590
00:10:45,900 --> 00:10:47,100
equally well married.

591
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:48,380
I shall have nothing

592
00:10:48,380 --> 00:10:49,580
to wish for.

593
00:10:50,060 --> 00:10:51,120
In a few days.

594
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:51,500
Mr.

595
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:52,620
Bingley returned Mr.

596
00:10:52,620 --> 00:10:53,540
Bennett's visit

597
00:10:53,540 --> 00:10:55,040
and sat about 10 minutes

598
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:56,280
with him in his library.

599
00:10:56,660 --> 00:10:57,860
He had entertained hopes

600
00:10:57,860 --> 00:10:58,520
of being admitted

601
00:10:58,520 --> 00:10:58,980
to a sight

602
00:10:58,980 --> 00:11:00,060
of the young ladies.

603
00:11:00,060 --> 00:11:00,840
Of whose beauty.

604
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:02,000
He had heard much.

605
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:02,640
But he saw.

606
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:03,840
Only the father.

607
00:11:03,980 --> 00:11:04,800
The ladies were

608
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:06,000
somewhat more fortunate,

609
00:11:06,180 --> 00:11:06,800
for they had

610
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:07,440
the advantage

611
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:08,120
of ascertaining

612
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:09,240
from an upper window

613
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:10,800
that he wore a blue coat

614
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:12,260
and rode a black horse.

615
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:14,340
An invitation to dinner

616
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:14,700
was soon

617
00:11:14,700 --> 00:11:15,900
afterwards dispatched

618
00:11:16,100 --> 00:11:17,280
and already had Mrs.

619
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:18,000
Bennett planned

620
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:18,620
the courses

621
00:11:18,620 --> 00:11:19,500
that were to do credit

622
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:20,660
to her housekeeping.

623
00:11:20,660 --> 00:11:21,860
When an answer arrived

624
00:11:21,860 --> 00:11:22,500
which differed

625
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:23,700
at all, Mr.

626
00:11:23,700 --> 00:11:24,680
Bingley was obliged

627
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:25,440
to be in town

628
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:26,600
the following day

629
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:27,840
and consequently unable

630
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:28,820
to accept the honor

631
00:11:28,820 --> 00:11:29,100
of their

632
00:11:29,100 --> 00:11:30,360
invitation, etc..

633
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:31,220
Mrs.

634
00:11:31,220 --> 00:11:31,680
Bennett was

635
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:32,960
quite disconcerted.

636
00:11:33,260 --> 00:11:34,340
She could not imagine

637
00:11:34,340 --> 00:11:34,640
what.

638
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:35,060
Business

639
00:11:35,060 --> 00:11:35,900
he could have in town

640
00:11:35,900 --> 00:11:36,480
so soon

641
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:37,260
after his arrival

642
00:11:37,260 --> 00:11:38,300
in Hertfordshire,

643
00:11:38,300 --> 00:11:39,200
and she began to fear

644
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:40,440
that he might be always

645
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:41,000
flying about

646
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:41,760
from one place

647
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:42,500
to another

648
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:43,340
and never settled

649
00:11:43,340 --> 00:11:44,180
at Netherfield, as he.

650
00:11:44,180 --> 00:11:45,260
Ought to be.

651
00:11:45,260 --> 00:11:45,980
Lady Lucas

652
00:11:45,980 --> 00:11:46,860
quieted her fears

653
00:11:46,860 --> 00:11:48,080
a little by starting

654
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:48,920
the idea of his

655
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:49,380
being gone

656
00:11:49,380 --> 00:11:49,940
to London,

657
00:11:49,940 --> 00:11:50,540
only to get

658
00:11:50,540 --> 00:11:51,320
a large party

659
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:52,320
for the ball.

660
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:53,220
And a report soon

661
00:11:53,220 --> 00:11:54,020
followed that Mr.

662
00:11:54,020 --> 00:11:54,840
Bingley was to bring

663
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:56,300
12 ladies and seven

664
00:11:56,300 --> 00:11:57,140
gentlemen with him

665
00:11:57,140 --> 00:11:58,340
to the assembly.

666
00:11:58,460 --> 00:11:59,700
The girls grieved over

667
00:11:59,700 --> 00:12:00,900
such a number of ladies,

668
00:12:01,140 --> 00:12:02,000
but were comforted

669
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:02,280
the day

670
00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:02,960
before the ball

671
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:03,800
by hearing

672
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:05,000
that instead of 12

673
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:06,360
he brought only six

674
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:07,560
with him from London.

675
00:12:07,580 --> 00:12:08,980
His five sisters and

676
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:09,980
a cousin.

677
00:12:09,980 --> 00:12:10,920
And when the party

678
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:11,280
entered the

679
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:12,420
assembly room. It.

680
00:12:12,420 --> 00:12:12,920
Consisted

681
00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:14,360
of only five altogether.

682
00:12:14,820 --> 00:12:15,200
Mr.

683
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:15,780
Bingley,

684
00:12:15,780 --> 00:12:16,980
his two sisters.

685
00:12:17,060 --> 00:12:17,720
The husband.

686
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:18,620
Of the eldest,

687
00:12:18,620 --> 00:12:19,820
and another young man.

688
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:20,640
Mr.

689
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:21,420
Bingley was good

690
00:12:21,420 --> 00:12:22,020
looking and

691
00:12:22,020 --> 00:12:23,060
gentleman like.

692
00:12:23,060 --> 00:12:23,480
He had a

693
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:24,680
pleasant countenance

694
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:25,500
and easy,

695
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:26,760
unaffected manners.

696
00:12:27,180 --> 00:12:28,460
His sisters were fine

697
00:12:28,460 --> 00:12:29,060
women

698
00:12:29,060 --> 00:12:30,300
with an air of decided

699
00:12:30,300 --> 00:12:31,340
fashion.

700
00:12:31,340 --> 00:12:32,580
His brother in law, Mr.

701
00:12:32,580 --> 00:12:33,480
Hurst, merely

702
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:34,680
looked the gentleman,

703
00:12:34,820 --> 00:12:35,940
but his friend, Mr.

704
00:12:35,940 --> 00:12:36,840
Darcy, soon

705
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:37,560
drew the attention

706
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:38,840
of the room by his fine,

707
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:39,960
tall person.

708
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:41,160
Handsome features

709
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:42,200
noble mien

710
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:42,980
and the report,

711
00:12:42,980 --> 00:12:43,440
which was in

712
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:44,400
general circulation

713
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:45,260
within 5 minutes

714
00:12:45,260 --> 00:12:46,280
after his entrance

715
00:12:46,280 --> 00:12:48,180
of his having 10,000

716
00:12:48,180 --> 00:12:49,220
a year.

717
00:12:49,220 --> 00:12:49,940
The gentleman

718
00:12:49,940 --> 00:12:50,520
pronounced him

719
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:50,720
to be

720
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:52,040
a fine figure of a man.

721
00:12:52,340 --> 00:12:53,480
The ladies declared

722
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:54,660
he was much handsomer

723
00:12:54,660 --> 00:12:55,040
than Mr.

724
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:55,740
Bingley,

725
00:12:55,740 --> 00:12:56,420
and he was looked

726
00:12:56,420 --> 00:12:57,740
at with great admiration

727
00:12:57,740 --> 00:12:58,380
for about half

728
00:12:58,380 --> 00:12:59,280
the evening

729
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:00,320
till his manners

730
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:01,140
gave a disgust

731
00:13:01,140 --> 00:13:02,040
which turned the tide

732
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:03,240
of his popularity.

733
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:04,460
For he was discovered

734
00:13:04,460 --> 00:13:05,580
to be proud,

735
00:13:05,580 --> 00:13:07,160
to be above his company

736
00:13:07,380 --> 00:13:08,880
and above being pleased.

737
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:09,780
And not all

738
00:13:09,780 --> 00:13:10,580
his large estate

739
00:13:10,580 --> 00:13:11,340
in Derbyshire

740
00:13:11,340 --> 00:13:12,240
could then save him

741
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:12,660
from having

742
00:13:12,660 --> 00:13:13,580
a most forbidding,

743
00:13:13,580 --> 00:13:14,940
disagreeable countenance

744
00:13:15,140 --> 00:13:16,220
and being unworthy

745
00:13:16,220 --> 00:13:16,920
to be compared

746
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:18,120
with his friend.

747
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:18,480
Mr.

748
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:19,320
Bingley had soon

749
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:19,820
made himself

750
00:13:19,820 --> 00:13:20,300
acquainted

751
00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:21,120
with all the principal

752
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:22,280
people in the room.

753
00:13:22,280 --> 00:13:23,240
He was lively

754
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:24,780
and unreserved, danced

755
00:13:24,780 --> 00:13:26,420
every dance, was angry

756
00:13:26,420 --> 00:13:27,380
that the ball closed

757
00:13:27,380 --> 00:13:28,280
so early

758
00:13:28,280 --> 00:13:28,800
and talked

759
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:29,820
of giving one himself

760
00:13:29,820 --> 00:13:31,020
at another field.

761
00:13:31,020 --> 00:13:32,300
Such amiable qualities

762
00:13:32,300 --> 00:13:32,880
must speak

763
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:33,920
for themselves.

764
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:35,040
What a contrast

765
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:35,660
between him

766
00:13:35,660 --> 00:13:36,680
and his friend.

767
00:13:36,680 --> 00:13:37,040
Mr.

768
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:37,520
Darcy

769
00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:38,220
danced only

770
00:13:38,220 --> 00:13:39,080
once with Mrs.

771
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:39,480
Hurst

772
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:40,200
and once with

773
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:41,820
Miss Bingley declined

774
00:13:41,820 --> 00:13:42,540
being introduced

775
00:13:42,540 --> 00:13:43,700
to any other lady

776
00:13:43,700 --> 00:13:44,540
and spent the rest

777
00:13:44,540 --> 00:13:45,120
of the evening

778
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:45,660
in walking

779
00:13:45,660 --> 00:13:47,060
about the room, speaking

780
00:13:47,060 --> 00:13:47,760
occasionally

781
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:49,140
to one of his own party.

782
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:50,520
His character

783
00:13:50,520 --> 00:13:51,720
was decided

784
00:13:51,780 --> 00:13:53,160
he was the proudest.

785
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:53,400
Most.

786
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:54,540
Disagreeable man

787
00:13:54,540 --> 00:13:55,340
in the world,

788
00:13:55,340 --> 00:13:56,480
and everybody hoped that

789
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:57,060
he would never

790
00:13:57,060 --> 00:13:58,260
come there again.

791
00:13:58,280 --> 00:13:59,660
Amongst the most violent

792
00:13:59,660 --> 00:14:00,600
against him was Mrs.

793
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:01,260
Bennett.

794
00:14:01,260 --> 00:14:02,160
Whose dislike of his.

795
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:02,960
General behavior

796
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:03,480
was sharpened

797
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:04,160
into particular

798
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:04,940
resentment

799
00:14:04,940 --> 00:14:06,540
by his having slighted

800
00:14:06,540 --> 00:14:07,740
one of her daughters.

801
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:09,260
Elizabeth Bennett

802
00:14:09,260 --> 00:14:10,320
had been obliged

803
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:11,240
by the scarcity of.

804
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:12,360
Gentlemen to sit.

805
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:13,580
Down for two dances,

806
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:14,520
and during

807
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:15,980
part of that time, Mr.

808
00:14:15,980 --> 00:14:17,120
Darcy had been standing

809
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:17,600
near enough

810
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:18,140
for her to hear a.

811
00:14:18,140 --> 00:14:18,840
Conversation

812
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:19,320
between him and.

813
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:19,560
Mr.

814
00:14:19,560 --> 00:14:20,240
Bingley,

815
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:21,320
who came from the dance

816
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:22,320
for a few minutes

817
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:23,360
to press his friend

818
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:24,560
to join it.

819
00:14:24,620 --> 00:14:25,820
Come, Darcy.

820
00:14:25,820 --> 00:14:26,660
Said he.

821
00:14:26,660 --> 00:14:27,740
I must have you dance.

822
00:14:27,740 --> 00:14:28,500
I hate to see you

823
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:29,060
standing about

824
00:14:29,060 --> 00:14:29,660
by yourself in

825
00:14:29,660 --> 00:14:30,560
this stupid manner.

826
00:14:31,740 --> 00:14:32,280
You had much

827
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:33,480
better dance.

828
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:34,940
I certainly shall not.

829
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:35,820
You know

830
00:14:35,820 --> 00:14:37,020
how I detest it.

831
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:38,120
Unless I am particularly

832
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:38,720
acquainted with

833
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:39,920
my partner

834
00:14:40,940 --> 00:14:41,840
at such an assembly

835
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:42,180
as this,

836
00:14:42,180 --> 00:14:42,540
it would be

837
00:14:42,540 --> 00:14:43,740
insupportable.

838
00:14:44,460 --> 00:14:45,800
Your sisters are engaged

839
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:47,180
and there is not

840
00:14:47,180 --> 00:14:47,780
another woman

841
00:14:47,780 --> 00:14:48,300
in the room

842
00:14:48,300 --> 00:14:49,040
whom it would not be

843
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:49,820
a punishment to me

844
00:14:49,820 --> 00:14:51,020
to stand up with.

845
00:14:51,620 --> 00:14:52,280
I would not be

846
00:14:52,280 --> 00:14:53,100
so fastidious

847
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:54,120
as you are.

848
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:55,160
Cried Bingley.

849
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:56,360
For a kingdom

850
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:57,300
upon my honor.

851
00:14:57,300 --> 00:14:57,960
I never met with

852
00:14:57,960 --> 00:14:58,800
so many pleasant

853
00:14:58,800 --> 00:14:59,700
girls in my life

854
00:14:59,700 --> 00:15:00,900
as I have this evening,

855
00:15:01,340 --> 00:15:02,040
and there are several

856
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:02,280
of them

857
00:15:02,280 --> 00:15:03,140
you see uncommonly

858
00:15:03,140 --> 00:15:04,340
pretty.

859
00:15:05,820 --> 00:15:06,600
You are dancing

860
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:07,500
with the only handsome

861
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:08,640
girl in the room.

862
00:15:08,640 --> 00:15:09,140
Said Mr.

863
00:15:09,140 --> 00:15:10,020
Darcy, looking

864
00:15:10,020 --> 00:15:10,640
at the eldest,

865
00:15:10,640 --> 00:15:11,840
Miss Bennet.

866
00:15:12,860 --> 00:15:13,580
Oh, she is the most

867
00:15:13,580 --> 00:15:14,300
beautiful creature

868
00:15:14,300 --> 00:15:15,060
I ever beheld.

869
00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:17,220
But there is one

870
00:15:17,220 --> 00:15:17,400
of her

871
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:18,260
sisters sitting down

872
00:15:18,260 --> 00:15:18,960
just behind you

873
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:19,800
who is very pretty

874
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:20,480
and I daresay,

875
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:21,680
very agreeable.

876
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:24,680
Do let me ask my partner

877
00:15:24,680 --> 00:15:25,880
to introduce you.

878
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:27,540
Which

879
00:15:27,540 --> 00:15:28,740
do you mean?

880
00:15:28,740 --> 00:15:29,760
And turning round.

881
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:30,240
He looked for

882
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:31,440
a moment at Elizabeth

883
00:15:31,460 --> 00:15:32,880
till catching her eye.

884
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,140
He withdrew his own

885
00:15:34,140 --> 00:15:35,340
and coldly said.

886
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:37,260
She's tolerable

887
00:15:37,260 --> 00:15:37,940
but not handsome

888
00:15:37,940 --> 00:15:39,140
enough to tempt me.

889
00:15:39,980 --> 00:15:40,880
And I am in no humor

890
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:41,280
at present

891
00:15:41,280 --> 00:15:42,020
to give consequence

892
00:15:42,020 --> 00:15:42,740
to young ladies

893
00:15:42,740 --> 00:15:43,500
who are slighted

894
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:44,700
by other men.

895
00:15:45,020 --> 00:15:45,900
You had better return

896
00:15:45,900 --> 00:15:46,560
to your partner

897
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:47,760
and enjoy her smiles.

898
00:15:48,020 --> 00:15:48,740
For you are wasting

899
00:15:48,740 --> 00:15:49,940
your time with me.

900
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:51,420
Mr.

901
00:15:51,420 --> 00:15:52,140
Bingley followed

902
00:15:52,140 --> 00:15:53,340
his advice.

903
00:15:53,580 --> 00:15:53,940
Mr.

904
00:15:53,940 --> 00:15:55,140
Darcy walked off

905
00:15:55,220 --> 00:15:56,400
and Elizabeth remained

906
00:15:56,400 --> 00:15:56,840
with no

907
00:15:56,840 --> 00:15:58,040
very cordial feelings

908
00:15:58,040 --> 00:15:59,240
towards him.

909
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:00,440
She told the.

910
00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:01,100
Story, however,

911
00:16:01,100 --> 00:16:02,000
with great spirit

912
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,200
among her friends,

913
00:16:03,540 --> 00:16:04,620
for she had a lively,

914
00:16:04,620 --> 00:16:05,820
playful disposition,

915
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:06,780
which delighted

916
00:16:06,780 --> 00:16:08,040
in anything ridiculous.

917
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:09,500
The evening

918
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:10,520
altogether passed off

919
00:16:10,520 --> 00:16:11,120
pleasantly to

920
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:12,300
the whole family.

921
00:16:12,300 --> 00:16:12,680
Mrs.

922
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:13,380
Bennet had seen

923
00:16:13,380 --> 00:16:14,300
her eldest daughter,

924
00:16:14,300 --> 00:16:15,060
much admired

925
00:16:15,060 --> 00:16:15,260
by the

926
00:16:15,260 --> 00:16:16,460
Netherfield party.

927
00:16:16,580 --> 00:16:16,980
Mr.

928
00:16:16,980 --> 00:16:17,300
Bingley

929
00:16:17,300 --> 00:16:17,720
had danced

930
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:18,600
with her twice.

931
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:19,020
And she had

932
00:16:19,020 --> 00:16:19,800
been distinguished

933
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:21,000
by his sisters.

934
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:21,920
Jane was as

935
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:23,160
much gratified by this

936
00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:23,820
as her mother could.

937
00:16:23,820 --> 00:16:24,720
Be, though in a.

938
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:25,920
Quieter way.

939
00:16:26,100 --> 00:16:27,080
Elizabeth felt

940
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:28,280
Jane's pleasure.

941
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:29,580
Mary had heard herself

942
00:16:29,580 --> 00:16:30,020
mentioned to

943
00:16:30,020 --> 00:16:30,620
Miss Bingley

944
00:16:30,620 --> 00:16:31,080
as the most

945
00:16:31,080 --> 00:16:32,000
accomplished girl

946
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:32,960
in the neighborhood,

947
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:34,100
and Catherine and Lydia

948
00:16:34,100 --> 00:16:34,880
had been fortunate

949
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:35,220
enough

950
00:16:35,220 --> 00:16:35,720
never to be

951
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:36,840
without partners,

952
00:16:36,840 --> 00:16:37,520
which was all that

953
00:16:37,520 --> 00:16:37,980
they had yet

954
00:16:37,980 --> 00:16:38,700
learned to care

955
00:16:38,700 --> 00:16:39,900
for at a ball.

956
00:16:40,080 --> 00:16:41,180
They returned, therefore

957
00:16:41,180 --> 00:16:41,960
in good spirits

958
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:42,900
to long borne

959
00:16:42,900 --> 00:16:43,460
the village

960
00:16:43,460 --> 00:16:44,340
where they lived.

961
00:16:44,340 --> 00:16:45,060
And of which.

962
00:16:45,060 --> 00:16:45,320
They were

963
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:45,900
the principal

964
00:16:45,900 --> 00:16:47,000
inhabitants.

965
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:47,820
They found Mr.

966
00:16:47,820 --> 00:16:48,980
Bennett still up.

967
00:16:48,980 --> 00:16:49,620
With. A book.

968
00:16:49,620 --> 00:16:49,920
He was,

969
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:51,120
regardless of time,

970
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:51,720
and on the

971
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:52,460
present occasion

972
00:16:52,460 --> 00:16:52,680
he had

973
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:53,900
a good deal of curiosity

974
00:16:53,900 --> 00:16:54,620
as to the events

975
00:16:54,620 --> 00:16:55,380
of an evening.

976
00:16:55,380 --> 00:16:56,060
Which had raised.

977
00:16:56,060 --> 00:16:56,900
Such splendid.

978
00:16:56,900 --> 00:16:58,100
Expectations.

979
00:16:58,440 --> 00:16:59,280
He had rather hoped

980
00:16:59,280 --> 00:17:00,260
that his wife's views on

981
00:17:00,260 --> 00:17:00,780
the stranger

982
00:17:00,780 --> 00:17:01,940
would be disappointed.

983
00:17:01,940 --> 00:17:02,640
But he soon.

984
00:17:02,640 --> 00:17:03,320
Found out that

985
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:04,280
he had a different story

986
00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:05,160
to hear.

987
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:06,580
Oh, my dear Mr.

988
00:17:06,580 --> 00:17:07,300
Bennett,

989
00:17:07,300 --> 00:17:08,520
as she entered the room.

990
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:08,960
We have

991
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:09,240
had a

992
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:10,560
most delightful evening,

993
00:17:10,560 --> 00:17:12,200
a most excellent ball.

994
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:13,580
I wish you had been

995
00:17:13,580 --> 00:17:14,240
there.

996
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:15,880
Jane was so admired.

997
00:17:15,900 --> 00:17:16,580
Nothing could be

998
00:17:16,580 --> 00:17:17,420
like it.

999
00:17:17,420 --> 00:17:18,440
Everybody said how

1000
00:17:18,440 --> 00:17:20,120
well she looked, and Mr.

1001
00:17:20,120 --> 00:17:20,660
Bingley

1002
00:17:20,660 --> 00:17:21,080
thought her

1003
00:17:21,080 --> 00:17:22,380
quite beautiful

1004
00:17:22,380 --> 00:17:23,240
and danced

1005
00:17:23,240 --> 00:17:24,440
with her twice.

1006
00:17:24,620 --> 00:17:25,800
Only think of that,

1007
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:26,400
my dear.

1008
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:27,680
He actually danced

1009
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:28,880
with her twice.

1010
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:29,400
And she was

1011
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:30,100
the only creature

1012
00:17:30,100 --> 00:17:30,500
in the room

1013
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:30,960
that he asked

1014
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:32,160
a second time.

1015
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:33,020
First of all,

1016
00:17:33,020 --> 00:17:33,660
he asked Mr.

1017
00:17:33,660 --> 00:17:34,560
Lucas.

1018
00:17:34,560 --> 00:17:35,720
I was so Becks

1019
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:36,200
to see him

1020
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:37,400
stand up with her.

1021
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:38,800
But however, he did

1022
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:40,020
not admire her at all.

1023
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:41,160
Indeed, nobody can,

1024
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:41,940
you know.

1025
00:17:41,940 --> 00:17:42,580
And he seemed

1026
00:17:42,580 --> 00:17:43,940
quite struck with Jane

1027
00:17:43,940 --> 00:17:44,280
as she was

1028
00:17:44,280 --> 00:17:45,480
going down the dance.

1029
00:17:45,580 --> 00:17:46,440
So he inquired

1030
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:47,040
who she was

1031
00:17:47,040 --> 00:17:47,960
and got introduced

1032
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:48,620
and asked her

1033
00:17:48,620 --> 00:17:49,820
for the next two.

1034
00:17:50,060 --> 00:17:51,260
Then the two third,

1035
00:17:51,260 --> 00:17:52,640
he danced with Miss King

1036
00:17:52,920 --> 00:17:53,840
and the two fourth

1037
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:54,860
Mariah Lucas

1038
00:17:54,860 --> 00:17:56,600
and the 2/5 Jane again.

1039
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:58,160
And the two six with

1040
00:17:58,160 --> 00:17:59,620
Lizzie and the Bull.

1041
00:18:01,140 --> 00:18:02,000
If he had had any

1042
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,200
compassion for me.

1043
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:03,920
Cried her

1044
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:05,120
husband impatiently.

1045
00:18:05,560 --> 00:18:06,480
He would not have danced

1046
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:07,680
half so much.

1047
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:08,760
For God's sake,

1048
00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:09,180
say no

1049
00:18:09,180 --> 00:18:10,380
more of his partners.

1050
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:11,420
Oh, that he had sprained

1051
00:18:11,420 --> 00:18:11,960
his ankle

1052
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:13,160
in the first dance.

1053
00:18:13,820 --> 00:18:15,020
Oh, my dear.

1054
00:18:15,060 --> 00:18:16,020
I am quite

1055
00:18:16,020 --> 00:18:17,000
delighted with him.

1056
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,580
He is so excessively

1057
00:18:18,580 --> 00:18:19,400
handsome

1058
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:20,180
and his sisters

1059
00:18:20,180 --> 00:18:21,380
are charming women.

1060
00:18:21,380 --> 00:18:22,460
I never in my life

1061
00:18:22,460 --> 00:18:22,880
saw anything

1062
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:23,420
more elegant

1063
00:18:23,420 --> 00:18:24,480
than their dresses.

1064
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:25,680
I dare say the lace

1065
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:26,240
upon Mrs.

1066
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:27,440
Hurst's gown.

1067
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:28,860
Here she was interrupted

1068
00:18:28,860 --> 00:18:29,880
again. Mr.

1069
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:30,200
Bennett

1070
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:31,140
protested against

1071
00:18:31,140 --> 00:18:31,920
any description

1072
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:32,900
of finery.

1073
00:18:32,900 --> 00:18:33,240
She was

1074
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:34,040
therefore obliged

1075
00:18:34,040 --> 00:18:34,340
to seek

1076
00:18:34,340 --> 00:18:34,920
another branch

1077
00:18:34,920 --> 00:18:35,820
of the subject

1078
00:18:35,820 --> 00:18:36,660
and related.

1079
00:18:36,660 --> 00:18:36,920
With.

1080
00:18:36,920 --> 00:18:37,740
Much bitterness

1081
00:18:37,740 --> 00:18:38,340
of spirit

1082
00:18:38,340 --> 00:18:39,600
and some exaggeration.

1083
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:41,000
The shocking rudeness

1084
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,200
of Mr. Darcy.

1085
00:18:42,540 --> 00:18:44,240
But I can assure you,

1086
00:18:44,520 --> 00:18:45,440
she added,

1087
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:46,160
that Lizzie

1088
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:47,240
does not lose much

1089
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:47,880
by not suiting

1090
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:49,080
his fancy,

1091
00:18:49,160 --> 00:18:49,920
but he is a

1092
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:51,260
most disagreeable,

1093
00:18:51,320 --> 00:18:52,340
horrid man.

1094
00:18:52,340 --> 00:18:52,920
Not at all

1095
00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:54,080
worth pleasing.

1096
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:55,160
So high

1097
00:18:55,160 --> 00:18:56,600
and so conceited that

1098
00:18:56,600 --> 00:18:57,260
there was no

1099
00:18:57,260 --> 00:18:58,460
enduring him.

1100
00:18:58,580 --> 00:18:59,900
He walked here

1101
00:18:59,900 --> 00:19:00,660
and he walked

1102
00:19:00,660 --> 00:19:01,460
that fence,

1103
00:19:01,460 --> 00:19:02,060
seeing himself

1104
00:19:02,060 --> 00:19:03,260
so very great.

1105
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:04,560
Not handsome

1106
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:05,760
enough to dance with.

1107
00:19:06,020 --> 00:19:06,840
I wish you would

1108
00:19:06,840 --> 00:19:07,260
be there,

1109
00:19:07,260 --> 00:19:08,000
my dear,

1110
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:08,600
to have given him

1111
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:09,800
one of your such downs.

1112
00:19:10,040 --> 00:19:10,940
I quite

1113
00:19:10,940 --> 00:19:12,140
detest the man.

1114
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:14,520
Chapter four.

1115
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:16,500
When Jane and

1116
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:17,700
Elizabeth were alone,

1117
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:18,560
the former

1118
00:19:18,560 --> 00:19:19,500
who had been cautious

1119
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:20,300
in her praise of Mr.

1120
00:19:20,300 --> 00:19:21,380
Bingley before,

1121
00:19:21,380 --> 00:19:22,560
expressed to her sister

1122
00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:23,480
just how very much

1123
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:24,680
she admired him.

1124
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:26,300
He is just what

1125
00:19:26,300 --> 00:19:27,600
a young man ought to be,

1126
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:28,980
said she.

1127
00:19:28,980 --> 00:19:29,960
Sensible,

1128
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:30,920
good humored.

1129
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:32,060
Live li.

1130
00:19:32,060 --> 00:19:33,140
And I never saw such

1131
00:19:33,140 --> 00:19:34,260
happy madness.

1132
00:19:34,260 --> 00:19:35,340
So much ease

1133
00:19:35,340 --> 00:19:36,440
with such perfect

1134
00:19:36,440 --> 00:19:37,640
good breeding.

1135
00:19:38,100 --> 00:19:39,440
He is also handsome.

1136
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:40,920
Replied Elizabeth.

1137
00:19:41,060 --> 00:19:42,180
Which young man ought.

1138
00:19:42,180 --> 00:19:43,020
Likewise to be

1139
00:19:43,020 --> 00:19:43,640
if he possibly.

1140
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:44,360
Can.

1141
00:19:44,360 --> 00:19:46,020
His character is thereby

1142
00:19:46,020 --> 00:19:47,220
complete.

1143
00:19:47,660 --> 00:19:48,500
I was very much.

1144
00:19:48,500 --> 00:19:49,380
Flattered by his

1145
00:19:49,380 --> 00:19:50,220
asking me to dance.

1146
00:19:50,220 --> 00:19:51,420
A second time.

1147
00:19:51,420 --> 00:19:52,440
I did not expect

1148
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:53,640
such a compliment.

1149
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:55,440
Did not you?

1150
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:56,700
I did for you.

1151
00:19:57,060 --> 00:19:58,520
But that is one great

1152
00:19:58,520 --> 00:19:59,720
difference between us.

1153
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:01,260
Compliments always take

1154
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:02,460
you by surprise.

1155
00:20:02,460 --> 00:20:03,660
And me? Never.

1156
00:20:04,100 --> 00:20:04,740
What could be

1157
00:20:04,740 --> 00:20:05,400
more natural.

1158
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:06,180
That his asking you.

1159
00:20:06,180 --> 00:20:06,920
Again?

1160
00:20:06,920 --> 00:20:07,500
He could not

1161
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:08,000
help, seeing

1162
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:08,340
that you were

1163
00:20:08,340 --> 00:20:09,540
about five times

1164
00:20:09,540 --> 00:20:09,980
as pretty

1165
00:20:09,980 --> 00:20:10,560
as every other

1166
00:20:10,560 --> 00:20:11,760
woman in the room.

1167
00:20:11,780 --> 00:20:12,380
No thanks

1168
00:20:12,380 --> 00:20:13,080
to his gallantry

1169
00:20:13,080 --> 00:20:14,160
for that.

1170
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:14,480
Well,

1171
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:15,320
he certainly is

1172
00:20:15,320 --> 00:20:16,280
very agreeable.

1173
00:20:16,280 --> 00:20:17,340
And I give you leave to

1174
00:20:17,340 --> 00:20:18,120
like him.

1175
00:20:18,120 --> 00:20:18,660
You've liked

1176
00:20:18,660 --> 00:20:19,860
many a stupider person.

1177
00:20:20,660 --> 00:20:21,860
Dear Lizzie.

1178
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:22,980
Oh, you are

1179
00:20:22,980 --> 00:20:23,780
a great deal.

1180
00:20:23,780 --> 00:20:24,440
Too apt,

1181
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:24,740
you know,

1182
00:20:24,740 --> 00:20:25,200
to like

1183
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:26,400
people in general.

1184
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:27,380
You never see a fault

1185
00:20:27,380 --> 00:20:28,460
with anybody.

1186
00:20:28,460 --> 00:20:29,960
All the world are good

1187
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:30,660
and agreeable

1188
00:20:30,660 --> 00:20:31,740
in your eyes.

1189
00:20:31,740 --> 00:20:33,020
I never heard you speak

1190
00:20:33,020 --> 00:20:33,620
ill of a human

1191
00:20:33,620 --> 00:20:34,820
being in your life.

1192
00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:36,020
I would not wish

1193
00:20:36,020 --> 00:20:36,800
to be hasty

1194
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:38,000
in censuring anyone.

1195
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:39,540
But I always speak

1196
00:20:39,540 --> 00:20:40,740
what I think.

1197
00:20:41,220 --> 00:20:42,420
I know you do.

1198
00:20:42,540 --> 00:20:43,620
And it is that which

1199
00:20:43,620 --> 00:20:44,820
makes the wonder

1200
00:20:45,060 --> 00:20:46,280
with your good sense

1201
00:20:46,280 --> 00:20:47,840
to be so honestly blind

1202
00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:48,500
to the follies

1203
00:20:48,500 --> 00:20:49,700
and nonsense of others.

1204
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:51,120
Affectation

1205
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:51,860
of candor is

1206
00:20:51,860 --> 00:20:52,700
common enough.

1207
00:20:52,700 --> 00:20:53,340
One meets

1208
00:20:53,340 --> 00:20:54,540
with it everywhere.

1209
00:20:54,680 --> 00:20:55,760
But to be candid,

1210
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:56,880
without ostentation

1211
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:57,860
or design,

1212
00:20:57,860 --> 00:20:58,680
to take the good

1213
00:20:58,680 --> 00:20:59,760
of everybody's character

1214
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:00,060
and make

1215
00:21:00,060 --> 00:21:01,140
it still better,

1216
00:21:01,140 --> 00:21:01,940
and to say nothing.

1217
00:21:01,940 --> 00:21:02,120
Of the.

1218
00:21:02,120 --> 00:21:03,000
Bad belongs

1219
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,200
to you alone.

1220
00:21:04,380 --> 00:21:05,060
And so you like

1221
00:21:05,060 --> 00:21:06,060
the Seven Sisters

1222
00:21:06,060 --> 00:21:07,260
to do you?

1223
00:21:07,320 --> 00:21:08,160
Their manners

1224
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:09,360
are not equal to his.

1225
00:21:10,260 --> 00:21:10,800
Certainly

1226
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:12,360
not at first.

1227
00:21:12,900 --> 00:21:13,500
But they are very

1228
00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:14,280
pleasing women

1229
00:21:14,280 --> 00:21:14,940
when you converse

1230
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:15,780
with them.

1231
00:21:15,780 --> 00:21:16,380
Miss being

1232
00:21:16,380 --> 00:21:16,940
used to live

1233
00:21:16,940 --> 00:21:17,780
with her brother

1234
00:21:17,780 --> 00:21:18,980
and keep his house.

1235
00:21:19,100 --> 00:21:20,480
And I am much mistaken.

1236
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:21,320
If we shall not find

1237
00:21:21,320 --> 00:21:22,400
a very charming neighbor

1238
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:23,600
in her.

1239
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:24,360
Elizabeth

1240
00:21:24,360 --> 00:21:25,560
listened in silence.

1241
00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:25,880
But.

1242
00:21:25,880 --> 00:21:27,080
Was not convinced.

1243
00:21:27,320 --> 00:21:28,100
Their behavior.

1244
00:21:28,100 --> 00:21:28,800
At the assembly

1245
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:30,020
had not been calculated

1246
00:21:30,020 --> 00:21:31,220
to please in general,

1247
00:21:31,460 --> 00:21:32,480
and with more quickness

1248
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:33,500
of observation

1249
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:34,400
and less pliant

1250
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:35,100
see of temper

1251
00:21:35,100 --> 00:21:36,020
than her sister,

1252
00:21:36,020 --> 00:21:36,840
and with a judgment

1253
00:21:36,840 --> 00:21:37,620
to un assailed

1254
00:21:37,620 --> 00:21:37,980
by any

1255
00:21:37,980 --> 00:21:39,180
attention to herself.

1256
00:21:39,300 --> 00:21:39,900
She was very

1257
00:21:39,900 --> 00:21:40,800
little disposed

1258
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:42,000
to approve them.

1259
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:43,100
They were, in fact,

1260
00:21:43,100 --> 00:21:44,420
very fine ladies.

1261
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:45,740
Not deficient in.

1262
00:21:45,740 --> 00:21:46,220
Good humor

1263
00:21:46,220 --> 00:21:47,300
when they were. Pleased.

1264
00:21:47,300 --> 00:21:48,180
Nor in the power

1265
00:21:48,180 --> 00:21:48,500
of making

1266
00:21:48,500 --> 00:21:49,380
themselves agreeable

1267
00:21:49,380 --> 00:21:50,480
when they chose it.

1268
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:51,440
But proud

1269
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:52,640
and conceited.

1270
00:21:52,820 --> 00:21:53,420
They were rather

1271
00:21:53,420 --> 00:21:54,120
handsome,

1272
00:21:54,120 --> 00:21:55,080
had been educated

1273
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:55,460
in one of the

1274
00:21:55,460 --> 00:21:56,160
first private

1275
00:21:56,160 --> 00:21:57,360
seminaries in town.

1276
00:21:57,540 --> 00:21:58,280
Had a fortune of.

1277
00:21:58,280 --> 00:21:59,820
?20,000, were

1278
00:21:59,820 --> 00:22:00,360
in the habit

1279
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:01,220
of spending more than.

1280
00:22:01,220 --> 00:22:02,160
They ought and of.

1281
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:02,780
Associating

1282
00:22:02,780 --> 00:22:03,980
with people of rank,

1283
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:05,040
and were therefore, in

1284
00:22:05,040 --> 00:22:06,440
every respect entitled

1285
00:22:06,440 --> 00:22:06,740
to think

1286
00:22:06,740 --> 00:22:07,680
well of themselves

1287
00:22:07,680 --> 00:22:08,960
and meanly of others.

1288
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:09,860
They were

1289
00:22:09,860 --> 00:22:11,120
of a respectable family

1290
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:12,320
in the north of England,

1291
00:22:12,360 --> 00:22:13,260
a circumstance

1292
00:22:13,260 --> 00:22:13,820
more deeply

1293
00:22:13,820 --> 00:22:14,360
impressed on

1294
00:22:14,360 --> 00:22:15,300
their memories than that

1295
00:22:15,300 --> 00:22:16,500
their brothers, fortune

1296
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:17,220
and their own

1297
00:22:17,220 --> 00:22:18,180
had been acquired

1298
00:22:18,180 --> 00:22:19,380
by trade.

1299
00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:20,100
Mr.

1300
00:22:20,100 --> 00:22:20,520
Bingley

1301
00:22:20,520 --> 00:22:21,620
inherited property

1302
00:22:21,620 --> 00:22:22,200
to the amount

1303
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:23,960
of nearly ?100,000

1304
00:22:23,960 --> 00:22:24,960
from his father,

1305
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:25,760
who had intended

1306
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:26,960
to purchase an estate.

1307
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:27,360
But did.

1308
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:28,560
Not live to do it.

1309
00:22:28,980 --> 00:22:29,360
Mr.

1310
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:30,300
Bingley intended it

1311
00:22:30,300 --> 00:22:31,160
likewise.

1312
00:22:31,160 --> 00:22:31,920
And sometimes.

1313
00:22:31,920 --> 00:22:32,540
Made a choice

1314
00:22:32,540 --> 00:22:33,620
of his county.

1315
00:22:33,620 --> 00:22:34,440
But as he now.

1316
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:35,100
Was provided

1317
00:22:35,100 --> 00:22:35,880
with a good house

1318
00:22:35,880 --> 00:22:36,020
and the

1319
00:22:36,020 --> 00:22:37,220
liberty of a manor,

1320
00:22:37,220 --> 00:22:38,040
it was doubtful

1321
00:22:38,040 --> 00:22:38,760
to many of those

1322
00:22:38,760 --> 00:22:39,360
who best knew

1323
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:39,920
the easiness

1324
00:22:39,920 --> 00:22:40,860
of his temper,

1325
00:22:40,860 --> 00:22:41,240
whether he

1326
00:22:41,240 --> 00:22:42,080
might not spend

1327
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:42,620
the remainder

1328
00:22:42,620 --> 00:22:43,220
of his days

1329
00:22:43,220 --> 00:22:44,180
at Netherfield

1330
00:22:44,180 --> 00:22:44,640
and leave

1331
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:45,660
the next generation

1332
00:22:45,660 --> 00:22:46,740
to purchase.

1333
00:22:46,740 --> 00:22:48,020
His sisters were anxious

1334
00:22:48,020 --> 00:22:48,620
for his having

1335
00:22:48,620 --> 00:22:49,820
an estate of his own,

1336
00:22:49,880 --> 00:22:50,840
but there he was, now

1337
00:22:50,840 --> 00:22:51,680
only established

1338
00:22:51,680 --> 00:22:52,580
as a tenant.

1339
00:22:52,580 --> 00:22:53,240
Miss Bingley

1340
00:22:53,240 --> 00:22:54,020
was by no means

1341
00:22:54,020 --> 00:22:54,420
unwilling

1342
00:22:54,420 --> 00:22:55,640
to preside at his table.

1343
00:22:55,920 --> 00:22:56,700
Nor was Mrs.

1344
00:22:56,700 --> 00:22:57,320
Hurst,

1345
00:22:57,320 --> 00:22:57,920
who had married

1346
00:22:57,920 --> 00:22:59,180
a man of more fashion

1347
00:22:59,180 --> 00:23:00,540
than fortune, less

1348
00:23:00,540 --> 00:23:01,140
disposed to

1349
00:23:01,140 --> 00:23:01,920
consider his house

1350
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:02,400
as her home

1351
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:03,600
when it suited her.

1352
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:04,020
Mr.

1353
00:23:04,020 --> 00:23:04,860
Bingley had not

1354
00:23:04,860 --> 00:23:06,060
been of age to years

1355
00:23:06,120 --> 00:23:06,980
when he was tempted

1356
00:23:06,980 --> 00:23:07,260
by an

1357
00:23:07,260 --> 00:23:07,880
accidental

1358
00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:08,580
recommendation

1359
00:23:08,580 --> 00:23:09,020
to look at

1360
00:23:09,020 --> 00:23:10,220
Netherfield House.

1361
00:23:10,220 --> 00:23:11,600
He did look at it and.

1362
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:12,260
In to it for

1363
00:23:12,260 --> 00:23:13,140
half an hour

1364
00:23:13,140 --> 00:23:13,800
was pleased

1365
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:14,600
with the situation

1366
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:15,800
and the principal rooms,

1367
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:16,820
satisfied with what

1368
00:23:16,820 --> 00:23:17,460
the owner said

1369
00:23:17,460 --> 00:23:18,420
at its praise.

1370
00:23:18,420 --> 00:23:19,160
And took it.

1371
00:23:19,160 --> 00:23:20,360
Immediately.

1372
00:23:20,840 --> 00:23:22,340
Between him and Darcy,

1373
00:23:22,360 --> 00:23:22,940
there was a very

1374
00:23:22,940 --> 00:23:24,140
steady friendship,

1375
00:23:24,180 --> 00:23:24,680
in spite

1376
00:23:24,680 --> 00:23:25,640
of great opposition

1377
00:23:25,640 --> 00:23:26,780
of character.

1378
00:23:26,780 --> 00:23:27,800
Bingley was endeared

1379
00:23:27,800 --> 00:23:28,380
to Darcy

1380
00:23:28,380 --> 00:23:29,340
by the easiness.

1381
00:23:29,340 --> 00:23:30,200
Openness and.

1382
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:31,580
Ductility of his temper.

1383
00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:32,880
Though no disposition.

1384
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:33,360
Could offer

1385
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:34,420
a greater contrast

1386
00:23:34,420 --> 00:23:35,280
to his own.

1387
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:36,200
And though with his.

1388
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:36,540
Own, he

1389
00:23:36,540 --> 00:23:37,220
never appeared

1390
00:23:37,220 --> 00:23:38,420
dissatisfied.

1391
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:39,420
On the strength

1392
00:23:39,420 --> 00:23:40,620
of Darcy's regard.

1393
00:23:40,680 --> 00:23:41,360
Bingley had the

1394
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:42,560
firmest reliance

1395
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:43,880
and of his judgment,

1396
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:44,540
the highest.

1397
00:23:44,540 --> 00:23:45,720
Opinion in.

1398
00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:47,160
Understanding that Darcy

1399
00:23:47,160 --> 00:23:48,360
was the superior.

1400
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:49,140
Bingley was by

1401
00:23:49,140 --> 00:23:50,460
no means deficient, but

1402
00:23:50,460 --> 00:23:51,900
Darcy was clever.

1403
00:23:52,340 --> 00:23:53,520
He was at the same time

1404
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:54,860
haughty, reserved

1405
00:23:54,860 --> 00:23:56,040
and fastidious.

1406
00:23:56,040 --> 00:23:57,180
And his manners, though

1407
00:23:57,180 --> 00:23:57,860
well-bred,

1408
00:23:57,860 --> 00:23:59,220
were not inviting.

1409
00:23:59,700 --> 00:24:00,720
In that respect,

1410
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:01,820
his friend had greatly

1411
00:24:01,820 --> 00:24:02,960
the advantage.

1412
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:03,900
Bingley was sure of

1413
00:24:03,900 --> 00:24:04,460
being liked

1414
00:24:04,460 --> 00:24:05,660
wherever he appeared.

1415
00:24:05,660 --> 00:24:07,100
Darcy was continually

1416
00:24:07,100 --> 00:24:07,880
giving offense.

1417
00:24:09,060 --> 00:24:09,560
The manner

1418
00:24:09,560 --> 00:24:10,020
in which they

1419
00:24:10,020 --> 00:24:10,820
spoke of the merit

1420
00:24:10,820 --> 00:24:11,400
and assembly

1421
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:12,060
was sufficiently

1422
00:24:12,060 --> 00:24:13,220
characteristic.

1423
00:24:13,220 --> 00:24:14,340
Bingley had never met

1424
00:24:14,340 --> 00:24:14,640
with more

1425
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:15,380
pleasant people

1426
00:24:15,380 --> 00:24:16,140
or prettier girls

1427
00:24:16,140 --> 00:24:16,940
in his life.

1428
00:24:16,940 --> 00:24:17,700
Everybody had

1429
00:24:17,700 --> 00:24:18,660
been most kind

1430
00:24:18,660 --> 00:24:19,760
and attentive to him.

1431
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:20,160
There had been

1432
00:24:20,160 --> 00:24:21,180
no formality,

1433
00:24:21,180 --> 00:24:22,280
no stiffness.

1434
00:24:22,280 --> 00:24:22,880
He had soon.

1435
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:23,480
Felt acquainted

1436
00:24:23,480 --> 00:24:24,540
with all the room.

1437
00:24:24,540 --> 00:24:25,100
And asked him

1438
00:24:25,100 --> 00:24:25,860
as Bennett.

1439
00:24:25,860 --> 00:24:26,460
He could not

1440
00:24:26,460 --> 00:24:27,120
conceive an.

1441
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:28,460
Angel more beautiful.

1442
00:24:29,160 --> 00:24:29,820
Darcy,

1443
00:24:29,820 --> 00:24:31,020
on the contrary,

1444
00:24:31,040 --> 00:24:32,000
had seen a collection

1445
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:32,720
of people in whom

1446
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:33,680
there was little beauty

1447
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:34,880
and no fashion,

1448
00:24:34,920 --> 00:24:35,640
for none of whom

1449
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:36,020
he had felt

1450
00:24:36,020 --> 00:24:37,220
the smallest interest,

1451
00:24:37,380 --> 00:24:38,580
and from none received

1452
00:24:38,580 --> 00:24:39,420
either attention

1453
00:24:39,420 --> 00:24:40,620
or pleasure.

1454
00:24:40,740 --> 00:24:41,400
Miss Bennet.

1455
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:42,000
He acknowledged

1456
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,040
to be pretty.

1457
00:24:43,040 --> 00:24:44,720
But she smiled too

1458
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:45,920
much.

1459
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:46,440
Mrs.

1460
00:24:46,440 --> 00:24:46,800
Hurst

1461
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:47,360
and her sister

1462
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:48,560
allowed it to be so.

1463
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:49,260
But still

1464
00:24:49,260 --> 00:24:49,980
they admired her

1465
00:24:49,980 --> 00:24:50,760
and liked her

1466
00:24:50,760 --> 00:24:51,500
and pronounced her

1467
00:24:51,500 --> 00:24:52,920
to be a sweet girl and.

1468
00:24:52,920 --> 00:24:53,280
One to whom

1469
00:24:53,280 --> 00:24:54,120
they would not object to

1470
00:24:54,120 --> 00:24:55,100
no more of.

1471
00:24:55,100 --> 00:24:55,700
Miss Bennet

1472
00:24:55,700 --> 00:24:56,300
was therefore

1473
00:24:56,300 --> 00:24:56,940
established

1474
00:24:56,940 --> 00:24:58,140
as a sweet girl,

1475
00:24:58,140 --> 00:24:59,120
and their brother felt

1476
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:00,120
authorized by such.

1477
00:25:00,120 --> 00:25:01,440
Commendation to think.

1478
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:02,780
Of her as he chose.

1479
00:25:04,280 --> 00:25:05,480
Chapter five.

1480
00:25:06,780 --> 00:25:07,520
Within a short

1481
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:08,280
walk of long

1482
00:25:08,280 --> 00:25:09,320
born lived a family

1483
00:25:09,320 --> 00:25:10,140
with whom the Bennetts

1484
00:25:10,140 --> 00:25:10,940
were particularly

1485
00:25:10,940 --> 00:25:11,880
intimate.

1486
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:12,980
Sir William Lucas

1487
00:25:12,980 --> 00:25:13,760
had been formerly

1488
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:14,960
in trade in Meriton,

1489
00:25:15,180 --> 00:25:15,800
where he had made

1490
00:25:15,800 --> 00:25:17,000
a tolerable fortune

1491
00:25:17,180 --> 00:25:18,180
and risen to the honor

1492
00:25:18,180 --> 00:25:18,800
of knighthood

1493
00:25:18,800 --> 00:25:19,500
by an address

1494
00:25:19,500 --> 00:25:20,100
to the King

1495
00:25:20,100 --> 00:25:21,300
during his mayoralty.

1496
00:25:21,740 --> 00:25:22,680
The distinction had

1497
00:25:22,680 --> 00:25:23,660
perhaps been felt

1498
00:25:23,660 --> 00:25:24,860
too strongly.

1499
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:25,740
It had given him

1500
00:25:25,740 --> 00:25:26,420
a disgust

1501
00:25:26,420 --> 00:25:27,480
to his business.

1502
00:25:27,480 --> 00:25:27,680
And.

1503
00:25:27,680 --> 00:25:28,520
To his residents

1504
00:25:28,520 --> 00:25:29,820
in a small market town.

1505
00:25:30,120 --> 00:25:30,900
And in quitting them

1506
00:25:30,900 --> 00:25:31,460
both,

1507
00:25:31,460 --> 00:25:32,240
he had removed with.

1508
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:33,360
His family to a house

1509
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:33,980
about a mile

1510
00:25:33,980 --> 00:25:34,920
from Meriton.

1511
00:25:34,920 --> 00:25:36,020
Denominated from that

1512
00:25:36,020 --> 00:25:37,500
period, Lucas Lodge,

1513
00:25:37,740 --> 00:25:38,420
where he could think

1514
00:25:38,420 --> 00:25:39,000
with pleasure

1515
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:40,200
of his own importance.

1516
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:40,980
And unshackled

1517
00:25:40,980 --> 00:25:42,420
by business, occupied.

1518
00:25:42,420 --> 00:25:42,840
Himself

1519
00:25:42,840 --> 00:25:44,180
solely in being civil

1520
00:25:44,180 --> 00:25:45,380
to all the world.

1521
00:25:45,620 --> 00:25:46,500
Four, Though

1522
00:25:46,500 --> 00:25:47,700
elated by his rank.

1523
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:48,240
It did.

1524
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:49,020
Not render him

1525
00:25:49,020 --> 00:25:50,060
supercilious.

1526
00:25:50,060 --> 00:25:51,140
On the contrary,

1527
00:25:51,140 --> 00:25:52,340
he was all attention

1528
00:25:52,340 --> 00:25:53,480
to everybody.

1529
00:25:53,480 --> 00:25:53,760
By.

1530
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:54,980
Nature inoffensive,

1531
00:25:54,980 --> 00:25:56,280
friendly and obliging.

1532
00:25:56,520 --> 00:25:57,800
His presentation at St

1533
00:25:57,800 --> 00:25:58,440
James's had

1534
00:25:58,440 --> 00:25:59,640
made him courteous.

1535
00:26:00,120 --> 00:26:00,840
Lady Lucas

1536
00:26:00,840 --> 00:26:01,460
was a very good

1537
00:26:01,460 --> 00:26:02,360
kind of woman.

1538
00:26:02,360 --> 00:26:02,660
Not.

1539
00:26:02,660 --> 00:26:03,240
Too clever

1540
00:26:03,240 --> 00:26:03,540
to be a

1541
00:26:03,540 --> 00:26:04,280
valuable neighbor

1542
00:26:04,280 --> 00:26:05,300
to Mrs. Bennett.

1543
00:26:05,300 --> 00:26:05,700
They had

1544
00:26:05,700 --> 00:26:06,900
several children,

1545
00:26:06,920 --> 00:26:08,000
the eldest of them,

1546
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,200
a sensible, intelligent

1547
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:10,680
young woman, about 27,

1548
00:26:10,860 --> 00:26:11,660
was Elizabeth's

1549
00:26:11,660 --> 00:26:12,860
intimate friend.

1550
00:26:13,220 --> 00:26:14,420
That the Miss Lucas's.

1551
00:26:14,460 --> 00:26:15,200
And the Miss Bennet

1552
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:15,660
should meet.

1553
00:26:15,660 --> 00:26:16,340
To talk over

1554
00:26:16,340 --> 00:26:16,700
a ball

1555
00:26:16,700 --> 00:26:17,700
was absolutely

1556
00:26:17,700 --> 00:26:18,600
necessary.

1557
00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:19,160
And the morning

1558
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:20,000
after the assembly

1559
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:20,660
brought the former

1560
00:26:20,660 --> 00:26:21,860
to longboard to hear

1561
00:26:21,860 --> 00:26:23,060
and to communicate.

1562
00:26:23,660 --> 00:26:24,960
You began the evening.

1563
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:26,100
Well, Charlotte.

1564
00:26:26,100 --> 00:26:26,600
Said Mrs.

1565
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:27,660
Bennett with Civil South

1566
00:26:27,660 --> 00:26:28,320
Command to Ms..

1567
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:29,240
Lucas.

1568
00:26:29,240 --> 00:26:30,000
You were Mr.

1569
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:31,400
Begley's first choice.

1570
00:26:32,420 --> 00:26:33,360
Yes.

1571
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:34,380
But he seemed to like

1572
00:26:34,380 --> 00:26:35,580
his second better.

1573
00:26:36,140 --> 00:26:37,700
No, You mean Jane,

1574
00:26:37,700 --> 00:26:38,480
I suppose

1575
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:39,300
because he danced

1576
00:26:39,300 --> 00:26:40,380
with her twice,

1577
00:26:40,380 --> 00:26:41,720
to be sure that it did

1578
00:26:41,720 --> 00:26:42,260
seem as if he

1579
00:26:42,260 --> 00:26:43,260
admired her.

1580
00:26:43,260 --> 00:26:44,040
Indeed.

1581
00:26:44,040 --> 00:26:45,480
I rather believe he did.

1582
00:26:45,660 --> 00:26:46,260
I heard

1583
00:26:46,260 --> 00:26:47,460
something about it,

1584
00:26:47,660 --> 00:26:48,860
but I hardly know what.

1585
00:26:49,160 --> 00:26:50,220
Something about Mr.

1586
00:26:50,220 --> 00:26:51,420
Robinson.

1587
00:26:52,020 --> 00:26:53,520
Perhaps you mean what

1588
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:54,200
I overheard

1589
00:26:54,200 --> 00:26:55,100
between him and Mr.

1590
00:26:55,100 --> 00:26:56,000
Robinson.

1591
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:57,020
Did not I mention it

1592
00:26:57,020 --> 00:26:58,220
to you, Mr.

1593
00:26:58,220 --> 00:26:59,420
Robinson, asking him how

1594
00:26:59,420 --> 00:26:59,840
he liked

1595
00:26:59,840 --> 00:27:00,260
our marriage

1596
00:27:00,260 --> 00:27:01,200
and assemblies

1597
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:01,920
and whether he did

1598
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:02,420
not think

1599
00:27:02,420 --> 00:27:03,260
there were a great many

1600
00:27:03,260 --> 00:27:04,460
pretty women in the room

1601
00:27:04,460 --> 00:27:05,360
and which he thought

1602
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:06,260
the prettiest.

1603
00:27:06,260 --> 00:27:06,720
And his

1604
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:07,620
answering immediately

1605
00:27:07,620 --> 00:27:08,820
to the last question.

1606
00:27:09,060 --> 00:27:10,140
Oh, the eldest,

1607
00:27:10,140 --> 00:27:10,920
Miss Bennett,

1608
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:11,960
beyond a doubt.

1609
00:27:11,960 --> 00:27:12,800
That cannot be

1610
00:27:12,800 --> 00:27:13,500
to opinions

1611
00:27:13,500 --> 00:27:14,700
on that point.

1612
00:27:15,060 --> 00:27:16,620
Upon my word.

1613
00:27:17,040 --> 00:27:17,280
Well,

1614
00:27:17,280 --> 00:27:18,860
that is very decided

1615
00:27:18,860 --> 00:27:19,800
indeed.

1616
00:27:19,800 --> 00:27:21,000
That does seem as if.

1617
00:27:21,780 --> 00:27:22,460
But however

1618
00:27:22,460 --> 00:27:23,000
it may all

1619
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:23,640
come to nothing,

1620
00:27:23,640 --> 00:27:24,840
you know.

1621
00:27:25,080 --> 00:27:26,060
My of the hearings

1622
00:27:26,060 --> 00:27:26,940
are more to the purpose

1623
00:27:26,940 --> 00:27:27,500
than yours.

1624
00:27:27,500 --> 00:27:28,440
Eliza.

1625
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:29,640
Said Charlotte.

1626
00:27:29,640 --> 00:27:30,020
Mr.

1627
00:27:30,020 --> 00:27:31,160
Darcy is not so well

1628
00:27:31,160 --> 00:27:32,100
worth listening to

1629
00:27:32,100 --> 00:27:33,300
as his friend, is he?

1630
00:27:33,560 --> 00:27:34,760
For Eliza

1631
00:27:34,760 --> 00:27:35,820
to be only just

1632
00:27:35,820 --> 00:27:37,020
tolerable.

1633
00:27:37,500 --> 00:27:38,360
I beg

1634
00:27:38,360 --> 00:27:39,480
you, would not put into

1635
00:27:39,480 --> 00:27:40,020
Lizzie's head

1636
00:27:40,020 --> 00:27:40,620
to be vexed

1637
00:27:40,620 --> 00:27:41,820
by his ill treatment,

1638
00:27:41,880 --> 00:27:42,240
for he is

1639
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:43,620
such a disagreeable man

1640
00:27:43,820 --> 00:27:44,280
that it would be

1641
00:27:44,280 --> 00:27:45,320
a quite a misfortune

1642
00:27:45,320 --> 00:27:46,520
to be liked by him.

1643
00:27:46,740 --> 00:27:47,240
Mrs.

1644
00:27:47,240 --> 00:27:48,540
Long told me last night

1645
00:27:48,540 --> 00:27:49,580
that he sat close to her

1646
00:27:49,580 --> 00:27:51,000
for half an hour without

1647
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:52,560
once opening his lips.

1648
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:54,560
He's quite sure

1649
00:27:54,560 --> 00:27:55,820
Mum is not

1650
00:27:55,820 --> 00:27:57,020
there a little mistake?

1651
00:27:57,320 --> 00:27:58,460
Said Jane.

1652
00:27:58,460 --> 00:27:59,700
I certainly saw Mr.

1653
00:27:59,700 --> 00:28:01,040
Darcy speaking to her.

1654
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:03,480
I because she asked him

1655
00:28:03,480 --> 00:28:04,780
at last how he liked

1656
00:28:04,820 --> 00:28:05,600
know the field

1657
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:06,140
and he could not

1658
00:28:06,140 --> 00:28:07,340
help answering her.

1659
00:28:07,560 --> 00:28:08,220
But she said

1660
00:28:08,220 --> 00:28:09,840
he seemed quite angry

1661
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:11,040
at being spoken to.

1662
00:28:11,900 --> 00:28:13,280
Miss Bingley told me,

1663
00:28:13,560 --> 00:28:14,540
said Jane,

1664
00:28:14,540 --> 00:28:15,020
that he never

1665
00:28:15,020 --> 00:28:16,460
speaks much unless

1666
00:28:16,460 --> 00:28:16,820
among his

1667
00:28:16,820 --> 00:28:18,020
intimate acquaintances

1668
00:28:18,260 --> 00:28:18,840
with them

1669
00:28:18,840 --> 00:28:19,080
he is

1670
00:28:19,080 --> 00:28:20,280
remarkably agreeable.

1671
00:28:20,900 --> 00:28:21,680
No, I do not believe

1672
00:28:21,680 --> 00:28:22,160
a word of.

1673
00:28:22,160 --> 00:28:23,000
It's my dear.

1674
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:23,840
If he had been

1675
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:25,400
so very agreeable,

1676
00:28:25,460 --> 00:28:25,940
he would have

1677
00:28:25,940 --> 00:28:26,660
talked to Mrs.

1678
00:28:26,660 --> 00:28:27,540
Long.

1679
00:28:27,540 --> 00:28:28,640
But I can guess

1680
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:29,460
how it was.

1681
00:28:29,460 --> 00:28:30,600
Everybody says that

1682
00:28:30,600 --> 00:28:31,940
he is at up with pride.

1683
00:28:32,120 --> 00:28:33,240
And I daresay he'd

1684
00:28:33,240 --> 00:28:34,460
heard somehow that Mrs.

1685
00:28:34,460 --> 00:28:35,040
Long was not to

1686
00:28:35,040 --> 00:28:35,840
keep a carriage

1687
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:36,600
and had come to the

1688
00:28:36,600 --> 00:28:37,920
ball in a chaise.

1689
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:39,800
I do not mind.

1690
00:28:39,800 --> 00:28:40,820
Is not talking to Mrs.

1691
00:28:40,820 --> 00:28:42,360
Long, said Miss Lucas.

1692
00:28:42,620 --> 00:28:43,140
But I wish

1693
00:28:43,140 --> 00:28:43,760
she had danced

1694
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:44,960
with Eliza.

1695
00:28:45,240 --> 00:28:46,740
Another time, Lizzie.

1696
00:28:47,040 --> 00:28:48,120
Said her mother.

1697
00:28:48,120 --> 00:28:49,160
I would not dance

1698
00:28:49,160 --> 00:28:50,580
with him if I were you.

1699
00:28:51,260 --> 00:28:51,960
I believe,

1700
00:28:51,960 --> 00:28:52,280
ma'am,

1701
00:28:52,280 --> 00:28:53,460
I may safely promise

1702
00:28:53,460 --> 00:28:54,600
you never to dance

1703
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:55,800
with him.

1704
00:28:55,980 --> 00:28:57,180
His pride,

1705
00:28:57,200 --> 00:28:58,400
said, Miss Lucas,

1706
00:28:58,620 --> 00:28:59,720
does not offend me

1707
00:28:59,720 --> 00:29:00,200
so much

1708
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:01,440
as pride often does,

1709
00:29:01,680 --> 00:29:02,240
because there

1710
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:03,440
is an excuse for it.

1711
00:29:03,780 --> 00:29:04,940
One cannot wonder that.

1712
00:29:04,940 --> 00:29:05,700
So very fine.

1713
00:29:05,700 --> 00:29:06,500
A young man

1714
00:29:06,500 --> 00:29:07,980
with family fortune.

1715
00:29:08,100 --> 00:29:09,420
Everything in his favor

1716
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:10,080
should think

1717
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:11,280
very highly of himself.

1718
00:29:11,700 --> 00:29:13,040
If I may so express it.

1719
00:29:13,280 --> 00:29:14,060
He has a right

1720
00:29:14,060 --> 00:29:15,260
to be proud.

1721
00:29:15,680 --> 00:29:17,060
And that is very true.

1722
00:29:17,340 --> 00:29:18,540
Replied Elizabeth.

1723
00:29:18,600 --> 00:29:19,640
And I could easily

1724
00:29:19,640 --> 00:29:20,880
forgive his pride

1725
00:29:21,080 --> 00:29:21,960
if he had not

1726
00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:23,300
mortified mine.

1727
00:29:24,620 --> 00:29:25,620
Pride.

1728
00:29:25,620 --> 00:29:26,600
Observed Mary,

1729
00:29:26,600 --> 00:29:27,780
who peeked herself upon

1730
00:29:27,780 --> 00:29:28,320
the solidity

1731
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:29,520
of her reflections.

1732
00:29:29,660 --> 00:29:30,720
Is a very common

1733
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:31,920
fanning, I believe,

1734
00:29:32,060 --> 00:29:32,780
by all that

1735
00:29:32,780 --> 00:29:33,720
I have ever read.

1736
00:29:33,720 --> 00:29:34,800
I am convinced that

1737
00:29:34,800 --> 00:29:36,200
it is very common indeed

1738
00:29:36,540 --> 00:29:37,580
that human nature

1739
00:29:37,580 --> 00:29:38,400
is particularly

1740
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:39,360
prone to it,

1741
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:40,380
and that there are very

1742
00:29:40,380 --> 00:29:40,920
few of us

1743
00:29:40,920 --> 00:29:41,820
who do not cherish

1744
00:29:41,820 --> 00:29:42,240
a feeling

1745
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:43,380
of self complacency

1746
00:29:43,380 --> 00:29:43,880
on the score

1747
00:29:43,880 --> 00:29:44,720
of some quality

1748
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:45,360
or other,

1749
00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:46,740
real or imaginary.

1750
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:48,300
Vanity and pride

1751
00:29:48,300 --> 00:29:49,340
are different things,

1752
00:29:49,340 --> 00:29:49,520
though

1753
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:50,680
the words are often used

1754
00:29:50,680 --> 00:29:51,740
anonymously.

1755
00:29:51,740 --> 00:29:53,160
A person may be proud

1756
00:29:53,160 --> 00:29:54,360
without being vain.

1757
00:29:54,600 --> 00:29:55,400
Pride relates

1758
00:29:55,400 --> 00:29:56,280
more to our opinion

1759
00:29:56,280 --> 00:29:57,200
of ourselves.

1760
00:29:57,200 --> 00:29:57,800
Vanity

1761
00:29:57,800 --> 00:29:58,220
to what

1762
00:29:58,220 --> 00:29:58,980
we would have others

1763
00:29:58,980 --> 00:30:00,180
think of us.

1764
00:30:00,260 --> 00:30:01,460
If I were as rich as Mr.

1765
00:30:01,460 --> 00:30:02,480
Darcy.

1766
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:03,480
Cried a young Lucas

1767
00:30:03,480 --> 00:30:03,920
who came with

1768
00:30:03,920 --> 00:30:05,120
his sisters.

1769
00:30:05,160 --> 00:30:05,880
I should not care

1770
00:30:05,880 --> 00:30:07,080
how proud I was.

1771
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:07,980
I would keep a pack

1772
00:30:07,980 --> 00:30:08,640
of fox hounds

1773
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:09,020
and drink a

1774
00:30:09,020 --> 00:30:09,660
bottle of wine

1775
00:30:09,660 --> 00:30:10,280
every day.

1776
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:12,660
Then you would drink

1777
00:30:12,660 --> 00:30:13,140
a great

1778
00:30:13,140 --> 00:30:13,940
deal more than you

1779
00:30:13,940 --> 00:30:15,080
ought, said Mrs.

1780
00:30:15,080 --> 00:30:15,860
Bennet.

1781
00:30:15,860 --> 00:30:16,880
And if I were to see you

1782
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:17,460
at it,

1783
00:30:17,460 --> 00:30:18,480
I should take away

1784
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:19,980
your bottle directly.

1785
00:30:20,760 --> 00:30:21,800
The boy protested

1786
00:30:21,800 --> 00:30:22,920
that she should not.

1787
00:30:22,920 --> 00:30:23,580
She continued.

1788
00:30:23,580 --> 00:30:24,360
To declare that she.

1789
00:30:24,360 --> 00:30:24,980
Would.

1790
00:30:24,980 --> 00:30:25,880
And the argument

1791
00:30:25,880 --> 00:30:26,720
ended only

1792
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:27,920
with the visit.

1793
00:30:30,500 --> 00:30:31,700
Chapter six.

1794
00:30:33,140 --> 00:30:34,140
The ladies of Long

1795
00:30:34,140 --> 00:30:34,700
Borne soon

1796
00:30:34,700 --> 00:30:35,180
waited on

1797
00:30:35,180 --> 00:30:36,380
those of Netherfield.

1798
00:30:36,540 --> 00:30:37,380
The visit was soon

1799
00:30:37,380 --> 00:30:38,840
returned in due form.

1800
00:30:39,240 --> 00:30:39,980
Miss Bennet's

1801
00:30:39,980 --> 00:30:40,920
pleasing manners

1802
00:30:40,920 --> 00:30:41,840
grew on the goodwill

1803
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:42,240
of Mrs.

1804
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:43,500
Hurst and Miss Bingley.

1805
00:30:43,940 --> 00:30:44,340
And though

1806
00:30:44,340 --> 00:30:45,320
the mother was found

1807
00:30:45,320 --> 00:30:46,560
to be intolerable

1808
00:30:46,740 --> 00:30:47,660
and the younger sister

1809
00:30:47,660 --> 00:30:48,200
is not worth

1810
00:30:48,200 --> 00:30:49,320
speaking to.

1811
00:30:49,320 --> 00:30:49,760
A wish.

1812
00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:50,420
Of being better

1813
00:30:50,420 --> 00:30:51,020
acquainted with

1814
00:30:51,020 --> 00:30:52,100
than was expressed

1815
00:30:52,100 --> 00:30:53,460
towards the two eldest.

1816
00:30:53,960 --> 00:30:54,620
By. Jane.

1817
00:30:54,620 --> 00:30:55,200
This attention

1818
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:55,740
was received

1819
00:30:55,740 --> 00:30:55,920
with the

1820
00:30:55,920 --> 00:30:57,120
greatest pleasure.

1821
00:30:57,140 --> 00:30:58,200
But Elizabeth still

1822
00:30:58,200 --> 00:30:59,460
saw supercilious ness

1823
00:30:59,460 --> 00:31:00,140
in their treatment

1824
00:31:00,140 --> 00:31:01,560
of everybody, hardly

1825
00:31:01,560 --> 00:31:02,120
excepting

1826
00:31:02,120 --> 00:31:03,240
even her sister,

1827
00:31:03,240 --> 00:31:04,640
and could not like them.

1828
00:31:05,180 --> 00:31:05,480
Though

1829
00:31:05,480 --> 00:31:06,800
their kindness to Jane,

1830
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:08,160
such as it was,

1831
00:31:08,180 --> 00:31:09,660
had a value as arising

1832
00:31:09,660 --> 00:31:10,640
in all probability

1833
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:11,400
from the influence

1834
00:31:11,400 --> 00:31:12,080
of their brother's

1835
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:13,280
admiration.

1836
00:31:13,560 --> 00:31:14,880
It was generally evident

1837
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:15,920
whenever they met

1838
00:31:15,920 --> 00:31:17,300
that he did admire her,

1839
00:31:17,520 --> 00:31:18,260
and to her

1840
00:31:18,260 --> 00:31:19,340
it was equally evident

1841
00:31:19,340 --> 00:31:20,460
that Jane was yielding

1842
00:31:20,460 --> 00:31:21,420
to the preference

1843
00:31:21,420 --> 00:31:22,220
which she had begun

1844
00:31:22,220 --> 00:31:23,160
to entertain for him

1845
00:31:23,160 --> 00:31:24,140
from the first

1846
00:31:24,140 --> 00:31:25,080
and was in a way

1847
00:31:25,080 --> 00:31:26,400
to be very much in love.

1848
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:27,900
But she considered with

1849
00:31:27,900 --> 00:31:28,260
pleasure

1850
00:31:28,260 --> 00:31:29,160
that it was not likely

1851
00:31:29,160 --> 00:31:29,760
to be discovered

1852
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:30,960
by the world in general.

1853
00:31:31,100 --> 00:31:32,460
Since Jane united

1854
00:31:32,600 --> 00:31:33,480
with great strength

1855
00:31:33,480 --> 00:31:34,920
of feeling a composure

1856
00:31:34,920 --> 00:31:36,240
of temper and a uniform

1857
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:37,440
cheerfulness of manner

1858
00:31:37,460 --> 00:31:38,280
which would guard her

1859
00:31:38,280 --> 00:31:39,140
from the suspicions

1860
00:31:39,140 --> 00:31:40,340
of the impertinent.

1861
00:31:40,460 --> 00:31:41,420
She mentioned this

1862
00:31:41,420 --> 00:31:42,000
to her friend,

1863
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:43,200
Miss Lucas.

1864
00:31:43,260 --> 00:31:44,400
It may perhaps

1865
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:45,500
be pleasant,

1866
00:31:45,500 --> 00:31:46,700
replied Charlotte.

1867
00:31:46,940 --> 00:31:47,580
To be able

1868
00:31:47,580 --> 00:31:48,800
to impose on the public.

1869
00:31:48,800 --> 00:31:50,000
In such a case.

1870
00:31:50,060 --> 00:31:50,660
But it is

1871
00:31:50,660 --> 00:31:52,100
sometimes a disadvantage

1872
00:31:52,100 --> 00:31:53,460
to be so very guarded.

1873
00:31:53,900 --> 00:31:55,160
If a woman conceals

1874
00:31:55,160 --> 00:31:55,800
her affection.

1875
00:31:55,800 --> 00:31:56,300
With the same

1876
00:31:56,300 --> 00:31:57,000
skill from the.

1877
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:58,100
Object of it,

1878
00:31:58,100 --> 00:31:59,000
she may lose the

1879
00:31:59,000 --> 00:31:59,720
opportunity of

1880
00:31:59,720 --> 00:32:00,840
fixing him.

1881
00:32:00,840 --> 00:32:01,760
And it will then

1882
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:03,320
be that poor consolation

1883
00:32:03,320 --> 00:32:04,220
to believe the world

1884
00:32:04,220 --> 00:32:05,420
equally in the dark.

1885
00:32:05,900 --> 00:32:06,860
There is so much of.

1886
00:32:06,860 --> 00:32:08,280
Gratitude or vanity.

1887
00:32:08,280 --> 00:32:08,840
In almost

1888
00:32:08,840 --> 00:32:10,040
every attachment

1889
00:32:10,100 --> 00:32:11,160
that it is not safe.

1890
00:32:11,160 --> 00:32:12,000
To leave any to.

1891
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:13,080
Itself.

1892
00:32:13,080 --> 00:32:14,780
We can all begin freely

1893
00:32:15,020 --> 00:32:16,200
a slight preference

1894
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:17,400
is natural enough,

1895
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:18,260
but there are very

1896
00:32:18,260 --> 00:32:18,860
few of us

1897
00:32:18,860 --> 00:32:19,640
who are part enough

1898
00:32:19,640 --> 00:32:20,540
to be really in love

1899
00:32:20,540 --> 00:32:21,740
without encouragement.

1900
00:32:22,040 --> 00:32:23,120
In nine cases

1901
00:32:23,120 --> 00:32:23,760
out of ten.

1902
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:24,720
A woman had better show.

1903
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:25,500
More affection

1904
00:32:25,500 --> 00:32:26,700
than she feels.

1905
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:27,860
Bingley likes

1906
00:32:27,860 --> 00:32:28,400
your sister,

1907
00:32:28,400 --> 00:32:29,600
undoubtedly,

1908
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:30,480
but he may never

1909
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:31,680
do more than like her

1910
00:32:31,820 --> 00:32:32,720
if she does not

1911
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:33,920
help him on

1912
00:32:34,380 --> 00:32:35,120
and that she does

1913
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:35,900
help him on

1914
00:32:35,900 --> 00:32:36,900
as much as the nature

1915
00:32:36,900 --> 00:32:37,880
will allow.

1916
00:32:37,880 --> 00:32:39,020
If I can perceive her

1917
00:32:39,020 --> 00:32:39,980
regard for him,

1918
00:32:39,980 --> 00:32:41,280
he must be a simpleton

1919
00:32:41,280 --> 00:32:41,960
indeed not to

1920
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:43,100
discover it. To

1921
00:32:44,120 --> 00:32:45,320
remember Eliza,

1922
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:46,740
that he does not know

1923
00:32:46,740 --> 00:32:47,760
Jane's disposition

1924
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:48,960
as you do.

1925
00:32:49,380 --> 00:32:50,100
But if a woman

1926
00:32:50,100 --> 00:32:51,300
is partial to a man

1927
00:32:51,480 --> 00:32:51,780
and does

1928
00:32:51,780 --> 00:32:52,280
not endeavor

1929
00:32:52,280 --> 00:32:53,180
to conceal it,

1930
00:32:53,180 --> 00:32:54,540
he must find it out.

1931
00:32:55,560 --> 00:32:56,760
Perhaps he must,

1932
00:32:56,840 --> 00:32:57,480
if he sees

1933
00:32:57,480 --> 00:32:58,680
enough of her.

1934
00:32:58,700 --> 00:33:00,000
But there being the end,

1935
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:00,560
Jane, meet

1936
00:33:00,560 --> 00:33:01,760
tolerably often.

1937
00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:02,420
It has never for.

1938
00:33:02,420 --> 00:33:03,620
Many hours together.

1939
00:33:03,860 --> 00:33:04,760
And as they always

1940
00:33:04,760 --> 00:33:05,840
see each other in large

1941
00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:07,040
mixed parties,

1942
00:33:07,100 --> 00:33:08,100
it is impossible

1943
00:33:08,100 --> 00:33:08,820
that every moment

1944
00:33:08,820 --> 00:33:09,480
should be employed

1945
00:33:09,480 --> 00:33:10,680
in conversing together.

1946
00:33:11,300 --> 00:33:12,360
Jane should therefore

1947
00:33:12,360 --> 00:33:12,660
make the

1948
00:33:12,660 --> 00:33:13,860
most of every half hour

1949
00:33:13,860 --> 00:33:14,160
in which

1950
00:33:14,160 --> 00:33:14,820
he can command

1951
00:33:14,820 --> 00:33:15,960
his attention

1952
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:16,620
when she is

1953
00:33:16,620 --> 00:33:17,600
secure of him.

1954
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:18,020
There should be

1955
00:33:18,020 --> 00:33:18,660
more leisure

1956
00:33:18,660 --> 00:33:19,500
for falling in love

1957
00:33:19,500 --> 00:33:20,700
as much as she chooses.

1958
00:33:21,660 --> 00:33:23,060
New plan is a good one,

1959
00:33:23,420 --> 00:33:24,620
said Elizabeth.

1960
00:33:24,620 --> 00:33:24,920
Where

1961
00:33:24,920 --> 00:33:25,920
nothing is in question

1962
00:33:25,920 --> 00:33:26,160
but the.

1963
00:33:26,160 --> 00:33:27,140
Desire of being, well.

1964
00:33:27,140 --> 00:33:28,100
Married.

1965
00:33:28,100 --> 00:33:29,160
And if I were determined

1966
00:33:29,160 --> 00:33:30,260
to get a rich husband

1967
00:33:30,260 --> 00:33:31,460
or any husband,

1968
00:33:31,520 --> 00:33:32,220
I daresay

1969
00:33:32,220 --> 00:33:33,420
I should adopt it.

1970
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:34,560
But these are not

1971
00:33:34,560 --> 00:33:35,760
Jane's feelings.

1972
00:33:35,960 --> 00:33:37,040
She is not acting

1973
00:33:37,040 --> 00:33:38,240
by design.

1974
00:33:38,400 --> 00:33:39,060
As yet,

1975
00:33:39,060 --> 00:33:39,540
she can not

1976
00:33:39,540 --> 00:33:40,260
even be certain

1977
00:33:40,260 --> 00:33:40,680
of the degree

1978
00:33:40,680 --> 00:33:42,020
of her own regard, nor

1979
00:33:42,020 --> 00:33:43,220
of its reasonableness.

1980
00:33:43,560 --> 00:33:44,360
She has known him

1981
00:33:44,360 --> 00:33:45,560
only a fortnight.

1982
00:33:45,740 --> 00:33:47,120
She danced for dances

1983
00:33:47,120 --> 00:33:48,200
with him at Maritain.

1984
00:33:48,200 --> 00:33:49,280
She saw him one morning

1985
00:33:49,280 --> 00:33:50,240
at his own house

1986
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:51,180
and has since dined

1987
00:33:51,180 --> 00:33:51,900
with him in company

1988
00:33:51,900 --> 00:33:53,100
four times.

1989
00:33:53,300 --> 00:33:54,500
This is not quite enough

1990
00:33:54,500 --> 00:33:55,440
to make her understand

1991
00:33:55,440 --> 00:33:56,640
his character,

1992
00:33:56,700 --> 00:33:58,440
not as you represent it.

1993
00:33:58,980 --> 00:33:59,540
Had she

1994
00:33:59,540 --> 00:34:00,840
merely dined with him,

1995
00:34:01,080 --> 00:34:01,560
she might.

1996
00:34:01,560 --> 00:34:02,460
Only have discovered

1997
00:34:02,460 --> 00:34:03,080
whether he had a good.

1998
00:34:03,080 --> 00:34:04,200
Appetite.

1999
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:05,120
But you must remember

2000
00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:06,120
that four evenings

2001
00:34:06,120 --> 00:34:06,600
have also

2002
00:34:06,600 --> 00:34:07,800
been spent together

2003
00:34:07,860 --> 00:34:08,820
and for evenings.

2004
00:34:08,820 --> 00:34:09,480
May do a great.

2005
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:10,680
Deal.

2006
00:34:10,760 --> 00:34:12,740
Yes, these four evenings

2007
00:34:12,740 --> 00:34:12,840
have.

2008
00:34:12,840 --> 00:34:13,380
Enabled them

2009
00:34:13,380 --> 00:34:14,040
to ascertain

2010
00:34:14,040 --> 00:34:14,780
that they both like

2011
00:34:14,780 --> 00:34:15,500
Van Taylor

2012
00:34:15,500 --> 00:34:16,700
better than Commerce.

2013
00:34:16,820 --> 00:34:17,580
But with respect.

2014
00:34:17,580 --> 00:34:18,540
To any other leading.

2015
00:34:18,540 --> 00:34:19,320
Characteristic,

2016
00:34:19,320 --> 00:34:20,300
I do not imagine that

2017
00:34:20,300 --> 00:34:21,680
much has been unfolded.

2018
00:34:22,700 --> 00:34:24,440
Well said, Charlotte.

2019
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:25,520
I wish

2020
00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:26,580
Jane success with.

2021
00:34:26,580 --> 00:34:27,640
All my heart.

2022
00:34:27,640 --> 00:34:28,580
And if she were married

2023
00:34:28,580 --> 00:34:29,540
to him tomorrow,

2024
00:34:29,540 --> 00:34:30,000
I should.

2025
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:31,320
Think she had as good

2026
00:34:31,320 --> 00:34:31,880
a chance of.

2027
00:34:31,880 --> 00:34:32,600
Happiness

2028
00:34:32,600 --> 00:34:33,260
as if she were

2029
00:34:33,260 --> 00:34:33,980
to be studying

2030
00:34:33,980 --> 00:34:34,580
his character

2031
00:34:34,580 --> 00:34:35,780
for a 12 month.

2032
00:34:36,200 --> 00:34:37,180
Happiness in marriage

2033
00:34:37,180 --> 00:34:37,800
is entirely

2034
00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:39,000
a matter of chance.

2035
00:34:39,140 --> 00:34:40,120
If the dispositions

2036
00:34:40,120 --> 00:34:41,040
of the parties are ever

2037
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:41,460
so well

2038
00:34:41,460 --> 00:34:42,600
known to each other

2039
00:34:42,600 --> 00:34:43,500
or ever so similar

2040
00:34:43,500 --> 00:34:44,540
beforehand,

2041
00:34:44,540 --> 00:34:45,700
it does not advance

2042
00:34:45,700 --> 00:34:46,400
their felicity

2043
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:47,600
in the least.

2044
00:34:47,680 --> 00:34:48,840
They always continue

2045
00:34:48,840 --> 00:34:49,800
to grow sufficiently

2046
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:51,000
unlike afterwards

2047
00:34:51,020 --> 00:34:51,560
to have their

2048
00:34:51,560 --> 00:34:52,760
share of vexation.

2049
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:53,820
And it is better to.

2050
00:34:53,820 --> 00:34:54,380
Know as little

2051
00:34:54,380 --> 00:34:55,120
as possible of the.

2052
00:34:55,120 --> 00:34:56,140
Defects of the person

2053
00:34:56,140 --> 00:34:56,480
with whom

2054
00:34:56,480 --> 00:34:57,080
you ought to cast

2055
00:34:57,080 --> 00:34:58,280
your life.

2056
00:34:58,720 --> 00:34:59,420
You make me

2057
00:34:59,420 --> 00:35:00,620
laugh, Charlotte.

2058
00:35:00,980 --> 00:35:02,340
But it is not sound.

2059
00:35:02,620 --> 00:35:03,060
You know

2060
00:35:03,060 --> 00:35:04,260
it is not sound.

2061
00:35:04,460 --> 00:35:05,520
And that you would never

2062
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:06,020
act in this

2063
00:35:06,020 --> 00:35:06,980
way yourself.

2064
00:35:08,100 --> 00:35:08,940
Occupied in

2065
00:35:08,940 --> 00:35:09,640
observing Mr.

2066
00:35:09,640 --> 00:35:10,560
Bigley's attentions

2067
00:35:10,560 --> 00:35:11,620
to her sister.

2068
00:35:11,620 --> 00:35:12,800
Elizabeth was far from

2069
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:13,440
suspecting

2070
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:14,400
that she was herself

2071
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:15,320
becoming an object

2072
00:35:15,320 --> 00:35:16,380
of some interest

2073
00:35:16,380 --> 00:35:17,040
in the eyes

2074
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:18,240
of his friend.

2075
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:18,680
Mr.

2076
00:35:18,680 --> 00:35:19,520
Darcy had at

2077
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:20,480
first scarcely

2078
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:20,940
allowed her

2079
00:35:20,940 --> 00:35:21,920
to be pretty.

2080
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:22,820
He had looked at her

2081
00:35:22,820 --> 00:35:23,660
without admiration

2082
00:35:23,660 --> 00:35:24,560
and at the ball.

2083
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:25,760
And when they next met,

2084
00:35:25,940 --> 00:35:26,720
he looked at her

2085
00:35:26,720 --> 00:35:27,920
only to criticize.

2086
00:35:28,340 --> 00:35:29,400
But no sooner had

2087
00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:29,780
he made it

2088
00:35:29,780 --> 00:35:30,680
clear to himself

2089
00:35:30,680 --> 00:35:31,320
and his friends

2090
00:35:31,320 --> 00:35:31,980
that she hardly

2091
00:35:31,980 --> 00:35:32,760
had a good feature

2092
00:35:32,760 --> 00:35:33,740
in her face.

2093
00:35:33,740 --> 00:35:34,760
Then he began to find

2094
00:35:34,760 --> 00:35:35,300
it was rendered

2095
00:35:35,300 --> 00:35:36,640
uncommonly intelligent

2096
00:35:36,900 --> 00:35:37,160
by the

2097
00:35:37,160 --> 00:35:38,120
beautiful expression

2098
00:35:38,120 --> 00:35:39,320
of her dark eyes.

2099
00:35:39,620 --> 00:35:40,620
To this discovery

2100
00:35:40,620 --> 00:35:41,120
succeeded

2101
00:35:41,120 --> 00:35:41,780
some others

2102
00:35:41,780 --> 00:35:42,980
equally mortifying.

2103
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:44,460
Though he had detected

2104
00:35:44,460 --> 00:35:45,320
with a critical eye

2105
00:35:45,320 --> 00:35:46,260
more than one failure

2106
00:35:46,260 --> 00:35:46,760
of perfect

2107
00:35:46,760 --> 00:35:47,960
symmetry in her form.

2108
00:35:48,200 --> 00:35:48,840
He was forced

2109
00:35:48,840 --> 00:35:49,560
to acknowledge her

2110
00:35:49,560 --> 00:35:50,140
figure to be

2111
00:35:50,140 --> 00:35:51,360
light and pleasing,

2112
00:35:51,640 --> 00:35:52,560
and in spite of his

2113
00:35:52,560 --> 00:35:53,100
asserting that

2114
00:35:53,100 --> 00:35:53,580
her manners

2115
00:35:53,580 --> 00:35:54,260
were not those

2116
00:35:54,260 --> 00:35:54,440
of the

2117
00:35:54,440 --> 00:35:55,640
fashionable world.

2118
00:35:55,700 --> 00:35:56,520
He was caught

2119
00:35:56,520 --> 00:35:57,320
by their easy

2120
00:35:57,320 --> 00:35:58,520
playfulness.

2121
00:35:58,700 --> 00:35:59,360
Of this,

2122
00:35:59,360 --> 00:35:59,680
she was

2123
00:35:59,680 --> 00:36:00,900
perfectly unaware.

2124
00:36:00,920 --> 00:36:01,460
To her,

2125
00:36:01,460 --> 00:36:02,300
he was only the man

2126
00:36:02,300 --> 00:36:02,580
who made

2127
00:36:02,580 --> 00:36:03,360
himself agreeable

2128
00:36:03,360 --> 00:36:04,080
nowhere

2129
00:36:04,080 --> 00:36:04,880
and who had not thought

2130
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:05,660
her handsome enough

2131
00:36:05,660 --> 00:36:06,860
to dance with.

2132
00:36:07,220 --> 00:36:08,100
He began to wish

2133
00:36:08,100 --> 00:36:08,400
to know.

2134
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:09,260
More of her

2135
00:36:09,260 --> 00:36:10,440
and as a step towards

2136
00:36:10,440 --> 00:36:10,980
conversing

2137
00:36:10,980 --> 00:36:11,960
with her himself,

2138
00:36:11,960 --> 00:36:12,480
attended to

2139
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:13,320
her conversation

2140
00:36:13,320 --> 00:36:14,360
with others.

2141
00:36:14,360 --> 00:36:15,260
His doing so

2142
00:36:15,260 --> 00:36:16,460
drew her notice.

2143
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:17,300
It was at Sir

2144
00:36:17,300 --> 00:36:18,620
William Lucas's where a

2145
00:36:18,620 --> 00:36:19,380
large party

2146
00:36:19,380 --> 00:36:20,100
were assembled.

2147
00:36:21,200 --> 00:36:22,020
What does Mr.

2148
00:36:22,020 --> 00:36:23,220
Darcy mean?

2149
00:36:23,360 --> 00:36:23,880
Said she.

2150
00:36:23,880 --> 00:36:24,960
To Charlotte.

2151
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:25,660
By listening

2152
00:36:25,660 --> 00:36:26,520
to my conversation

2153
00:36:26,520 --> 00:36:27,720
with Colonel Foster.

2154
00:36:28,520 --> 00:36:29,300
That is a question

2155
00:36:29,300 --> 00:36:29,900
which only Mr.

2156
00:36:29,900 --> 00:36:31,100
Darcy can answer.

2157
00:36:31,880 --> 00:36:32,620
But if he does it

2158
00:36:32,620 --> 00:36:33,160
any more,

2159
00:36:33,160 --> 00:36:33,800
I shall certainly

2160
00:36:33,800 --> 00:36:34,400
let him know that

2161
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:35,600
I see what he is about.

2162
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:36,680
He has a very

2163
00:36:36,680 --> 00:36:37,860
satirical eye.

2164
00:36:37,860 --> 00:36:38,520
And if I do not

2165
00:36:38,520 --> 00:36:39,020
begin by.

2166
00:36:39,020 --> 00:36:39,260
Being

2167
00:36:39,260 --> 00:36:40,460
impertinent myself.

2168
00:36:40,660 --> 00:36:41,540
I shall soon grow

2169
00:36:41,540 --> 00:36:42,740
afraid of him.

2170
00:36:43,400 --> 00:36:44,340
On his approaching them

2171
00:36:44,340 --> 00:36:45,500
soon afterwards, though,

2172
00:36:45,500 --> 00:36:46,180
without seeming

2173
00:36:46,180 --> 00:36:47,060
to have any intention

2174
00:36:47,060 --> 00:36:48,020
of speaking.

2175
00:36:48,020 --> 00:36:49,320
Miss Lucas defied her

2176
00:36:49,320 --> 00:36:50,140
friend to mention

2177
00:36:50,140 --> 00:36:51,360
such a subject to him,

2178
00:36:51,500 --> 00:36:52,260
which immediately

2179
00:36:52,260 --> 00:36:52,660
provoking

2180
00:36:52,660 --> 00:36:53,680
Elizabeth to do it.

2181
00:36:53,680 --> 00:36:54,420
She turned to him

2182
00:36:54,420 --> 00:36:55,620
and said.

2183
00:36:55,800 --> 00:36:56,840
Did you not think, Mr.

2184
00:36:56,840 --> 00:36:57,500
Darcy,

2185
00:36:57,500 --> 00:36:58,800
that I expressed myself

2186
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:00,360
uncommonly well just now

2187
00:37:00,500 --> 00:37:01,440
when I was teasing

2188
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:02,180
Colonel Foster

2189
00:37:02,180 --> 00:37:02,640
to give us all

2190
00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:03,680
a ball at Meriton.

2191
00:37:04,700 --> 00:37:05,840
With great energy.

2192
00:37:05,840 --> 00:37:06,260
But it is

2193
00:37:06,260 --> 00:37:06,780
a subject

2194
00:37:06,780 --> 00:37:07,500
which always makes

2195
00:37:07,500 --> 00:37:08,700
a lady energetic.

2196
00:37:09,960 --> 00:37:11,480
He was severe on us.

2197
00:37:12,060 --> 00:37:13,740
It will be her turn soon

2198
00:37:13,740 --> 00:37:15,260
to be teased, said Ms..

2199
00:37:15,260 --> 00:37:16,220
Lucas.

2200
00:37:16,220 --> 00:37:16,980
I am going to open

2201
00:37:16,980 --> 00:37:17,820
the instrument, Eliza.

2202
00:37:17,820 --> 00:37:18,240
And you know

2203
00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:19,440
what follows.

2204
00:37:19,820 --> 00:37:20,340
You are a

2205
00:37:20,340 --> 00:37:21,620
very strange creature

2206
00:37:21,620 --> 00:37:22,820
by way of a friend

2207
00:37:22,920 --> 00:37:23,900
always wanting me

2208
00:37:23,900 --> 00:37:24,320
to play

2209
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:25,560
and sing before anybody

2210
00:37:25,560 --> 00:37:26,760
and everybody.

2211
00:37:26,900 --> 00:37:28,020
If my vanity had taken

2212
00:37:28,020 --> 00:37:28,800
a musical turn,

2213
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:29,160
you would have

2214
00:37:29,160 --> 00:37:30,360
been invaluable.

2215
00:37:31,220 --> 00:37:31,920
But as it is,

2216
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:32,460
I would really

2217
00:37:32,460 --> 00:37:32,940
rather not

2218
00:37:32,940 --> 00:37:33,500
sit down

2219
00:37:33,500 --> 00:37:34,140
before those

2220
00:37:34,140 --> 00:37:35,120
who must be in the habit

2221
00:37:35,120 --> 00:37:35,540
of hearing

2222
00:37:35,540 --> 00:37:35,940
the very

2223
00:37:35,940 --> 00:37:37,140
best performers.

2224
00:37:37,980 --> 00:37:38,820
On Miss Lucas

2225
00:37:38,820 --> 00:37:40,040
is persevering, however,

2226
00:37:40,040 --> 00:37:41,240
she added.

2227
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:42,180
Very well.

2228
00:37:42,180 --> 00:37:43,200
If it must be so,

2229
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:44,360
it must.

2230
00:37:44,360 --> 00:37:45,080
And gravely

2231
00:37:45,080 --> 00:37:45,920
glancing at Mr.

2232
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:47,120
Darcy.

2233
00:37:47,120 --> 00:37:48,120
There is a fine old.

2234
00:37:48,120 --> 00:37:48,800
Saying

2235
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:49,820
which everybody here is,

2236
00:37:49,820 --> 00:37:50,220
of course,

2237
00:37:50,220 --> 00:37:51,240
familiar with.

2238
00:37:51,240 --> 00:37:52,080
Keep your breath

2239
00:37:52,080 --> 00:37:53,280
to cool your porridge

2240
00:37:53,540 --> 00:37:54,840
and I shall keep mine.

2241
00:37:54,840 --> 00:37:55,880
To spell my song.

2242
00:37:56,880 --> 00:37:57,660
Her performance

2243
00:37:57,660 --> 00:37:58,580
was pleasing,

2244
00:37:58,580 --> 00:37:58,800
though

2245
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:00,120
by no means capital

2246
00:38:00,500 --> 00:38:01,880
after a song or two

2247
00:38:02,040 --> 00:38:02,580
and before

2248
00:38:02,580 --> 00:38:03,260
she could reply

2249
00:38:03,260 --> 00:38:04,040
to the entreaties

2250
00:38:04,040 --> 00:38:04,520
of several

2251
00:38:04,520 --> 00:38:04,940
that she would

2252
00:38:04,940 --> 00:38:05,840
sing again,

2253
00:38:05,840 --> 00:38:06,180
she was

2254
00:38:06,180 --> 00:38:07,100
eagerly succeeded

2255
00:38:07,100 --> 00:38:07,860
at the instrument

2256
00:38:07,860 --> 00:38:09,060
by her sister Mary,

2257
00:38:09,260 --> 00:38:09,900
who, having

2258
00:38:09,900 --> 00:38:10,520
in consequence

2259
00:38:10,520 --> 00:38:11,520
of being the only plain

2260
00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:12,560
one in the family,

2261
00:38:12,560 --> 00:38:13,220
worked hard

2262
00:38:13,220 --> 00:38:13,760
for knowledge

2263
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:14,720
and accomplishments,

2264
00:38:14,720 --> 00:38:15,960
was always impatient

2265
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:17,160
for display.

2266
00:38:17,460 --> 00:38:18,420
Mary had neither

2267
00:38:18,420 --> 00:38:19,620
genius nor taste,

2268
00:38:19,820 --> 00:38:20,780
and though vanity

2269
00:38:20,780 --> 00:38:21,980
given her application.

2270
00:38:22,100 --> 00:38:22,680
It had given.

2271
00:38:22,680 --> 00:38:24,060
Her likewise a pedantic

2272
00:38:24,080 --> 00:38:25,320
and conceited manner,

2273
00:38:25,560 --> 00:38:26,240
which would have ensured

2274
00:38:26,240 --> 00:38:26,900
a higher degree

2275
00:38:26,900 --> 00:38:27,500
of excellence

2276
00:38:27,500 --> 00:38:28,700
than she had reached.

2277
00:38:28,760 --> 00:38:29,580
Elizabeth.

2278
00:38:29,580 --> 00:38:30,860
Easy and unaffected

2279
00:38:30,860 --> 00:38:32,000
she had been listened to

2280
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:32,580
with much more

2281
00:38:32,580 --> 00:38:33,380
pleasure, though

2282
00:38:33,380 --> 00:38:33,960
not playing

2283
00:38:33,960 --> 00:38:35,120
half so well.

2284
00:38:35,120 --> 00:38:35,780
And Mary,

2285
00:38:35,780 --> 00:38:36,300
at the end of

2286
00:38:36,300 --> 00:38:37,500
a long concerto,

2287
00:38:37,500 --> 00:38:37,980
was glad

2288
00:38:37,980 --> 00:38:38,460
to purchase

2289
00:38:38,460 --> 00:38:39,540
praise and gratitude

2290
00:38:39,540 --> 00:38:41,100
by Scotch and Irish ears

2291
00:38:41,300 --> 00:38:42,200
at the request of her

2292
00:38:42,200 --> 00:38:43,620
younger sisters, who,

2293
00:38:43,640 --> 00:38:44,700
with some of the Lucas's

2294
00:38:44,700 --> 00:38:45,320
and two or three.

2295
00:38:45,320 --> 00:38:46,460
Officers, joined.

2296
00:38:46,460 --> 00:38:47,040
Eagerly in

2297
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:47,820
dancing at one

2298
00:38:47,820 --> 00:38:49,020
end of the room.

2299
00:38:49,500 --> 00:38:49,820
Mr.

2300
00:38:49,820 --> 00:38:50,480
Darcy stood

2301
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:50,900
near them

2302
00:38:50,900 --> 00:38:51,980
in silent indignation

2303
00:38:51,980 --> 00:38:52,560
at such a mode

2304
00:38:52,560 --> 00:38:53,120
of passing the.

2305
00:38:53,120 --> 00:38:54,000
Evening to the.

2306
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:54,540
Exclusion

2307
00:38:54,540 --> 00:38:55,740
of all conversation,

2308
00:38:55,820 --> 00:38:56,340
and was too

2309
00:38:56,340 --> 00:38:57,000
much engrossed

2310
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:57,660
by his thoughts

2311
00:38:57,660 --> 00:38:58,340
to perceive that Sir

2312
00:38:58,340 --> 00:38:59,040
William Lucas

2313
00:38:59,040 --> 00:38:59,960
was his neighbor.

2314
00:38:59,960 --> 00:39:01,020
Till Sir William thus

2315
00:39:01,020 --> 00:39:02,220
began.

2316
00:39:02,280 --> 00:39:03,000
What a charming

2317
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:03,500
amusement

2318
00:39:03,500 --> 00:39:04,320
for young people.

2319
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:04,980
This is Mr.

2320
00:39:04,980 --> 00:39:05,940
Darcy.

2321
00:39:05,940 --> 00:39:06,440
There is nothing

2322
00:39:06,440 --> 00:39:07,820
like dancing after all.

2323
00:39:08,220 --> 00:39:09,020
I consider it

2324
00:39:09,020 --> 00:39:09,500
as one of the

2325
00:39:09,500 --> 00:39:10,440
first refinements

2326
00:39:10,440 --> 00:39:11,840
of polished societies.

2327
00:39:12,260 --> 00:39:13,460
Certainly, sir.

2328
00:39:13,680 --> 00:39:14,820
And it has the advantage

2329
00:39:14,820 --> 00:39:15,800
also of being in vogue

2330
00:39:15,800 --> 00:39:16,500
amongst the less

2331
00:39:16,500 --> 00:39:17,420
polished societies

2332
00:39:17,420 --> 00:39:18,420
of the world.

2333
00:39:18,420 --> 00:39:19,760
Every savage can dance.

2334
00:39:21,560 --> 00:39:22,140
Sir William

2335
00:39:22,140 --> 00:39:23,340
only smiled.

2336
00:39:23,600 --> 00:39:24,180
Your friend

2337
00:39:24,180 --> 00:39:25,380
performs delightfully.

2338
00:39:25,620 --> 00:39:26,280
He continued

2339
00:39:26,280 --> 00:39:27,380
after a pause

2340
00:39:27,380 --> 00:39:28,340
on seeing Bingley

2341
00:39:28,340 --> 00:39:29,540
join the group.

2342
00:39:29,940 --> 00:39:30,560
And I doubt

2343
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:30,980
not that

2344
00:39:30,980 --> 00:39:31,740
you are an adept

2345
00:39:31,740 --> 00:39:32,400
in the science

2346
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:33,140
yourself, Mr.

2347
00:39:33,140 --> 00:39:34,340
Darcy.

2348
00:39:34,740 --> 00:39:35,760
You saw me dance

2349
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:36,300
at merit,

2350
00:39:36,300 --> 00:39:37,500
I believe, sir.

2351
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:38,460
Yes, indeed.

2352
00:39:38,460 --> 00:39:38,880
And received

2353
00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:39,780
no inconsiderable

2354
00:39:39,780 --> 00:39:40,980
pleasure from the sight.

2355
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:43,220
Do you often dance at St

2356
00:39:43,220 --> 00:39:44,420
James's?

2357
00:39:45,080 --> 00:39:46,280
Never, sir.

2358
00:39:47,160 --> 00:39:47,780
Do you not think

2359
00:39:47,780 --> 00:39:48,080
it would be

2360
00:39:48,080 --> 00:39:48,440
a proper

2361
00:39:48,440 --> 00:39:49,640
complement to the place?

2362
00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:51,780
It is a compliment

2363
00:39:51,780 --> 00:39:52,320
which I never

2364
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:53,280
pay to any place

2365
00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:54,480
if I can avoid it.

2366
00:39:55,280 --> 00:39:55,700
You have

2367
00:39:55,700 --> 00:39:56,660
a house in town,

2368
00:39:56,660 --> 00:39:57,860
I conclude.

2369
00:39:58,200 --> 00:39:58,500
Mr.

2370
00:39:58,500 --> 00:39:59,700
Darcy bowed.

2371
00:39:59,900 --> 00:40:00,500
I had one.

2372
00:40:00,500 --> 00:40:01,080
Some thoughts

2373
00:40:01,080 --> 00:40:01,860
of fixing in town

2374
00:40:01,860 --> 00:40:02,520
myself, for

2375
00:40:02,520 --> 00:40:03,080
I am fond of

2376
00:40:03,080 --> 00:40:04,380
superior society,

2377
00:40:05,400 --> 00:40:06,200
but I did not feel

2378
00:40:06,200 --> 00:40:06,840
quite certain

2379
00:40:06,840 --> 00:40:07,820
that the Air of London

2380
00:40:07,820 --> 00:40:08,280
would agree

2381
00:40:08,280 --> 00:40:09,260
with Lady Lucas.

2382
00:40:10,760 --> 00:40:11,460
He paused in

2383
00:40:11,460 --> 00:40:12,660
hopes of an answer,

2384
00:40:12,680 --> 00:40:13,460
but his companion

2385
00:40:13,460 --> 00:40:14,220
was not disposed

2386
00:40:14,220 --> 00:40:15,420
to make any,

2387
00:40:16,040 --> 00:40:16,740
and Elizabeth,

2388
00:40:16,740 --> 00:40:17,580
at that instant,

2389
00:40:17,580 --> 00:40:18,780
moving towards them.

2390
00:40:18,780 --> 00:40:19,380
He was struck

2391
00:40:19,380 --> 00:40:19,920
with the notion

2392
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:20,280
of doing

2393
00:40:20,280 --> 00:40:21,480
a very gallant thing

2394
00:40:21,600 --> 00:40:22,800
and called out to her.

2395
00:40:22,940 --> 00:40:24,120
My dear Miss Eliza,

2396
00:40:24,120 --> 00:40:25,320
why are not you dancing,

2397
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:26,580
Mr. Darcy?

2398
00:40:26,580 --> 00:40:27,300
You must allow me

2399
00:40:27,300 --> 00:40:27,960
to present this

2400
00:40:27,960 --> 00:40:28,800
young lady to you

2401
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:29,220
as a very

2402
00:40:29,220 --> 00:40:30,420
desirable partner.

2403
00:40:30,780 --> 00:40:31,800
You cannot refuse

2404
00:40:31,800 --> 00:40:32,300
to dance.

2405
00:40:32,300 --> 00:40:32,840
I'm sure,

2406
00:40:32,840 --> 00:40:33,900
when so much beauty

2407
00:40:33,900 --> 00:40:35,100
is before you.

2408
00:40:35,420 --> 00:40:36,620
And taking her hand.

2409
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:37,220
He would have

2410
00:40:37,220 --> 00:40:37,980
given it to Mr.

2411
00:40:37,980 --> 00:40:39,020
Darcy, who, though

2412
00:40:39,020 --> 00:40:40,160
extremely surprised,

2413
00:40:40,160 --> 00:40:41,000
was not unwilling

2414
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:42,200
to receive it.

2415
00:40:42,420 --> 00:40:43,440
When she instantly

2416
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:45,060
drew back and said with

2417
00:40:45,060 --> 00:40:45,980
some dis composure

2418
00:40:45,980 --> 00:40:46,980
to Sir William.

2419
00:40:46,980 --> 00:40:48,020
Indeed, sir.

2420
00:40:48,020 --> 00:40:48,560
I have not the

2421
00:40:48,560 --> 00:40:49,320
least intention

2422
00:40:49,320 --> 00:40:50,240
of dancing.

2423
00:40:50,240 --> 00:40:50,900
I entreat you

2424
00:40:50,900 --> 00:40:51,500
not to suppose

2425
00:40:51,500 --> 00:40:52,440
that I moved this way

2426
00:40:52,440 --> 00:40:53,100
in order to beg

2427
00:40:53,100 --> 00:40:54,300
for a partner.

2428
00:40:54,600 --> 00:40:54,960
Mr.

2429
00:40:54,960 --> 00:40:55,400
Darcy,

2430
00:40:55,400 --> 00:40:56,600
with grave propriety

2431
00:40:56,760 --> 00:40:57,800
requested to be allowed

2432
00:40:57,800 --> 00:40:59,000
the honor of her hand.

2433
00:40:59,000 --> 00:40:59,740
But. In vain.

2434
00:41:01,400 --> 00:41:02,100
Elizabeth was

2435
00:41:02,100 --> 00:41:02,960
determined.

2436
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:03,560
Nor did Sir

2437
00:41:03,560 --> 00:41:04,220
William at all

2438
00:41:04,220 --> 00:41:05,080
shake her purpose

2439
00:41:05,080 --> 00:41:05,760
by his attempt

2440
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:06,960
at persuasion.

2441
00:41:08,120 --> 00:41:08,600
Excel

2442
00:41:08,600 --> 00:41:09,720
so much in the dance,

2443
00:41:09,720 --> 00:41:10,820
Miss Eliza,

2444
00:41:10,820 --> 00:41:11,720
that it is cruel

2445
00:41:11,720 --> 00:41:12,980
to deny me the happiness

2446
00:41:12,980 --> 00:41:13,920
of seeing you.

2447
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:14,300
And though

2448
00:41:14,300 --> 00:41:15,680
this gentleman dislikes

2449
00:41:15,680 --> 00:41:16,320
the amusements

2450
00:41:16,320 --> 00:41:17,040
in general,

2451
00:41:17,040 --> 00:41:17,520
he can have

2452
00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:18,260
no objection.

2453
00:41:18,260 --> 00:41:19,820
I am sure to oblige us

2454
00:41:19,820 --> 00:41:21,260
for one half hour.

2455
00:41:21,420 --> 00:41:21,800
Mr.

2456
00:41:21,800 --> 00:41:23,420
Darcy is all politeness.

2457
00:41:23,700 --> 00:41:25,040
Said Elizabeth, smiling.

2458
00:41:25,560 --> 00:41:26,760
He is indeed.

2459
00:41:27,060 --> 00:41:27,780
But considering

2460
00:41:27,780 --> 00:41:29,060
the inducement, my dear

2461
00:41:29,060 --> 00:41:29,700
Miss Eliza,

2462
00:41:29,700 --> 00:41:30,420
we cannot wonder

2463
00:41:30,420 --> 00:41:31,620
at his complacence

2464
00:41:31,800 --> 00:41:32,600
for who would object

2465
00:41:32,600 --> 00:41:33,800
to such a partner.

2466
00:41:33,840 --> 00:41:35,400
Elizabeth looked archly

2467
00:41:35,400 --> 00:41:36,600
and turned away

2468
00:41:36,780 --> 00:41:37,460
her resistance,

2469
00:41:37,460 --> 00:41:38,480
as had not injured her

2470
00:41:38,480 --> 00:41:39,440
with the gentleman,

2471
00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:39,860
and he was

2472
00:41:39,860 --> 00:41:40,380
thinking of her

2473
00:41:40,380 --> 00:41:41,580
with some complacency

2474
00:41:41,760 --> 00:41:42,920
when thus accosted

2475
00:41:42,920 --> 00:41:44,120
by Miss Bingley.

2476
00:41:44,920 --> 00:41:46,220
I can guess the subject

2477
00:41:46,220 --> 00:41:47,420
of your reverie.

2478
00:41:47,820 --> 00:41:49,040
I should imagine not.

2479
00:41:50,180 --> 00:41:51,440
You are considering

2480
00:41:51,440 --> 00:41:52,680
how insupportable

2481
00:41:52,680 --> 00:41:53,460
it would be to pass

2482
00:41:53,460 --> 00:41:54,200
many evenings

2483
00:41:54,200 --> 00:41:55,100
in this manner.

2484
00:41:55,100 --> 00:41:56,820
In such society.

2485
00:41:57,180 --> 00:41:58,200
And indeed, I.

2486
00:41:58,200 --> 00:41:58,920
Am quite

2487
00:41:58,920 --> 00:41:59,940
of your opinion.

2488
00:41:59,940 --> 00:42:01,040
I was never more

2489
00:42:01,040 --> 00:42:03,320
annoyed the insipidity

2490
00:42:03,560 --> 00:42:04,880
and hear to the noise

2491
00:42:05,220 --> 00:42:06,240
than nothingness.

2492
00:42:06,240 --> 00:42:06,780
And yet

2493
00:42:06,780 --> 00:42:08,360
the self-importance

2494
00:42:08,360 --> 00:42:09,720
of all those people.

2495
00:42:10,280 --> 00:42:11,340
What would I give

2496
00:42:11,340 --> 00:42:12,620
to hear your strictures

2497
00:42:12,620 --> 00:42:13,800
on them?

2498
00:42:13,800 --> 00:42:14,580
Your conjecture

2499
00:42:14,580 --> 00:42:15,740
is totally wrong.

2500
00:42:15,740 --> 00:42:16,940
I assure you

2501
00:42:16,940 --> 00:42:17,720
my mind was

2502
00:42:17,720 --> 00:42:19,940
more agreeably engaged.

2503
00:42:21,260 --> 00:42:22,340
I have been meditating

2504
00:42:22,340 --> 00:42:22,520
on the

2505
00:42:22,520 --> 00:42:23,420
very great pleasure,

2506
00:42:23,420 --> 00:42:23,940
which a pair

2507
00:42:23,940 --> 00:42:25,140
of fine eyes in the face

2508
00:42:25,140 --> 00:42:25,680
of a pretty

2509
00:42:25,680 --> 00:42:26,880
woman can bestow.

2510
00:42:27,960 --> 00:42:29,220
Miss Bingley immediately

2511
00:42:29,220 --> 00:42:29,780
fixed her

2512
00:42:29,780 --> 00:42:30,980
eyes on his face

2513
00:42:31,020 --> 00:42:31,740
and desired

2514
00:42:31,740 --> 00:42:32,340
he would tell her

2515
00:42:32,340 --> 00:42:32,960
what lady

2516
00:42:32,960 --> 00:42:33,500
had the credit

2517
00:42:33,500 --> 00:42:34,200
of inspiring

2518
00:42:34,200 --> 00:42:35,420
such reflections.

2519
00:42:35,820 --> 00:42:36,180
Mr.

2520
00:42:36,180 --> 00:42:36,960
Darcy replied

2521
00:42:36,960 --> 00:42:37,760
with great intrepid

2522
00:42:37,760 --> 00:42:38,960
pity.

2523
00:42:39,260 --> 00:42:40,200
Miss Elizabeth Bennett.

2524
00:42:41,880 --> 00:42:42,480
Mrs.

2525
00:42:42,480 --> 00:42:43,760
Lizabeth Bennett.

2526
00:42:44,120 --> 00:42:45,320
Repeated Miss Bingley.

2527
00:42:45,900 --> 00:42:47,720
I am all astonishment.

2528
00:42:48,360 --> 00:42:49,820
How long has she been

2529
00:42:49,820 --> 00:42:51,020
such a favorite

2530
00:42:51,120 --> 00:42:52,040
and prey?

2531
00:42:52,040 --> 00:42:52,640
When am I

2532
00:42:52,640 --> 00:42:53,840
to wish you joy?

2533
00:42:54,780 --> 00:42:55,640
That Is exactly

2534
00:42:55,640 --> 00:42:56,120
the question

2535
00:42:56,120 --> 00:42:57,060
which I expected you

2536
00:42:57,060 --> 00:42:58,100
to ask.

2537
00:42:58,100 --> 00:42:58,700
A lady's

2538
00:42:58,700 --> 00:42:59,480
imagination is

2539
00:42:59,480 --> 00:43:00,540
very rapid.

2540
00:43:00,540 --> 00:43:01,820
It jumps from admiration

2541
00:43:01,820 --> 00:43:02,600
to love.

2542
00:43:02,600 --> 00:43:03,720
From love to matrimony

2543
00:43:03,720 --> 00:43:04,620
in a moment.

2544
00:43:04,620 --> 00:43:05,420
I knew you would be

2545
00:43:05,420 --> 00:43:06,620
wishing me joy.

2546
00:43:06,840 --> 00:43:09,240
Nay, if you are serious

2547
00:43:09,240 --> 00:43:09,980
about it,

2548
00:43:09,980 --> 00:43:10,880
I shall consider.

2549
00:43:10,880 --> 00:43:11,340
The matter

2550
00:43:11,340 --> 00:43:12,960
is absolutely settled.

2551
00:43:13,500 --> 00:43:14,340
You will be having

2552
00:43:14,340 --> 00:43:15,300
a charming mother

2553
00:43:15,300 --> 00:43:15,680
in law.

2554
00:43:15,680 --> 00:43:16,640
Indeed.

2555
00:43:16,640 --> 00:43:17,760
And of course,

2556
00:43:17,760 --> 00:43:18,120
she will

2557
00:43:18,120 --> 00:43:18,780
always be

2558
00:43:18,780 --> 00:43:20,040
at Pemberley with you.

2559
00:43:20,940 --> 00:43:21,680
He listened to her

2560
00:43:21,680 --> 00:43:22,220
with perfect

2561
00:43:22,220 --> 00:43:22,880
indifference

2562
00:43:22,880 --> 00:43:23,660
while she chose

2563
00:43:23,660 --> 00:43:24,660
to entertain herself

2564
00:43:24,660 --> 00:43:25,640
in this manner,

2565
00:43:25,640 --> 00:43:26,720
and as his composure

2566
00:43:26,720 --> 00:43:27,300
convinced her

2567
00:43:27,300 --> 00:43:28,580
that all was safe, her

2568
00:43:28,580 --> 00:43:30,060
wit flowed along.

2569
00:43:33,800 --> 00:43:35,000
Chapter seven

2570
00:43:36,060 --> 00:43:36,380
Mr.

2571
00:43:36,380 --> 00:43:36,780
Bennett's

2572
00:43:36,780 --> 00:43:37,760
property consisted

2573
00:43:37,760 --> 00:43:38,700
almost entirely

2574
00:43:38,700 --> 00:43:40,040
in an estate of 2000

2575
00:43:40,040 --> 00:43:40,700
a year,

2576
00:43:40,700 --> 00:43:41,700
which unfortunately for

2577
00:43:41,700 --> 00:43:42,500
his daughters,

2578
00:43:42,500 --> 00:43:43,620
was entailed in

2579
00:43:43,620 --> 00:43:44,940
default of heirs mail

2580
00:43:45,180 --> 00:43:46,460
on a distant relation

2581
00:43:46,800 --> 00:43:47,220
and their

2582
00:43:47,220 --> 00:43:48,240
mother's fortune.

2583
00:43:48,240 --> 00:43:48,860
Though ample

2584
00:43:48,860 --> 00:43:49,620
for his situation

2585
00:43:49,620 --> 00:43:50,360
in life

2586
00:43:50,360 --> 00:43:51,540
could but ill supply

2587
00:43:51,540 --> 00:43:52,740
the deficiency of his.

2588
00:43:53,120 --> 00:43:53,960
Her father had been

2589
00:43:53,960 --> 00:43:55,160
an attorney in Meriton

2590
00:43:55,340 --> 00:43:57,420
and had left her ?4,000.

2591
00:43:58,020 --> 00:43:58,800
She had a sister

2592
00:43:58,800 --> 00:43:59,540
married to a mr.

2593
00:43:59,540 --> 00:44:00,240
Phillips

2594
00:44:00,240 --> 00:44:01,040
who had been a clerk

2595
00:44:01,040 --> 00:44:01,700
to their father

2596
00:44:01,700 --> 00:44:02,400
and succeeded him

2597
00:44:02,400 --> 00:44:03,300
in the business,

2598
00:44:03,300 --> 00:44:03,960
and her brother

2599
00:44:03,960 --> 00:44:04,760
settled in London

2600
00:44:04,760 --> 00:44:05,480
in a respectable

2601
00:44:05,480 --> 00:44:06,680
line of trade.

2602
00:44:07,340 --> 00:44:07,920
The village of

2603
00:44:07,920 --> 00:44:08,420
Long Bourn

2604
00:44:08,420 --> 00:44:09,000
was only one

2605
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:10,200
mile from Meriton.

2606
00:44:10,260 --> 00:44:11,240
A most convenient.

2607
00:44:11,240 --> 00:44:11,720
Distance

2608
00:44:11,720 --> 00:44:12,840
for the young ladies

2609
00:44:12,840 --> 00:44:13,880
who were usually tempted

2610
00:44:13,880 --> 00:44:14,460
thither three

2611
00:44:14,460 --> 00:44:15,620
or four times a week

2612
00:44:15,620 --> 00:44:16,460
to pay their duty

2613
00:44:16,460 --> 00:44:17,240
to their aunt

2614
00:44:17,240 --> 00:44:18,420
and to a milliners shop.

2615
00:44:18,420 --> 00:44:19,620
Just over the way

2616
00:44:19,740 --> 00:44:20,460
the two youngest

2617
00:44:20,460 --> 00:44:21,540
of the family Catherine

2618
00:44:21,540 --> 00:44:22,280
and Lydia

2619
00:44:22,280 --> 00:44:23,000
were particularly

2620
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:23,520
frequent

2621
00:44:23,520 --> 00:44:24,680
in these attentions.

2622
00:44:24,680 --> 00:44:25,320
Their minds

2623
00:44:25,320 --> 00:44:26,100
were more vacant

2624
00:44:26,100 --> 00:44:27,080
than their sisters,

2625
00:44:27,080 --> 00:44:28,080
and when nothing better

2626
00:44:28,080 --> 00:44:29,280
offered a walk to

2627
00:44:29,280 --> 00:44:30,420
Meriton was necessary

2628
00:44:30,420 --> 00:44:31,040
to amuse their

2629
00:44:31,040 --> 00:44:31,940
morning hours

2630
00:44:31,940 --> 00:44:33,180
and furnish conversation

2631
00:44:33,180 --> 00:44:34,160
for the evening.

2632
00:44:34,160 --> 00:44:35,420
And however bare of news

2633
00:44:35,420 --> 00:44:35,880
the country

2634
00:44:35,880 --> 00:44:36,600
in general might.

2635
00:44:36,600 --> 00:44:37,700
Be, they always.

2636
00:44:37,700 --> 00:44:39,020
Contrive to learn some

2637
00:44:39,020 --> 00:44:40,220
from their aunt

2638
00:44:40,320 --> 00:44:41,040
at present.

2639
00:44:41,040 --> 00:44:41,780
Indeed,

2640
00:44:41,780 --> 00:44:42,800
they were well supplied,

2641
00:44:42,800 --> 00:44:43,500
both with news

2642
00:44:43,500 --> 00:44:44,540
and happiness

2643
00:44:44,540 --> 00:44:45,600
by the recent arrival

2644
00:44:45,600 --> 00:44:46,560
of a militia regiment

2645
00:44:46,560 --> 00:44:47,480
in the neighborhood.

2646
00:44:47,480 --> 00:44:48,380
It was to remain

2647
00:44:48,380 --> 00:44:49,320
the whole winter,

2648
00:44:49,320 --> 00:44:50,300
and Burton was

2649
00:44:50,300 --> 00:44:51,500
the headquarters.

2650
00:44:51,680 --> 00:44:52,760
Their visits to Mrs.

2651
00:44:52,760 --> 00:44:53,520
Phillips were now

2652
00:44:53,520 --> 00:44:54,480
productive of the most

2653
00:44:54,480 --> 00:44:55,100
interesting

2654
00:44:55,100 --> 00:44:56,180
intelligence.

2655
00:44:56,180 --> 00:44:56,940
Every day

2656
00:44:56,940 --> 00:44:57,720
added something

2657
00:44:57,720 --> 00:44:58,380
to their knowledge

2658
00:44:58,380 --> 00:44:59,060
of the officers

2659
00:44:59,060 --> 00:45:00,320
names and connections.

2660
00:45:00,660 --> 00:45:01,520
Their lodgings were

2661
00:45:01,520 --> 00:45:02,720
not long a secret,

2662
00:45:02,780 --> 00:45:03,440
and at length

2663
00:45:03,440 --> 00:45:04,100
they began to know

2664
00:45:04,100 --> 00:45:05,400
the officers themselves.

2665
00:45:05,760 --> 00:45:06,120
Mr.

2666
00:45:06,120 --> 00:45:06,500
Phillips

2667
00:45:06,500 --> 00:45:07,460
visited them all.

2668
00:45:07,460 --> 00:45:08,300
And this open to

2669
00:45:08,300 --> 00:45:08,760
his niece

2670
00:45:08,760 --> 00:45:09,200
is a story

2671
00:45:09,200 --> 00:45:10,400
of Felicity, unknown.

2672
00:45:10,820 --> 00:45:11,640
They could talk

2673
00:45:11,640 --> 00:45:13,180
of nothing but officers

2674
00:45:13,400 --> 00:45:14,100
and Mr. Big.

2675
00:45:14,100 --> 00:45:15,300
These large fortune,

2676
00:45:15,300 --> 00:45:15,800
the mention

2677
00:45:15,800 --> 00:45:16,340
of which gave

2678
00:45:16,340 --> 00:45:16,980
animation to

2679
00:45:16,980 --> 00:45:17,660
their mother,

2680
00:45:17,660 --> 00:45:18,480
was worthless

2681
00:45:18,480 --> 00:45:19,140
in their eyes

2682
00:45:19,140 --> 00:45:19,740
when opposed to

2683
00:45:19,740 --> 00:45:20,520
the regimental odds

2684
00:45:20,520 --> 00:45:21,720
of an ensign.

2685
00:45:22,080 --> 00:45:22,880
After listening

2686
00:45:22,880 --> 00:45:23,400
one morning

2687
00:45:23,400 --> 00:45:24,180
to their effusions

2688
00:45:24,180 --> 00:45:25,220
on this subject.

2689
00:45:25,220 --> 00:45:25,560
Mr.

2690
00:45:25,560 --> 00:45:26,780
Bennett coolly observed.

2691
00:45:27,720 --> 00:45:28,320
From all that

2692
00:45:28,320 --> 00:45:29,000
I can collect

2693
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:29,640
by your manner

2694
00:45:29,640 --> 00:45:30,240
of talking,

2695
00:45:30,240 --> 00:45:30,680
you must be

2696
00:45:30,680 --> 00:45:31,080
two of the

2697
00:45:31,080 --> 00:45:31,920
silliest girls

2698
00:45:31,920 --> 00:45:32,960
in the country.

2699
00:45:32,960 --> 00:45:34,140
I have suspected it

2700
00:45:34,140 --> 00:45:35,460
some time, but I am now

2701
00:45:35,460 --> 00:45:36,660
convinced.

2702
00:45:36,900 --> 00:45:37,400
Catherine

2703
00:45:37,400 --> 00:45:38,460
was disconcerted

2704
00:45:38,460 --> 00:45:39,660
and made no answer.

2705
00:45:39,840 --> 00:45:40,820
But with

2706
00:45:40,820 --> 00:45:42,020
perfect indifference,

2707
00:45:42,020 --> 00:45:43,100
continued to express her

2708
00:45:43,100 --> 00:45:43,680
admiration

2709
00:45:43,680 --> 00:45:44,760
of Captain Carter

2710
00:45:44,760 --> 00:45:45,260
and her hope

2711
00:45:45,260 --> 00:45:45,780
of seeing him

2712
00:45:45,780 --> 00:45:46,880
in the course of the day

2713
00:45:46,880 --> 00:45:47,580
as he was going

2714
00:45:47,580 --> 00:45:48,320
the next morning

2715
00:45:48,320 --> 00:45:49,520
to London.

2716
00:45:49,700 --> 00:45:51,140
I am astonished,

2717
00:45:51,140 --> 00:45:52,760
my dear, said Mrs..

2718
00:45:52,760 --> 00:45:53,360
Bennett.

2719
00:45:53,360 --> 00:45:54,180
That you should be

2720
00:45:54,180 --> 00:45:54,620
so ready

2721
00:45:54,620 --> 00:45:54,980
to think

2722
00:45:54,980 --> 00:45:56,300
your own children silly.

2723
00:45:56,660 --> 00:45:57,720
If I wish to think

2724
00:45:57,720 --> 00:45:58,260
slighting

2725
00:45:58,260 --> 00:45:59,360
of anybody's children,

2726
00:45:59,360 --> 00:46:00,060
it should not be

2727
00:46:00,060 --> 00:46:00,660
of my own.

2728
00:46:00,660 --> 00:46:01,860
However.

2729
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:02,880
If my children

2730
00:46:02,880 --> 00:46:03,320
are silly,

2731
00:46:03,320 --> 00:46:04,040
I must hope to be

2732
00:46:04,040 --> 00:46:05,400
always sensible of it.

2733
00:46:06,480 --> 00:46:07,200
Yes, but

2734
00:46:07,200 --> 00:46:08,000
as it happens,

2735
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:08,640
they are all of them.

2736
00:46:08,640 --> 00:46:09,840
Very clever.

2737
00:46:10,320 --> 00:46:11,340
This is the only point

2738
00:46:11,340 --> 00:46:12,260
I flatter myself

2739
00:46:12,260 --> 00:46:12,740
on which we

2740
00:46:12,740 --> 00:46:13,940
do not agree.

2741
00:46:14,280 --> 00:46:14,900
I had hoped

2742
00:46:14,900 --> 00:46:15,740
that our sentiments

2743
00:46:15,740 --> 00:46:16,640
coincided

2744
00:46:16,640 --> 00:46:17,840
in every particular,

2745
00:46:18,020 --> 00:46:19,220
but I must so far differ

2746
00:46:19,220 --> 00:46:19,760
from use

2747
00:46:19,760 --> 00:46:20,300
to think our

2748
00:46:20,300 --> 00:46:21,560
two youngest daughters

2749
00:46:21,560 --> 00:46:22,760
uncommonly foolish.

2750
00:46:23,600 --> 00:46:24,740
My dear Mr.

2751
00:46:24,740 --> 00:46:26,180
Bennett, you must not

2752
00:46:26,180 --> 00:46:27,260
expect such girls

2753
00:46:27,260 --> 00:46:27,560
to have the.

2754
00:46:27,560 --> 00:46:28,080
Sense of their

2755
00:46:28,080 --> 00:46:28,620
father and.

2756
00:46:28,620 --> 00:46:29,360
Mother

2757
00:46:29,360 --> 00:46:29,840
when they get

2758
00:46:29,840 --> 00:46:30,560
to our age.

2759
00:46:30,560 --> 00:46:31,140
I dare say

2760
00:46:31,140 --> 00:46:31,740
they will not think

2761
00:46:31,740 --> 00:46:32,340
about officers

2762
00:46:32,340 --> 00:46:33,540
any more than we do.

2763
00:46:34,080 --> 00:46:35,000
I remember the time

2764
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:35,600
when I liked

2765
00:46:35,600 --> 00:46:36,660
a red coat myself

2766
00:46:36,660 --> 00:46:37,860
very well,

2767
00:46:37,860 --> 00:46:38,760
and indeed so

2768
00:46:38,760 --> 00:46:40,160
I do still at my heart.

2769
00:46:40,500 --> 00:46:41,280
And if a smart

2770
00:46:41,280 --> 00:46:42,080
young colonel

2771
00:46:42,080 --> 00:46:43,400
with five or 6000

2772
00:46:43,400 --> 00:46:43,880
a year

2773
00:46:43,880 --> 00:46:44,540
should want one

2774
00:46:44,540 --> 00:46:45,240
of my girls,

2775
00:46:45,240 --> 00:46:46,080
I shall not say

2776
00:46:46,080 --> 00:46:47,060
nay to him.

2777
00:46:47,060 --> 00:46:47,880
And I thought,

2778
00:46:47,880 --> 00:46:48,660
Colonel Force

2779
00:46:48,660 --> 00:46:49,820
looked very becoming

2780
00:46:49,820 --> 00:46:50,360
the other night

2781
00:46:50,360 --> 00:46:51,140
at the Williams

2782
00:46:51,140 --> 00:46:52,340
in his regimental

2783
00:46:53,120 --> 00:46:53,960
mama.

2784
00:46:53,960 --> 00:46:55,100
Cried Lydia.

2785
00:46:55,100 --> 00:46:55,700
My aunt.

2786
00:46:55,700 --> 00:46:56,400
Says that Colonel.

2787
00:46:56,400 --> 00:46:56,820
Foster

2788
00:46:56,820 --> 00:46:57,320
and Captain

2789
00:46:57,320 --> 00:46:58,100
Carter do not go

2790
00:46:58,100 --> 00:46:59,220
so often, Miss Watson's,

2791
00:46:59,220 --> 00:46:59,660
as they did

2792
00:46:59,660 --> 00:47:00,840
when they first came.

2793
00:47:00,840 --> 00:47:01,680
She sees them now,

2794
00:47:01,680 --> 00:47:02,280
very often,

2795
00:47:02,280 --> 00:47:02,780
standing in

2796
00:47:02,780 --> 00:47:03,980
Clark's library.

2797
00:47:04,220 --> 00:47:04,620
Mrs.

2798
00:47:04,620 --> 00:47:05,520
Bennett was prevented,

2799
00:47:05,520 --> 00:47:06,020
replying

2800
00:47:06,020 --> 00:47:06,660
by the entrance

2801
00:47:06,660 --> 00:47:07,280
of the footman

2802
00:47:07,280 --> 00:47:07,700
with a note

2803
00:47:07,700 --> 00:47:08,720
from Bennett.

2804
00:47:08,720 --> 00:47:09,380
It came from.

2805
00:47:09,380 --> 00:47:10,200
Netherfield,

2806
00:47:10,200 --> 00:47:10,920
and the servant

2807
00:47:10,920 --> 00:47:12,120
waited for an answer.

2808
00:47:12,500 --> 00:47:12,900
Mrs.

2809
00:47:12,900 --> 00:47:13,640
Bennett's eyes

2810
00:47:13,640 --> 00:47:14,820
sparkled with pleasure,

2811
00:47:14,820 --> 00:47:15,740
and she was eagerly

2812
00:47:15,740 --> 00:47:16,380
calling out

2813
00:47:16,380 --> 00:47:17,580
while her daughter read.

2814
00:47:17,780 --> 00:47:18,600
Well, Jane,

2815
00:47:18,600 --> 00:47:19,620
who is it from?

2816
00:47:19,620 --> 00:47:20,540
What is it about?

2817
00:47:20,540 --> 00:47:21,660
What does he say?

2818
00:47:21,660 --> 00:47:22,800
Well, Jane, make haste

2819
00:47:22,800 --> 00:47:23,360
and tell us.

2820
00:47:23,360 --> 00:47:24,660
Make haste, my love.

2821
00:47:25,500 --> 00:47:26,760
It is from Miss Bingley.

2822
00:47:27,020 --> 00:47:27,920
That Jane,

2823
00:47:27,920 --> 00:47:29,120
and then read it aloud.

2824
00:47:29,880 --> 00:47:31,080
My dear friend,

2825
00:47:31,400 --> 00:47:32,220
if you are not so

2826
00:47:32,220 --> 00:47:33,020
compassionate as.

2827
00:47:33,020 --> 00:47:33,840
To dine today with.

2828
00:47:33,840 --> 00:47:35,000
Louisa and me,

2829
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:36,000
we shall be in danger

2830
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:36,480
of hating.

2831
00:47:36,480 --> 00:47:36,800
Each other

2832
00:47:36,800 --> 00:47:37,260
for the rest

2833
00:47:37,260 --> 00:47:38,160
of our lives.

2834
00:47:38,160 --> 00:47:39,260
For a whole day's tete

2835
00:47:39,260 --> 00:47:40,580
a tete between two women

2836
00:47:40,820 --> 00:47:41,520
can never end

2837
00:47:41,520 --> 00:47:42,720
without a quarrel.

2838
00:47:42,720 --> 00:47:43,820
Come as soon as you can.

2839
00:47:43,820 --> 00:47:45,020
On receipt of this,

2840
00:47:45,020 --> 00:47:45,600
my brother

2841
00:47:45,600 --> 00:47:46,160
and the gentleman

2842
00:47:46,160 --> 00:47:46,620
out to dine

2843
00:47:46,620 --> 00:47:47,780
with the officers.

2844
00:47:47,780 --> 00:47:48,860
Josepha

2845
00:47:48,860 --> 00:47:50,060
Caroline Bingley

2846
00:47:50,700 --> 00:47:51,900
with the officer's,

2847
00:47:52,040 --> 00:47:53,100
cried Lydia.

2848
00:47:53,100 --> 00:47:53,640
I wonder.

2849
00:47:53,640 --> 00:47:53,940
My aunt

2850
00:47:53,940 --> 00:47:55,140
did not tell us at that

2851
00:47:55,800 --> 00:47:57,660
dining out, said Mrs.

2852
00:47:57,660 --> 00:47:58,380
Bennett.

2853
00:47:58,380 --> 00:48:00,200
That is very unlucky.

2854
00:48:00,980 --> 00:48:02,180
Can I have the carriage?

2855
00:48:02,460 --> 00:48:03,660
Said Jane.

2856
00:48:03,680 --> 00:48:04,760
No, my dear,

2857
00:48:04,760 --> 00:48:05,060
you had

2858
00:48:05,060 --> 00:48:06,260
better go on horseback

2859
00:48:06,360 --> 00:48:07,440
because it seems likely

2860
00:48:07,440 --> 00:48:08,040
to rain.

2861
00:48:08,040 --> 00:48:09,380
And then you must stay

2862
00:48:09,380 --> 00:48:10,580
all night.

2863
00:48:10,980 --> 00:48:11,640
And that would be

2864
00:48:11,640 --> 00:48:12,620
a good scheme.

2865
00:48:12,620 --> 00:48:12,900
Said.

2866
00:48:12,900 --> 00:48:13,740
Elizabeth.

2867
00:48:13,740 --> 00:48:14,100
If you.

2868
00:48:14,100 --> 00:48:14,520
Were sure

2869
00:48:14,520 --> 00:48:15,060
that they would not.

2870
00:48:15,060 --> 00:48:16,260
Offer to send her home.

2871
00:48:16,760 --> 00:48:17,280
Oh, but

2872
00:48:17,280 --> 00:48:17,880
the gentleman

2873
00:48:17,880 --> 00:48:18,480
will have Mr.

2874
00:48:18,480 --> 00:48:18,840
Bingley

2875
00:48:18,840 --> 00:48:20,180
Shays to go to Mountain

2876
00:48:20,340 --> 00:48:21,440
and the hosts have no

2877
00:48:21,440 --> 00:48:22,640
horses to theirs.

2878
00:48:23,400 --> 00:48:24,360
I had much rather

2879
00:48:24,360 --> 00:48:25,560
go in the coach.

2880
00:48:25,880 --> 00:48:26,700
But, my dear,

2881
00:48:26,700 --> 00:48:27,240
your father

2882
00:48:27,240 --> 00:48:28,440
cannot spare the horses.

2883
00:48:28,440 --> 00:48:29,580
I am sure they are

2884
00:48:29,580 --> 00:48:30,620
wanted in the fall, Mr.

2885
00:48:30,620 --> 00:48:31,820
Bennett, are they not?

2886
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:32,720
They are wanted

2887
00:48:32,720 --> 00:48:34,080
in the farm much oftener

2888
00:48:34,080 --> 00:48:35,280
than I can get them.

2889
00:48:35,520 --> 00:48:36,500
But if you have got them

2890
00:48:36,500 --> 00:48:38,000
today, said Elizabeth.

2891
00:48:38,300 --> 00:48:39,440
My mother's purpose

2892
00:48:39,440 --> 00:48:40,640
would be answered.

2893
00:48:41,160 --> 00:48:42,200
She did at last

2894
00:48:42,200 --> 00:48:43,400
extort from her father

2895
00:48:43,400 --> 00:48:44,120
an acknowledgment

2896
00:48:44,120 --> 00:48:44,780
that the horses

2897
00:48:44,780 --> 00:48:45,900
were engaged.

2898
00:48:45,900 --> 00:48:46,820
Jane was therefore

2899
00:48:46,820 --> 00:48:47,280
obliged

2900
00:48:47,280 --> 00:48:48,420
to go on horseback

2901
00:48:48,420 --> 00:48:49,080
and her mother

2902
00:48:49,080 --> 00:48:50,100
attended her to the door

2903
00:48:50,100 --> 00:48:50,880
with many cheerful

2904
00:48:50,880 --> 00:48:51,680
prognostic cause

2905
00:48:51,680 --> 00:48:52,880
of a bad day.

2906
00:48:52,980 --> 00:48:54,200
Her hopes were answered.

2907
00:48:54,500 --> 00:48:55,740
Jane had not been gone

2908
00:48:55,740 --> 00:48:56,340
long before

2909
00:48:56,340 --> 00:48:57,500
it rained hard.

2910
00:48:57,500 --> 00:48:58,160
Her sisters

2911
00:48:58,160 --> 00:48:59,360
were uneasy for her,

2912
00:48:59,360 --> 00:49:00,060
but her mother

2913
00:49:00,060 --> 00:49:01,220
was delighted.

2914
00:49:01,220 --> 00:49:02,160
The rain continued

2915
00:49:02,160 --> 00:49:02,840
the whole evening

2916
00:49:02,840 --> 00:49:03,960
without intermission.

2917
00:49:03,960 --> 00:49:04,860
Jane certainly

2918
00:49:04,860 --> 00:49:06,060
could not come back.

2919
00:49:06,560 --> 00:49:07,260
This was a

2920
00:49:07,260 --> 00:49:08,600
lucky idea of mine.

2921
00:49:08,600 --> 00:49:09,620
Indeed.

2922
00:49:09,620 --> 00:49:10,200
Said Mrs.

2923
00:49:10,200 --> 00:49:10,460
Bennett,

2924
00:49:10,460 --> 00:49:11,660
more than once, as if

2925
00:49:11,660 --> 00:49:12,080
the credit

2926
00:49:12,080 --> 00:49:12,900
of making it rain

2927
00:49:12,900 --> 00:49:14,100
were all her own.

2928
00:49:14,100 --> 00:49:15,000
Till the next morning,

2929
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:15,360
however,

2930
00:49:15,360 --> 00:49:16,080
she was not aware

2931
00:49:16,080 --> 00:49:16,820
of all the felicity

2932
00:49:16,820 --> 00:49:18,020
of her contrivance.

2933
00:49:18,060 --> 00:49:19,200
Breakfast was scarcely

2934
00:49:19,200 --> 00:49:19,980
over when a servant

2935
00:49:19,980 --> 00:49:20,640
from Netherfield

2936
00:49:20,640 --> 00:49:20,960
brought the

2937
00:49:20,960 --> 00:49:21,660
following note

2938
00:49:21,660 --> 00:49:22,860
for Elizabeth.

2939
00:49:23,180 --> 00:49:24,380
My dearest Lizzie.

2940
00:49:24,620 --> 00:49:25,440
I find myself

2941
00:49:25,440 --> 00:49:26,000
very unwell

2942
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:26,840
this morning.

2943
00:49:26,840 --> 00:49:27,840
Which I suppose is to.

2944
00:49:27,840 --> 00:49:28,340
Be imputed

2945
00:49:28,340 --> 00:49:29,060
to my getting wet

2946
00:49:29,060 --> 00:49:30,260
through yesterday.

2947
00:49:30,360 --> 00:49:31,200
My kind friends

2948
00:49:31,200 --> 00:49:31,740
will not hear

2949
00:49:31,740 --> 00:49:32,360
my returning.

2950
00:49:32,360 --> 00:49:33,540
To lie in. Better.

2951
00:49:33,540 --> 00:49:34,080
They insist

2952
00:49:34,080 --> 00:49:35,180
also on my seeing Mr.

2953
00:49:35,180 --> 00:49:36,020
Jones.

2954
00:49:36,020 --> 00:49:36,540
Therefore,

2955
00:49:36,540 --> 00:49:37,380
do not be alarmed

2956
00:49:37,380 --> 00:49:37,880
if you should hear

2957
00:49:37,880 --> 00:49:38,180
of his

2958
00:49:38,180 --> 00:49:39,380
having been to see me

2959
00:49:39,480 --> 00:49:40,140
and excepting

2960
00:49:40,140 --> 00:49:40,740
a sore throat

2961
00:49:40,740 --> 00:49:41,520
and headache.

2962
00:49:41,520 --> 00:49:42,260
There is not much

2963
00:49:42,260 --> 00:49:43,440
the matter with me,

2964
00:49:43,440 --> 00:49:44,420
yours, etc..

2965
00:49:46,620 --> 00:49:47,820
Well, my dear.

2966
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:48,500
Said Mr.

2967
00:49:48,500 --> 00:49:48,860
Bennett,

2968
00:49:48,860 --> 00:49:49,700
when Elizabeth had read

2969
00:49:49,700 --> 00:49:50,540
the note aloud.

2970
00:49:50,540 --> 00:49:51,420
If your daughter

2971
00:49:51,420 --> 00:49:51,800
should have

2972
00:49:51,800 --> 00:49:52,440
a dangerous

2973
00:49:52,440 --> 00:49:53,340
fit of illness,

2974
00:49:53,340 --> 00:49:54,540
if she should die,

2975
00:49:54,660 --> 00:49:55,760
it would be a comfort

2976
00:49:55,760 --> 00:49:56,160
to know

2977
00:49:56,160 --> 00:49:56,540
that it was

2978
00:49:56,540 --> 00:49:58,020
all in pursuit of Mr.

2979
00:49:58,020 --> 00:49:58,800
Bingley

2980
00:49:58,800 --> 00:50:00,140
and under your orders.

2981
00:50:01,160 --> 00:50:02,040
Oh, I am not

2982
00:50:02,040 --> 00:50:03,320
afraid of her dying

2983
00:50:03,600 --> 00:50:04,620
People do not die

2984
00:50:04,620 --> 00:50:04,920
of little

2985
00:50:04,920 --> 00:50:06,120
trifling colds.

2986
00:50:06,320 --> 00:50:07,100
She would be taken

2987
00:50:07,100 --> 00:50:08,180
good care of.

2988
00:50:08,180 --> 00:50:09,260
As long as she stays.

2989
00:50:09,260 --> 00:50:09,440
There.

2990
00:50:09,440 --> 00:50:10,640
It is all very well.

2991
00:50:10,740 --> 00:50:11,760
I would go and see her

2992
00:50:11,760 --> 00:50:12,200
if I could have

2993
00:50:12,200 --> 00:50:13,400
the carriage.

2994
00:50:13,580 --> 00:50:14,280
Elizabeth,

2995
00:50:14,280 --> 00:50:15,540
feeling really anxious,

2996
00:50:15,680 --> 00:50:16,340
was determined

2997
00:50:16,340 --> 00:50:16,940
to go to her,

2998
00:50:16,940 --> 00:50:17,520
though the carriage

2999
00:50:17,520 --> 00:50:18,720
was not to be had.

3000
00:50:18,800 --> 00:50:19,800
And as she was, no,

3001
00:50:19,800 --> 00:50:21,080
horsewoman walking

3002
00:50:21,080 --> 00:50:21,360
was her

3003
00:50:21,360 --> 00:50:22,560
only alternative.

3004
00:50:22,620 --> 00:50:23,300
She declared

3005
00:50:23,300 --> 00:50:24,500
her resolution.

3006
00:50:24,680 --> 00:50:25,640
How can you be

3007
00:50:25,640 --> 00:50:26,840
so silly?

3008
00:50:26,900 --> 00:50:27,960
Cried her mother.

3009
00:50:27,960 --> 00:50:28,680
As to think of

3010
00:50:28,680 --> 00:50:29,180
such a thing

3011
00:50:29,180 --> 00:50:30,360
in all this dirt.

3012
00:50:30,360 --> 00:50:31,280
You will not be fit

3013
00:50:31,280 --> 00:50:31,920
to be seen

3014
00:50:31,920 --> 00:50:33,120
when you get there.

3015
00:50:33,380 --> 00:50:34,140
I shall be very

3016
00:50:34,140 --> 00:50:34,940
fit to see Jane,

3017
00:50:34,940 --> 00:50:36,140
which is all I want.

3018
00:50:36,660 --> 00:50:37,640
Is this a hint to me,

3019
00:50:37,640 --> 00:50:38,420
Lizzie?

3020
00:50:38,420 --> 00:50:39,420
Said her father.

3021
00:50:39,420 --> 00:50:40,620
To send for the horses.

3022
00:50:41,040 --> 00:50:42,020
No, indeed.

3023
00:50:42,020 --> 00:50:43,100
I do not wish to avoid.

3024
00:50:43,100 --> 00:50:43,820
The walk.

3025
00:50:43,820 --> 00:50:44,840
The distance is nothing.

3026
00:50:44,840 --> 00:50:45,920
When one has a motive.

3027
00:50:45,920 --> 00:50:47,120
Only three miles.

3028
00:50:47,180 --> 00:50:47,640
I shall be

3029
00:50:47,640 --> 00:50:48,660
back by dinner.

3030
00:50:49,680 --> 00:50:51,120
I admire the activity

3031
00:50:51,120 --> 00:50:52,260
of you and evidence,

3032
00:50:52,260 --> 00:50:53,460
observed Mary.

3033
00:50:53,520 --> 00:50:54,680
But every impulse,

3034
00:50:54,680 --> 00:50:55,100
a feeling,

3035
00:50:55,100 --> 00:50:55,800
should be guided

3036
00:50:55,800 --> 00:50:56,880
by reason.

3037
00:50:56,880 --> 00:50:57,840
And in my opinion,

3038
00:50:57,840 --> 00:50:58,280
exertion

3039
00:50:58,280 --> 00:50:58,820
should always

3040
00:50:58,820 --> 00:51:00,000
be in proportion to

3041
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:01,200
what is required.

3042
00:51:01,700 --> 00:51:02,180
We would go

3043
00:51:02,180 --> 00:51:02,960
as far as merit.

3044
00:51:02,960 --> 00:51:04,040
And with you, said

3045
00:51:04,040 --> 00:51:05,240
Catherine and Lydia.

3046
00:51:05,400 --> 00:51:05,900
Elizabeth

3047
00:51:05,900 --> 00:51:07,100
accepted their company

3048
00:51:07,220 --> 00:51:07,740
and the three

3049
00:51:07,740 --> 00:51:08,300
young ladies

3050
00:51:08,300 --> 00:51:09,500
set off together.

3051
00:51:09,980 --> 00:51:11,240
If we make haste.

3052
00:51:11,400 --> 00:51:12,000
Said Lydia,

3053
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:13,160
as they walked along,

3054
00:51:13,160 --> 00:51:14,100
perhaps you may see

3055
00:51:14,100 --> 00:51:14,880
something of Captain.

3056
00:51:14,880 --> 00:51:16,080
Carter before he goes.

3057
00:51:16,860 --> 00:51:17,060
In.

3058
00:51:17,060 --> 00:51:18,260
Merritt and they parted.

3059
00:51:18,380 --> 00:51:19,160
The two youngest

3060
00:51:19,160 --> 00:51:20,120
repaired to the lodgings

3061
00:51:20,120 --> 00:51:20,420
of one of

3062
00:51:20,420 --> 00:51:21,620
the officer's wives.

3063
00:51:21,720 --> 00:51:22,380
And Elizabeth

3064
00:51:22,380 --> 00:51:22,880
continued her

3065
00:51:22,880 --> 00:51:24,300
walk alone, crossing

3066
00:51:24,300 --> 00:51:24,920
field after

3067
00:51:24,920 --> 00:51:26,120
field at a quick pace,

3068
00:51:26,180 --> 00:51:27,360
jumping over styles

3069
00:51:27,360 --> 00:51:27,900
and springing

3070
00:51:27,900 --> 00:51:28,500
over puddles

3071
00:51:28,500 --> 00:51:29,720
with impatient activity.

3072
00:51:30,060 --> 00:51:30,620
And finding.

3073
00:51:30,620 --> 00:51:31,680
Herself at last within

3074
00:51:31,680 --> 00:51:32,600
view of the house

3075
00:51:32,600 --> 00:51:33,800
with weary ankles,

3076
00:51:33,800 --> 00:51:34,980
dirty stockings

3077
00:51:34,980 --> 00:51:36,020
and a face glowing

3078
00:51:36,020 --> 00:51:36,620
with the warmth

3079
00:51:36,620 --> 00:51:37,820
of exercise.

3080
00:51:38,160 --> 00:51:38,480
She was.

3081
00:51:38,480 --> 00:51:39,020
Shown into the

3082
00:51:39,020 --> 00:51:39,980
breakfast parlor

3083
00:51:39,980 --> 00:51:40,560
where all but

3084
00:51:40,560 --> 00:51:41,760
Jane were assembled

3085
00:51:41,760 --> 00:51:42,800
and where her appearance

3086
00:51:42,800 --> 00:51:43,220
created

3087
00:51:43,220 --> 00:51:43,940
a great deal

3088
00:51:43,940 --> 00:51:45,060
of surprise.

3089
00:51:45,060 --> 00:51:45,620
That she should

3090
00:51:45,620 --> 00:51:46,140
have walked.

3091
00:51:46,140 --> 00:51:46,880
Three miles

3092
00:51:46,880 --> 00:51:48,080
so early in the day

3093
00:51:48,200 --> 00:51:49,440
in such dirty weather

3094
00:51:49,440 --> 00:51:51,060
and by herself was.

3095
00:51:51,060 --> 00:51:51,500
Almost.

3096
00:51:51,500 --> 00:51:52,580
Incredible to Mrs.

3097
00:51:52,580 --> 00:51:53,300
Hurst and Mrs.

3098
00:51:53,300 --> 00:51:54,140
Bingley.

3099
00:51:54,140 --> 00:51:54,780
And Elizabeth

3100
00:51:54,780 --> 00:51:55,320
was convinced

3101
00:51:55,320 --> 00:51:55,880
that they held her

3102
00:51:55,880 --> 00:51:57,080
in contempt for it.

3103
00:51:57,360 --> 00:51:58,200
She was received.

3104
00:51:58,200 --> 00:51:58,560
However,

3105
00:51:58,560 --> 00:51:59,760
very politely by them

3106
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:00,800
and in their brothers

3107
00:52:00,800 --> 00:52:01,260
manners.

3108
00:52:01,260 --> 00:52:01,820
There was something

3109
00:52:01,820 --> 00:52:03,020
better than politeness.

3110
00:52:03,080 --> 00:52:03,620
There was good

3111
00:52:03,620 --> 00:52:05,040
humor and kindness.

3112
00:52:05,580 --> 00:52:05,940
Mr.

3113
00:52:05,940 --> 00:52:07,200
Darcy said Very little.

3114
00:52:07,380 --> 00:52:07,860
And Mr.

3115
00:52:07,860 --> 00:52:09,120
Hurst, nothing at all.

3116
00:52:09,540 --> 00:52:10,580
The former was divided

3117
00:52:10,580 --> 00:52:11,460
between admiration

3118
00:52:11,460 --> 00:52:12,200
of the brilliancy,

3119
00:52:12,200 --> 00:52:12,960
which exercise

3120
00:52:12,960 --> 00:52:13,320
had given

3121
00:52:13,320 --> 00:52:14,300
to her complexion

3122
00:52:14,300 --> 00:52:15,080
and doubt

3123
00:52:15,080 --> 00:52:16,040
as to the occasions

3124
00:52:16,040 --> 00:52:16,760
justifying her

3125
00:52:16,760 --> 00:52:17,960
coming so far alone.

3126
00:52:18,420 --> 00:52:19,520
The latter was thinking

3127
00:52:19,520 --> 00:52:20,760
only of his breakfast.

3128
00:52:21,740 --> 00:52:22,400
Her inquiries

3129
00:52:22,400 --> 00:52:22,740
after her

3130
00:52:22,740 --> 00:52:23,660
sister were not very

3131
00:52:23,660 --> 00:52:24,860
favorably answered.

3132
00:52:24,900 --> 00:52:25,560
Miss Bennett

3133
00:52:25,560 --> 00:52:26,600
had slept ill,

3134
00:52:26,600 --> 00:52:27,060
and though

3135
00:52:27,060 --> 00:52:28,440
up was very feverish.

3136
00:52:28,560 --> 00:52:29,060
And not.

3137
00:52:29,060 --> 00:52:29,760
Well enough to leave

3138
00:52:29,760 --> 00:52:30,720
her room.

3139
00:52:30,720 --> 00:52:31,680
Elizabeth was glad

3140
00:52:31,680 --> 00:52:32,180
to be taken

3141
00:52:32,180 --> 00:52:33,380
to her immediately.

3142
00:52:33,380 --> 00:52:34,280
And Jane,

3143
00:52:34,280 --> 00:52:34,760
who had only

3144
00:52:34,760 --> 00:52:35,340
been withheld

3145
00:52:35,340 --> 00:52:35,780
by the fear

3146
00:52:35,780 --> 00:52:36,440
of giving alarm

3147
00:52:36,440 --> 00:52:37,160
or inconvenience

3148
00:52:37,160 --> 00:52:37,700
or expressing

3149
00:52:37,700 --> 00:52:38,120
in her note

3150
00:52:38,120 --> 00:52:38,840
how much she longed

3151
00:52:38,840 --> 00:52:39,800
for such a visit.

3152
00:52:39,800 --> 00:52:40,520
Was delighted

3153
00:52:40,520 --> 00:52:41,720
at her entrance.

3154
00:52:41,760 --> 00:52:42,320
She was not.

3155
00:52:42,320 --> 00:52:43,040
Equal, however,

3156
00:52:43,040 --> 00:52:44,240
to much conversation.

3157
00:52:44,420 --> 00:52:45,380
And when Miss Bingley

3158
00:52:45,380 --> 00:52:46,440
left them together

3159
00:52:46,440 --> 00:52:46,980
could attempt

3160
00:52:46,980 --> 00:52:47,300
little

3161
00:52:47,300 --> 00:52:48,260
besides expressions

3162
00:52:48,260 --> 00:52:48,920
of gratitude

3163
00:52:48,920 --> 00:52:49,200
for the

3164
00:52:49,200 --> 00:52:50,280
extraordinary kindness

3165
00:52:50,280 --> 00:52:51,480
she was treated with.

3166
00:52:51,480 --> 00:52:52,560
Elizabeth silently

3167
00:52:52,560 --> 00:52:53,760
attended her.

3168
00:52:54,120 --> 00:52:55,200
When breakfast was over,

3169
00:52:55,200 --> 00:52:55,740
they were joined

3170
00:52:55,740 --> 00:52:56,700
by the sisters.

3171
00:52:56,700 --> 00:52:57,680
And Elizabeth began

3172
00:52:57,680 --> 00:52:58,880
to like them herself.

3173
00:52:58,920 --> 00:52:59,600
When she saw how.

3174
00:52:59,600 --> 00:53:00,320
Much affection

3175
00:53:00,320 --> 00:53:00,980
and solicitude

3176
00:53:00,980 --> 00:53:02,180
they showed for Jane.

3177
00:53:02,420 --> 00:53:03,620
The apothecary came

3178
00:53:03,840 --> 00:53:04,680
had, having examined

3179
00:53:04,680 --> 00:53:05,600
his patient,

3180
00:53:05,600 --> 00:53:06,200
said, as

3181
00:53:06,200 --> 00:53:07,160
might be supposed.

3182
00:53:07,160 --> 00:53:07,520
That she.

3183
00:53:07,520 --> 00:53:07,940
Had caught

3184
00:53:07,940 --> 00:53:09,060
a violent cold

3185
00:53:09,060 --> 00:53:09,380
and that

3186
00:53:09,380 --> 00:53:10,200
they must endeavor

3187
00:53:10,200 --> 00:53:11,400
to get the better of it.

3188
00:53:11,600 --> 00:53:12,260
Advise her

3189
00:53:12,260 --> 00:53:13,260
to return to bed

3190
00:53:13,260 --> 00:53:14,040
and promised her

3191
00:53:14,040 --> 00:53:15,080
some drafts.

3192
00:53:15,080 --> 00:53:16,140
The advice was followed

3193
00:53:16,140 --> 00:53:16,740
readily

3194
00:53:16,740 --> 00:53:17,000
for the

3195
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:17,900
feverish symptoms

3196
00:53:17,900 --> 00:53:19,140
increased and her head

3197
00:53:19,140 --> 00:53:20,340
ached acutely.

3198
00:53:20,360 --> 00:53:21,320
Elizabeth did not

3199
00:53:21,320 --> 00:53:21,840
quit her room

3200
00:53:21,840 --> 00:53:22,740
for a moment.

3201
00:53:22,740 --> 00:53:23,240
Nor were the

3202
00:53:23,240 --> 00:53:23,780
other ladies

3203
00:53:23,780 --> 00:53:24,900
often absent.

3204
00:53:24,900 --> 00:53:26,100
The gentleman being out,

3205
00:53:26,220 --> 00:53:27,180
they had in fact,

3206
00:53:27,180 --> 00:53:28,460
nothing to do elsewhere.

3207
00:53:29,420 --> 00:53:30,020
When the clock

3208
00:53:30,020 --> 00:53:30,720
struck three,

3209
00:53:30,720 --> 00:53:31,400
Elizabeth felt

3210
00:53:31,400 --> 00:53:32,420
that she must go

3211
00:53:32,420 --> 00:53:33,480
and very unwillingly

3212
00:53:33,480 --> 00:53:34,520
said so.

3213
00:53:34,520 --> 00:53:35,180
Miss Bingley

3214
00:53:35,180 --> 00:53:36,320
offered her the carriage

3215
00:53:36,320 --> 00:53:37,220
and she only wanted

3216
00:53:37,220 --> 00:53:37,940
a little pressing

3217
00:53:37,940 --> 00:53:39,000
to accept it.

3218
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:40,100
When Jane testified,

3219
00:53:40,100 --> 00:53:40,820
such concern

3220
00:53:40,820 --> 00:53:41,820
in parting with her

3221
00:53:41,820 --> 00:53:42,560
that Miss Bingley

3222
00:53:42,560 --> 00:53:43,040
was obliged

3223
00:53:43,040 --> 00:53:43,460
to convert

3224
00:53:43,460 --> 00:53:44,660
the offer of the shares

3225
00:53:44,660 --> 00:53:45,440
to an invitation

3226
00:53:45,440 --> 00:53:45,860
to remain

3227
00:53:45,860 --> 00:53:46,440
at Netherfield

3228
00:53:46,440 --> 00:53:47,460
for the present,

3229
00:53:47,460 --> 00:53:48,260
Elizabeth most

3230
00:53:48,260 --> 00:53:49,460
thankfully, consented,

3231
00:53:49,640 --> 00:53:50,220
and a servant

3232
00:53:50,220 --> 00:53:50,840
was dispatched

3233
00:53:50,840 --> 00:53:51,420
along, born

3234
00:53:51,420 --> 00:53:52,280
to acquaint the family

3235
00:53:52,280 --> 00:53:52,520
with her

3236
00:53:52,520 --> 00:53:54,000
stay and bring back

3237
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:55,260
a supply of clothes.

3238
00:53:56,840 --> 00:53:58,040
Chapter eight.

3239
00:53:59,360 --> 00:54:00,300
At 5:00,

3240
00:54:00,300 --> 00:54:01,040
the two ladies

3241
00:54:01,040 --> 00:54:02,240
retired to dress,

3242
00:54:02,280 --> 00:54:03,740
and at 6:30,

3243
00:54:03,740 --> 00:54:04,880
Elizabeth was summoned

3244
00:54:04,880 --> 00:54:05,960
to dinner

3245
00:54:05,960 --> 00:54:07,200
to the civil inquiries,

3246
00:54:07,200 --> 00:54:08,400
which then poured in,

3247
00:54:08,420 --> 00:54:09,020
and amongst

3248
00:54:09,020 --> 00:54:09,620
which she had

3249
00:54:09,620 --> 00:54:10,100
the pleasure

3250
00:54:10,100 --> 00:54:10,820
of distinguishing

3251
00:54:10,820 --> 00:54:11,780
the much superior

3252
00:54:11,780 --> 00:54:12,680
solicitude of Mr.

3253
00:54:12,680 --> 00:54:13,520
Bingley.

3254
00:54:13,520 --> 00:54:14,340
She could not make

3255
00:54:14,340 --> 00:54:15,740
a very favorable answer.

3256
00:54:16,160 --> 00:54:16,940
Jane was by

3257
00:54:16,940 --> 00:54:18,140
no means better.

3258
00:54:18,560 --> 00:54:19,340
The sisters,

3259
00:54:19,340 --> 00:54:20,760
on hearing this repeated

3260
00:54:20,760 --> 00:54:21,740
three or four times,

3261
00:54:21,740 --> 00:54:22,400
how much they

3262
00:54:22,400 --> 00:54:23,180
were grieved,

3263
00:54:23,180 --> 00:54:24,320
how shocking it was

3264
00:54:24,320 --> 00:54:25,700
to have a bad cold, and.

3265
00:54:25,700 --> 00:54:26,600
How excessively.

3266
00:54:26,600 --> 00:54:27,260
They disliked

3267
00:54:27,260 --> 00:54:28,520
being ill themselves

3268
00:54:28,920 --> 00:54:29,780
and then thought no

3269
00:54:29,780 --> 00:54:30,920
more of the matter

3270
00:54:30,920 --> 00:54:31,440
and their

3271
00:54:31,440 --> 00:54:31,940
indifference

3272
00:54:31,940 --> 00:54:32,700
towards Jane

3273
00:54:32,700 --> 00:54:33,440
when not immediately

3274
00:54:33,440 --> 00:54:34,340
before them

3275
00:54:34,340 --> 00:54:35,300
restored Elizabeth

3276
00:54:35,300 --> 00:54:36,060
to the enjoyment

3277
00:54:36,060 --> 00:54:36,480
of all

3278
00:54:36,480 --> 00:54:37,680
her former dislike.

3279
00:54:38,340 --> 00:54:39,420
Their brother indeed

3280
00:54:39,420 --> 00:54:39,960
was the only

3281
00:54:39,960 --> 00:54:40,700
one of the party

3282
00:54:40,700 --> 00:54:41,460
whom she could regard

3283
00:54:41,460 --> 00:54:42,740
with any complacency.

3284
00:54:43,160 --> 00:54:44,180
His anxiety for

3285
00:54:44,180 --> 00:54:45,380
Jane was evident

3286
00:54:45,380 --> 00:54:46,200
and his attentions

3287
00:54:46,200 --> 00:54:46,820
to herself

3288
00:54:46,820 --> 00:54:48,000
most pleasing,

3289
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:48,860
and they prevented her

3290
00:54:48,860 --> 00:54:49,620
feeling herself

3291
00:54:49,620 --> 00:54:50,600
so much an intruder

3292
00:54:50,600 --> 00:54:51,200
as she believed

3293
00:54:51,200 --> 00:54:51,980
she was considered

3294
00:54:51,980 --> 00:54:53,180
by the others.

3295
00:54:53,240 --> 00:54:53,880
She had very

3296
00:54:53,880 --> 00:54:54,500
little notice

3297
00:54:54,500 --> 00:54:55,700
from any but him.

3298
00:54:55,820 --> 00:54:56,460
Miss Bingley

3299
00:54:56,460 --> 00:54:57,440
was engrossed by Mr.

3300
00:54:57,440 --> 00:54:58,220
Darcy,

3301
00:54:58,220 --> 00:54:59,600
her sister scarcely less

3302
00:54:59,600 --> 00:55:01,020
so, and asked for Mr.

3303
00:55:01,020 --> 00:55:01,680
Hirst,

3304
00:55:01,680 --> 00:55:03,000
by whom Elizabeth sat.

3305
00:55:03,300 --> 00:55:04,700
He was an indolent man

3306
00:55:04,920 --> 00:55:05,400
who lived.

3307
00:55:05,400 --> 00:55:06,480
Only to eat.

3308
00:55:06,480 --> 00:55:08,040
Drink and play at cards.

3309
00:55:08,420 --> 00:55:09,440
Who, when he found her

3310
00:55:09,440 --> 00:55:10,340
to prefer a plain

3311
00:55:10,340 --> 00:55:11,540
dish to a ragout,

3312
00:55:11,600 --> 00:55:12,720
had nothing to say

3313
00:55:12,720 --> 00:55:13,580
to her.

3314
00:55:13,580 --> 00:55:14,780
When dinner was over,

3315
00:55:14,780 --> 00:55:15,480
she returned

3316
00:55:15,480 --> 00:55:16,680
directly to Jane

3317
00:55:16,680 --> 00:55:17,120
and Ms..

3318
00:55:17,120 --> 00:55:17,840
Bingley began

3319
00:55:17,840 --> 00:55:18,540
abusing her.

3320
00:55:18,540 --> 00:55:19,160
As soon as she was

3321
00:55:19,160 --> 00:55:20,220
out of the. Room.

3322
00:55:20,220 --> 00:55:20,840
Her manners

3323
00:55:20,840 --> 00:55:21,360
were pronounced

3324
00:55:21,360 --> 00:55:22,760
to be very bad indeed.

3325
00:55:22,940 --> 00:55:24,180
A mixture of pride

3326
00:55:24,180 --> 00:55:25,340
and impertinence.

3327
00:55:25,340 --> 00:55:26,820
She had no conversation,

3328
00:55:26,960 --> 00:55:28,860
no style, no beauty.

3329
00:55:29,240 --> 00:55:30,020
Mrs.

3330
00:55:30,020 --> 00:55:30,240
thought

3331
00:55:30,240 --> 00:55:31,440
the same and added.

3332
00:55:31,740 --> 00:55:33,360
She has nothing in short

3333
00:55:33,360 --> 00:55:34,520
to recommend her.

3334
00:55:34,520 --> 00:55:36,120
But being an excellent

3335
00:55:36,140 --> 00:55:37,340
walker,

3336
00:55:37,380 --> 00:55:38,760
I shall never forget

3337
00:55:38,760 --> 00:55:39,420
to her parents.

3338
00:55:39,420 --> 00:55:40,280
This morning,

3339
00:55:40,280 --> 00:55:41,100
she really looked

3340
00:55:41,100 --> 00:55:42,480
almost wild.

3341
00:55:43,220 --> 00:55:43,880
Oh, she did

3342
00:55:43,880 --> 00:55:45,120
indeed, Louisa.

3343
00:55:45,440 --> 00:55:46,560
I could hardly keep

3344
00:55:46,560 --> 00:55:47,760
my countenance.

3345
00:55:47,880 --> 00:55:49,200
Very nonsensical

3346
00:55:49,200 --> 00:55:50,400
to come at all.

3347
00:55:50,420 --> 00:55:51,600
Why must she

3348
00:55:51,600 --> 00:55:52,500
be scampering

3349
00:55:52,500 --> 00:55:53,580
about the country?

3350
00:55:53,580 --> 00:55:54,060
Because her

3351
00:55:54,060 --> 00:55:55,320
sister had a cold,

3352
00:55:55,640 --> 00:55:57,780
her hair so untidy,

3353
00:55:57,780 --> 00:55:59,240
so blousy.

3354
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:00,900
Oh, yes.

3355
00:56:00,900 --> 00:56:02,160
And a petticoat.

3356
00:56:02,420 --> 00:56:03,420
I hope you saw her

3357
00:56:03,420 --> 00:56:04,920
petticoat six

3358
00:56:04,920 --> 00:56:06,480
inches deep in mud.

3359
00:56:06,700 --> 00:56:08,420
I'm absolutely certain.

3360
00:56:08,660 --> 00:56:09,540
And the gown

3361
00:56:09,540 --> 00:56:09,780
which had

3362
00:56:09,780 --> 00:56:11,040
been let down to hide

3363
00:56:11,040 --> 00:56:12,480
it not doing its office.

3364
00:56:13,260 --> 00:56:14,120
Your picture may

3365
00:56:14,120 --> 00:56:15,360
be very exact, Louisa,

3366
00:56:15,660 --> 00:56:16,620
said Bingley.

3367
00:56:16,620 --> 00:56:17,660
But this was all lost

3368
00:56:17,660 --> 00:56:18,860
upon me.

3369
00:56:18,920 --> 00:56:19,940
I thought Miss Elizabeth

3370
00:56:19,940 --> 00:56:21,200
Bennet looked remarkably

3371
00:56:21,200 --> 00:56:21,960
well when she came

3372
00:56:21,960 --> 00:56:22,500
into the room

3373
00:56:22,500 --> 00:56:23,060
this morning.

3374
00:56:24,320 --> 00:56:24,800
Her dirty

3375
00:56:24,800 --> 00:56:25,560
petticoat quite

3376
00:56:25,560 --> 00:56:26,760
escaped my notice.

3377
00:56:27,400 --> 00:56:28,880
You observed it, Mr.

3378
00:56:28,880 --> 00:56:29,720
Darcy?

3379
00:56:29,720 --> 00:56:30,920
I'm sure,

3380
00:56:31,160 --> 00:56:32,360
said Miss Bingley,

3381
00:56:32,600 --> 00:56:33,660
and I am inclined

3382
00:56:33,660 --> 00:56:34,200
to think

3383
00:56:34,200 --> 00:56:35,060
that you would not wish

3384
00:56:35,060 --> 00:56:36,300
to see your sister

3385
00:56:36,300 --> 00:56:38,040
make such an exhibition.

3386
00:56:39,140 --> 00:56:39,600
Certainly

3387
00:56:39,600 --> 00:56:42,480
not to walk three miles

3388
00:56:42,480 --> 00:56:43,820
or four miles

3389
00:56:43,820 --> 00:56:45,240
or five miles, whatever

3390
00:56:45,240 --> 00:56:46,260
it is, above her

3391
00:56:46,260 --> 00:56:47,460
ankles in dirt.

3392
00:56:47,480 --> 00:56:48,620
And to learn one

3393
00:56:48,620 --> 00:56:49,820
quite alone.

3394
00:56:50,180 --> 00:56:51,480
What could she mean

3395
00:56:51,480 --> 00:56:52,520
by it?

3396
00:56:52,520 --> 00:56:53,640
It seems to me

3397
00:56:53,640 --> 00:56:54,020
to show

3398
00:56:54,020 --> 00:56:55,140
an abominable, sort

3399
00:56:55,140 --> 00:56:55,820
of conceited

3400
00:56:55,820 --> 00:56:56,860
independence.

3401
00:56:56,860 --> 00:56:58,280
Her most country town

3402
00:56:58,280 --> 00:56:59,760
indifference to decorum.

3403
00:57:00,560 --> 00:57:01,700
It shows an affection

3404
00:57:01,700 --> 00:57:02,400
for her sister.

3405
00:57:02,400 --> 00:57:03,600
That is very pleasing.

3406
00:57:04,100 --> 00:57:05,300
Said Bingley.

3407
00:57:05,640 --> 00:57:07,340
I am afraid, Mr.

3408
00:57:07,340 --> 00:57:08,460
Darcy.

3409
00:57:08,460 --> 00:57:09,600
Observed Miss Bingley

3410
00:57:09,600 --> 00:57:10,800
in a half, whisper.

3411
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:11,400
That this.

3412
00:57:11,400 --> 00:57:12,000
Adventure

3413
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:13,020
has rather affected.

3414
00:57:13,020 --> 00:57:13,920
Your admiration

3415
00:57:13,920 --> 00:57:15,540
of her fine eyes.

3416
00:57:16,040 --> 00:57:17,120
Not at all.

3417
00:57:17,120 --> 00:57:18,000
He replied.

3418
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:18,860
They were brightened

3419
00:57:18,860 --> 00:57:20,060
by the exercise.

3420
00:57:20,600 --> 00:57:21,360
A short pause

3421
00:57:21,360 --> 00:57:22,260
followed the speech,

3422
00:57:22,260 --> 00:57:22,680
and Mrs.

3423
00:57:22,680 --> 00:57:23,880
Hurst began again.

3424
00:57:24,560 --> 00:57:25,140
I have an

3425
00:57:25,140 --> 00:57:26,180
excessive regard

3426
00:57:26,180 --> 00:57:27,380
for Miss Jane Bennet.

3427
00:57:27,480 --> 00:57:28,160
She is really a

3428
00:57:28,160 --> 00:57:29,400
very sweet girl,

3429
00:57:29,580 --> 00:57:30,200
and I wish

3430
00:57:30,200 --> 00:57:31,580
with all my heart

3431
00:57:31,580 --> 00:57:32,780
she be well settled.

3432
00:57:33,200 --> 00:57:34,400
But with such a.

3433
00:57:34,400 --> 00:57:35,240
Father and.

3434
00:57:35,240 --> 00:57:36,600
Mother in such

3435
00:57:36,600 --> 00:57:37,800
low connections.

3436
00:57:38,180 --> 00:57:39,060
I am afraid there is

3437
00:57:39,060 --> 00:57:40,260
no chance of it.

3438
00:57:40,820 --> 00:57:41,840
I think I've heard

3439
00:57:41,840 --> 00:57:42,420
you say that

3440
00:57:42,420 --> 00:57:42,960
their uncle

3441
00:57:42,960 --> 00:57:43,760
is an attorney

3442
00:57:43,760 --> 00:57:44,960
in Meriton.

3443
00:57:45,300 --> 00:57:46,340
Yes.

3444
00:57:46,340 --> 00:57:47,540
And they have another

3445
00:57:47,700 --> 00:57:48,960
who lives somewhere near

3446
00:57:48,960 --> 00:57:50,160
Cheapside.

3447
00:57:50,640 --> 00:57:51,840
That is capital.

3448
00:57:52,040 --> 00:57:53,240
Added her sister,

3449
00:57:53,280 --> 00:57:54,440
and they both laughed

3450
00:57:54,440 --> 00:57:55,580
heartily.

3451
00:57:55,580 --> 00:57:56,600
If they had uncles

3452
00:57:56,600 --> 00:57:57,420
enough to fill

3453
00:57:57,420 --> 00:57:58,620
all Cheapside.

3454
00:57:58,680 --> 00:57:59,880
Cried Bingley.

3455
00:58:00,020 --> 00:58:00,960
It would not make them

3456
00:58:00,960 --> 00:58:02,240
one jot less agreeable.

3457
00:58:02,780 --> 00:58:03,600
But it must very

3458
00:58:03,600 --> 00:58:04,680
materially lessen

3459
00:58:04,680 --> 00:58:05,180
their chance

3460
00:58:05,180 --> 00:58:06,380
of marrying men of any

3461
00:58:06,380 --> 00:58:07,220
consideration in

3462
00:58:07,220 --> 00:58:07,680
the world.

3463
00:58:09,060 --> 00:58:10,260
Replied Darcy

3464
00:58:10,680 --> 00:58:11,540
to this speech,

3465
00:58:11,540 --> 00:58:12,740
Bingley made no answer,

3466
00:58:12,980 --> 00:58:14,160
but his sisters gave it

3467
00:58:14,160 --> 00:58:15,360
their hearty assent

3468
00:58:15,440 --> 00:58:16,200
and indulged

3469
00:58:16,200 --> 00:58:16,700
their mirth.

3470
00:58:16,700 --> 00:58:17,520
For some

3471
00:58:17,520 --> 00:58:18,180
at the expense

3472
00:58:18,180 --> 00:58:19,200
of their dear friends.

3473
00:58:19,200 --> 00:58:20,400
Vulgar relations

3474
00:58:22,440 --> 00:58:23,160
with a renewal

3475
00:58:23,160 --> 00:58:24,360
of tenderness, however.

3476
00:58:24,480 --> 00:58:25,020
They returned

3477
00:58:25,020 --> 00:58:25,580
to her room

3478
00:58:25,580 --> 00:58:26,060
on leaving the

3479
00:58:26,060 --> 00:58:27,120
dining parlor

3480
00:58:27,120 --> 00:58:27,960
and sat with her

3481
00:58:27,960 --> 00:58:29,160
till summoned to coffee.

3482
00:58:29,340 --> 00:58:29,720
She was

3483
00:58:29,720 --> 00:58:30,920
still very poorly,

3484
00:58:31,020 --> 00:58:31,680
and Elizabeth

3485
00:58:31,680 --> 00:58:32,000
would not

3486
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:33,200
quit her at all

3487
00:58:33,680 --> 00:58:34,260
till late in

3488
00:58:34,260 --> 00:58:34,760
the evening,

3489
00:58:34,760 --> 00:58:35,660
when she had the comfort

3490
00:58:35,660 --> 00:58:36,860
of seeing her asleep

3491
00:58:36,920 --> 00:58:37,680
and when it seemed

3492
00:58:37,680 --> 00:58:38,600
to her rather right

3493
00:58:38,600 --> 00:58:39,300
and pleasant

3494
00:58:39,300 --> 00:58:39,840
that she should go

3495
00:58:39,840 --> 00:58:41,040
downstairs herself.

3496
00:58:42,360 --> 00:58:43,020
On entering

3497
00:58:43,020 --> 00:58:43,620
the drawing room,

3498
00:58:43,620 --> 00:58:44,000
she found

3499
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:45,200
the whole party a clue

3500
00:58:45,840 --> 00:58:46,620
and was immediately

3501
00:58:46,620 --> 00:58:47,820
invited to join them,

3502
00:58:47,940 --> 00:58:48,900
but suspecting them

3503
00:58:48,900 --> 00:58:50,100
to be playing high,

3504
00:58:50,120 --> 00:58:51,240
she declined. It

3505
00:58:51,240 --> 00:58:51,840
and making her

3506
00:58:51,840 --> 00:58:52,280
sister, the.

3507
00:58:52,280 --> 00:58:53,480
Excuse, said

3508
00:58:53,480 --> 00:58:54,120
she would amuse.

3509
00:58:54,120 --> 00:58:54,720
Herself

3510
00:58:54,720 --> 00:58:55,620
for the short time.

3511
00:58:55,620 --> 00:58:56,120
She could stay

3512
00:58:56,120 --> 00:58:57,320
below with a book.

3513
00:58:59,000 --> 00:58:59,400
Mr.

3514
00:58:59,400 --> 00:59:00,320
Hurst looked at her

3515
00:59:00,320 --> 00:59:01,520
with astonishment.

3516
00:59:01,980 --> 00:59:02,520
Do you prefer

3517
00:59:02,520 --> 00:59:03,680
reading to cards?

3518
00:59:03,680 --> 00:59:04,460
Said he.

3519
00:59:04,460 --> 00:59:05,660
That is rather singular.

3520
00:59:05,840 --> 00:59:07,560
Miss Eliza Bennet said

3521
00:59:07,560 --> 00:59:08,100
Miss Bingley

3522
00:59:08,100 --> 00:59:09,740
despises cards.

3523
00:59:10,020 --> 00:59:11,180
She is a great reader

3524
00:59:11,180 --> 00:59:12,120
and has no pleasure

3525
00:59:12,120 --> 00:59:13,320
in anything else.

3526
00:59:13,680 --> 00:59:14,600
I deserve neither

3527
00:59:14,600 --> 00:59:15,320
such praise

3528
00:59:15,320 --> 00:59:16,520
nor such censure.

3529
00:59:16,920 --> 00:59:18,120
Cried Elizabeth.

3530
00:59:18,240 --> 00:59:19,580
I am not a great reader

3531
00:59:19,800 --> 00:59:20,600
and I have pleasure

3532
00:59:20,600 --> 00:59:21,800
in many things.

3533
00:59:21,920 --> 00:59:22,880
In nursing your sister,

3534
00:59:22,880 --> 00:59:23,520
I am sure you have

3535
00:59:23,520 --> 00:59:24,360
pleasure.

3536
00:59:24,360 --> 00:59:25,460
Said Bingley.

3537
00:59:25,460 --> 00:59:25,860
And I hope

3538
00:59:25,860 --> 00:59:26,280
it will soon

3539
00:59:26,280 --> 00:59:26,840
be increased

3540
00:59:26,840 --> 00:59:27,380
by seeing her

3541
00:59:27,380 --> 00:59:28,580
quite well.

3542
00:59:30,300 --> 00:59:30,860
Elizabeth

3543
00:59:30,860 --> 00:59:31,340
thanked him

3544
00:59:31,340 --> 00:59:32,280
from her heart

3545
00:59:32,280 --> 00:59:33,440
and then walked towards

3546
00:59:33,440 --> 00:59:33,900
the table

3547
00:59:33,900 --> 00:59:34,100
where a

3548
00:59:34,100 --> 00:59:35,300
few books were lying.

3549
00:59:35,540 --> 00:59:36,420
He immediately offered

3550
00:59:36,420 --> 00:59:37,620
to fetch the others,

3551
00:59:38,040 --> 00:59:38,600
all that his

3552
00:59:38,600 --> 00:59:39,800
library afforded.

3553
00:59:40,200 --> 00:59:41,340
And I wish my collection

3554
00:59:41,340 --> 00:59:41,900
were larger

3555
00:59:41,900 --> 00:59:42,660
for your benefit

3556
00:59:42,660 --> 00:59:43,740
and my own credit.

3557
00:59:43,740 --> 00:59:45,120
But I am an idle fellow,

3558
00:59:45,300 --> 00:59:45,620
and though

3559
00:59:45,620 --> 00:59:46,020
I have not

3560
00:59:46,020 --> 00:59:46,500
many,

3561
00:59:46,500 --> 00:59:47,160
I have more

3562
00:59:47,160 --> 00:59:48,360
than I ever looked into.

3563
00:59:48,720 --> 00:59:49,880
Elizabeth assured him

3564
00:59:49,880 --> 00:59:50,300
that she could

3565
00:59:50,300 --> 00:59:50,880
suit herself

3566
00:59:50,880 --> 00:59:51,540
perfectly with

3567
00:59:51,540 --> 00:59:52,340
those in the room.

3568
00:59:53,420 --> 00:59:54,840
I am astonished,

3569
00:59:55,340 --> 00:59:56,340
said Miss Bingley,

3570
00:59:56,340 --> 00:59:57,140
that my father

3571
00:59:57,140 --> 00:59:57,660
should have left

3572
00:59:57,660 --> 00:59:58,260
so small.

3573
00:59:58,260 --> 00:59:59,460
A collection of books.

3574
00:59:59,960 --> 01:00:00,260
What a

3575
01:00:00,260 --> 01:00:01,460
delightful library

3576
01:00:01,460 --> 01:00:01,920
you have at

3577
01:00:01,920 --> 01:00:02,820
Pemberley, Mr.

3578
01:00:02,820 --> 01:00:04,020
Darcy.

3579
01:00:04,100 --> 01:00:05,180
It ought to be good,

3580
01:00:05,180 --> 01:00:06,020
he replied.

3581
01:00:06,020 --> 01:00:06,860
It has been the work

3582
01:00:06,860 --> 01:00:08,060
of many generations.

3583
01:00:08,360 --> 01:00:09,380
And then you have added

3584
01:00:09,380 --> 01:00:10,940
so much to it yourself.

3585
01:00:11,340 --> 01:00:11,940
You are always

3586
01:00:11,940 --> 01:00:13,140
buying books.

3587
01:00:13,340 --> 01:00:14,220
I cannot comprehend

3588
01:00:14,220 --> 01:00:14,640
the neglect

3589
01:00:14,640 --> 01:00:15,500
of a family library

3590
01:00:15,500 --> 01:00:16,700
in such days as these

3591
01:00:18,260 --> 01:00:19,380
neglect.

3592
01:00:19,380 --> 01:00:20,520
I I'm sure you neglect

3593
01:00:20,520 --> 01:00:21,480
nothing that can add

3594
01:00:21,480 --> 01:00:22,220
to the beauties

3595
01:00:22,220 --> 01:00:23,420
of that noble place.

3596
01:00:24,140 --> 01:00:24,960
Charles, when you

3597
01:00:24,960 --> 01:00:26,160
build your house,

3598
01:00:26,280 --> 01:00:27,260
I wish it may be half

3599
01:00:27,260 --> 01:00:27,900
as delightful

3600
01:00:27,900 --> 01:00:29,100
as Pemberley.

3601
01:00:29,540 --> 01:00:30,720
I wish it may.

3602
01:00:30,720 --> 01:00:31,500
But I would really

3603
01:00:31,500 --> 01:00:31,980
advise you

3604
01:00:31,980 --> 01:00:33,080
to make your purchase

3605
01:00:33,080 --> 01:00:34,200
in that neighborhood

3606
01:00:34,200 --> 01:00:35,120
and take Pemberley

3607
01:00:35,120 --> 01:00:36,300
for a kind of model.

3608
01:00:36,300 --> 01:00:36,680
There's not a

3609
01:00:36,680 --> 01:00:37,920
finer county in England

3610
01:00:37,920 --> 01:00:38,660
than Derbyshire.

3611
01:00:39,840 --> 01:00:40,400
With all my

3612
01:00:40,400 --> 01:00:41,100
heart, I will

3613
01:00:41,100 --> 01:00:42,320
buy Pemberley itself

3614
01:00:42,320 --> 01:00:43,520
if Darcy will sell it.

3615
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:44,840
I am talking

3616
01:00:44,840 --> 01:00:45,780
of possibilities,

3617
01:00:45,780 --> 01:00:46,800
Charles.

3618
01:00:46,800 --> 01:00:48,060
Upon my word, Caroline.

3619
01:00:48,060 --> 01:00:48,480
I should think

3620
01:00:48,480 --> 01:00:49,100
it more possible

3621
01:00:49,100 --> 01:00:49,800
to get Pemberley

3622
01:00:49,800 --> 01:00:50,460
by purchase

3623
01:00:50,460 --> 01:00:51,660
than by imitation.

3624
01:00:53,300 --> 01:00:54,060
Elizabeth was

3625
01:00:54,060 --> 01:00:54,740
so much caught

3626
01:00:54,740 --> 01:00:55,800
with what passed

3627
01:00:55,800 --> 01:00:56,340
as to leave

3628
01:00:56,340 --> 01:00:56,720
for very

3629
01:00:56,720 --> 01:00:57,420
little attention

3630
01:00:57,420 --> 01:00:58,340
for her book.

3631
01:00:58,340 --> 01:00:58,620
And.

3632
01:00:58,620 --> 01:00:59,340
Soon laying it

3633
01:00:59,340 --> 01:01:00,420
wholly aside.

3634
01:01:00,420 --> 01:01:00,860
She drew

3635
01:01:00,860 --> 01:01:02,060
near the car table

3636
01:01:02,100 --> 01:01:03,180
and stationed herself

3637
01:01:03,180 --> 01:01:03,740
between Mr.

3638
01:01:03,740 --> 01:01:04,140
Bingley

3639
01:01:04,140 --> 01:01:05,340
and his eldest sister

3640
01:01:05,420 --> 01:01:06,620
to observe the game.

3641
01:01:07,740 --> 01:01:08,120
Is Ms..

3642
01:01:08,120 --> 01:01:09,060
Darcy much grown

3643
01:01:09,060 --> 01:01:10,260
since the spring?

3644
01:01:10,260 --> 01:01:10,640
Said Ms.

3645
01:01:10,640 --> 01:01:11,840
Bingley.

3646
01:01:12,120 --> 01:01:12,840
Will she be

3647
01:01:12,840 --> 01:01:14,040
as tall as I am?

3648
01:01:14,900 --> 01:01:16,100
I think she will.

3649
01:01:16,100 --> 01:01:17,180
She is now about Miss

3650
01:01:17,180 --> 01:01:17,660
Elizabeth

3651
01:01:17,660 --> 01:01:18,320
Bennet's height,

3652
01:01:18,320 --> 01:01:19,520
or rather taller.

3653
01:01:20,460 --> 01:01:21,720
How I longed

3654
01:01:21,720 --> 01:01:22,920
to see her again.

3655
01:01:23,120 --> 01:01:24,380
I never met with anybody

3656
01:01:24,380 --> 01:01:25,040
who delighted me

3657
01:01:25,040 --> 01:01:25,940
as much.

3658
01:01:25,940 --> 01:01:27,240
Such a countenance,

3659
01:01:27,240 --> 01:01:28,460
such manners,

3660
01:01:28,820 --> 01:01:29,180
and so

3661
01:01:29,180 --> 01:01:30,740
extremely accomplished

3662
01:01:30,740 --> 01:01:31,740
for her age.

3663
01:01:31,740 --> 01:01:32,660
Her performance on

3664
01:01:32,660 --> 01:01:33,860
the pianoforte is

3665
01:01:33,860 --> 01:01:35,100
exquisite.

3666
01:01:36,360 --> 01:01:37,560
It is amazing to me,

3667
01:01:37,680 --> 01:01:38,780
said Bingley.

3668
01:01:38,780 --> 01:01:39,660
How young ladies

3669
01:01:39,660 --> 01:01:40,320
can have patience

3670
01:01:40,320 --> 01:01:40,520
to be

3671
01:01:40,520 --> 01:01:41,580
so very accomplished

3672
01:01:41,580 --> 01:01:42,780
as they all are.

3673
01:01:43,380 --> 01:01:44,040
All young

3674
01:01:44,040 --> 01:01:45,320
ladies accomplished.

3675
01:01:45,660 --> 01:01:46,760
My dear Charles,

3676
01:01:46,760 --> 01:01:47,960
what do you mean?

3677
01:01:48,960 --> 01:01:50,040
Yes, all of them,

3678
01:01:50,040 --> 01:01:51,080
I think.

3679
01:01:51,080 --> 01:01:51,660
They all paint

3680
01:01:51,660 --> 01:01:52,880
tables, cover screens

3681
01:01:52,880 --> 01:01:54,080
and net purses.

3682
01:01:55,320 --> 01:01:56,040
I scarcely know

3683
01:01:56,040 --> 01:01:56,900
anyone who cannot do

3684
01:01:56,900 --> 01:01:58,100
all this.

3685
01:01:58,280 --> 01:01:59,000
And I am sure

3686
01:01:59,000 --> 01:01:59,520
I never heard

3687
01:01:59,520 --> 01:02:00,120
a young lady

3688
01:02:00,120 --> 01:02:00,600
spoken of

3689
01:02:00,600 --> 01:02:01,560
for the first time

3690
01:02:01,560 --> 01:02:02,480
without being informed

3691
01:02:02,480 --> 01:02:02,900
that she was

3692
01:02:02,900 --> 01:02:04,100
very accomplished.

3693
01:02:04,580 --> 01:02:05,660
Your list of the common

3694
01:02:05,660 --> 01:02:06,120
extent of

3695
01:02:06,120 --> 01:02:07,320
accomplishments

3696
01:02:07,320 --> 01:02:08,340
said Darcy,

3697
01:02:08,340 --> 01:02:09,600
has too much truth.

3698
01:02:10,200 --> 01:02:11,060
The word is applied

3699
01:02:11,060 --> 01:02:11,420
to many

3700
01:02:11,420 --> 01:02:12,420
a woman who deserves it

3701
01:02:12,420 --> 01:02:13,400
no otherwise

3702
01:02:13,400 --> 01:02:14,720
than by netting a purse

3703
01:02:14,760 --> 01:02:15,960
or covering a screen.

3704
01:02:17,100 --> 01:02:18,020
But I am very far

3705
01:02:18,020 --> 01:02:19,200
from agreeing with you

3706
01:02:19,200 --> 01:02:20,160
in your estimation

3707
01:02:20,160 --> 01:02:21,360
of ladies in general.

3708
01:02:22,040 --> 01:02:22,940
I cannot boast of

3709
01:02:22,940 --> 01:02:23,360
knowing more

3710
01:02:23,360 --> 01:02:24,180
than half a dozen

3711
01:02:24,180 --> 01:02:24,920
in the whole range

3712
01:02:24,920 --> 01:02:25,800
of my acquaintance that

3713
01:02:25,800 --> 01:02:26,760
are really accomplished.

3714
01:02:28,320 --> 01:02:29,240
Nor I,

3715
01:02:29,240 --> 01:02:30,440
I am sure.

3716
01:02:30,680 --> 01:02:31,200
Said Ms..

3717
01:02:31,200 --> 01:02:32,400
Bingley,

3718
01:02:32,400 --> 01:02:34,320
then observed Elizabeth.

3719
01:02:34,820 --> 01:02:35,900
You must comprehend

3720
01:02:35,900 --> 01:02:37,080
great deal in your idea

3721
01:02:37,080 --> 01:02:37,220
of an

3722
01:02:37,220 --> 01:02:38,420
accomplished woman.

3723
01:02:38,960 --> 01:02:40,580
Yes, I do comprehend

3724
01:02:40,580 --> 01:02:41,780
a great deal in it.

3725
01:02:42,120 --> 01:02:42,620
Though.

3726
01:02:42,620 --> 01:02:43,820
Certainly.

3727
01:02:44,180 --> 01:02:44,580
Cried

3728
01:02:44,580 --> 01:02:45,780
his faithful assistant.

3729
01:02:46,200 --> 01:02:47,540
No one can really be

3730
01:02:47,540 --> 01:02:48,440
esteemed, accomplished,

3731
01:02:48,440 --> 01:02:48,660
who does

3732
01:02:48,660 --> 01:02:49,860
not greatly surpass,

3733
01:02:49,860 --> 01:02:50,820
which is usually met

3734
01:02:50,820 --> 01:02:52,160
with a woman,

3735
01:02:52,160 --> 01:02:53,200
must have a thorough

3736
01:02:53,200 --> 01:02:54,420
knowledge of music.

3737
01:02:54,560 --> 01:02:55,880
Singing, drawing,

3738
01:02:55,880 --> 01:02:56,480
dancing

3739
01:02:56,480 --> 01:02:57,680
in the modern languages

3740
01:02:57,720 --> 01:02:58,920
to deserve the word.

3741
01:02:59,280 --> 01:03:00,780
And besides all this,

3742
01:03:00,980 --> 01:03:02,120
she must possess

3743
01:03:02,120 --> 01:03:02,900
a certain

3744
01:03:02,900 --> 01:03:04,380
something in her air

3745
01:03:04,620 --> 01:03:06,000
and manner of walking.

3746
01:03:06,240 --> 01:03:07,700
The tone of her voice,

3747
01:03:07,880 --> 01:03:08,700
her dress

3748
01:03:08,700 --> 01:03:09,900
and expressions

3749
01:03:10,020 --> 01:03:11,040
or the word will be

3750
01:03:11,040 --> 01:03:12,540
but half deserved.

3751
01:03:14,120 --> 01:03:14,600
All this

3752
01:03:14,600 --> 01:03:15,780
she must possess.

3753
01:03:15,780 --> 01:03:16,980
Added Darcy.

3754
01:03:17,540 --> 01:03:18,140
And to all

3755
01:03:18,140 --> 01:03:18,720
she must yet

3756
01:03:18,720 --> 01:03:19,280
add something

3757
01:03:19,280 --> 01:03:20,160
more substantial

3758
01:03:20,160 --> 01:03:20,940
in the improvement

3759
01:03:20,940 --> 01:03:21,140
of her

3760
01:03:21,140 --> 01:03:21,560
mind by

3761
01:03:21,560 --> 01:03:22,500
extensive reading.

3762
01:03:23,760 --> 01:03:24,240
I am no.

3763
01:03:24,240 --> 01:03:25,280
Longer surprised at.

3764
01:03:25,280 --> 01:03:26,640
Your knowing only six

3765
01:03:26,640 --> 01:03:27,840
accomplished women.

3766
01:03:27,840 --> 01:03:28,880
I rather wonder now

3767
01:03:28,880 --> 01:03:30,080
at your knowing any.

3768
01:03:31,320 --> 01:03:32,480
Are you so severe upon

3769
01:03:32,480 --> 01:03:33,680
your own sex as to doubt

3770
01:03:33,680 --> 01:03:34,500
the possibility

3771
01:03:34,500 --> 01:03:35,700
of all this?

3772
01:03:36,080 --> 01:03:36,740
I never saw

3773
01:03:36,740 --> 01:03:37,700
such a woman.

3774
01:03:37,700 --> 01:03:38,360
I never saw

3775
01:03:38,360 --> 01:03:40,160
such capacity and taste.

3776
01:03:40,160 --> 01:03:40,920
And application

3777
01:03:40,920 --> 01:03:41,660
and elegance as.

3778
01:03:41,660 --> 01:03:42,860
You describe United.

3779
01:03:43,800 --> 01:03:44,180
Mrs.

3780
01:03:44,180 --> 01:03:45,240
Hurst and Miss Bingley

3781
01:03:45,240 --> 01:03:46,100
both cried out

3782
01:03:46,100 --> 01:03:47,060
against the injustice

3783
01:03:47,060 --> 01:03:48,260
of her implied doubt

3784
01:03:48,480 --> 01:03:49,580
and were both protesting

3785
01:03:49,580 --> 01:03:50,000
that they knew

3786
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:50,580
many women

3787
01:03:50,580 --> 01:03:51,020
who answered

3788
01:03:51,020 --> 01:03:51,960
this description.

3789
01:03:51,960 --> 01:03:52,560
When Mr.

3790
01:03:52,560 --> 01:03:53,420
Hurst called them

3791
01:03:53,420 --> 01:03:54,680
to order with bitter

3792
01:03:54,680 --> 01:03:55,220
complaints

3793
01:03:55,220 --> 01:03:56,100
of their inattention

3794
01:03:56,100 --> 01:03:56,540
to what was

3795
01:03:56,540 --> 01:03:57,740
going forward,

3796
01:03:57,840 --> 01:03:58,980
as all conversation

3797
01:03:58,980 --> 01:04:00,180
was thereby at an end,

3798
01:04:00,380 --> 01:04:00,920
Elizabeth

3799
01:04:00,920 --> 01:04:01,800
soon afterwards

3800
01:04:01,800 --> 01:04:03,000
left the room.

3801
01:04:03,480 --> 01:04:04,920
Elizabeth Bennett

3802
01:04:05,340 --> 01:04:06,240
said Miss Bingley,

3803
01:04:06,240 --> 01:04:07,220
when the door was closed

3804
01:04:07,220 --> 01:04:08,180
on her.

3805
01:04:08,180 --> 01:04:08,840
Is one of those

3806
01:04:08,840 --> 01:04:09,540
young ladies

3807
01:04:09,540 --> 01:04:10,440
who seek to recommend.

3808
01:04:10,440 --> 01:04:10,880
Themselves

3809
01:04:10,880 --> 01:04:11,760
to the other sex

3810
01:04:11,760 --> 01:04:12,800
by undervaluing.

3811
01:04:12,800 --> 01:04:14,120
Their own herd.

3812
01:04:14,120 --> 01:04:14,820
With many men,

3813
01:04:14,820 --> 01:04:16,320
I dare say it succeeds.

3814
01:04:16,920 --> 01:04:18,120
But in my opinion,

3815
01:04:18,200 --> 01:04:19,560
it is a paltry device.

3816
01:04:19,920 --> 01:04:21,240
A very mean art.

3817
01:04:22,680 --> 01:04:23,960
Undoubtedly, replied.

3818
01:04:23,960 --> 01:04:25,100
Darcy, to whom

3819
01:04:25,100 --> 01:04:25,620
this remark

3820
01:04:25,620 --> 01:04:26,820
was chiefly addressed.

3821
01:04:27,060 --> 01:04:28,260
There is a meanness

3822
01:04:28,260 --> 01:04:29,340
in all the arts

3823
01:04:29,340 --> 01:04:29,900
which ladies

3824
01:04:29,900 --> 01:04:31,200
sometimes condescend

3825
01:04:31,320 --> 01:04:32,400
to employ

3826
01:04:32,400 --> 01:04:33,600
for captivation.

3827
01:04:34,200 --> 01:04:35,520
Whatever Barnes affinity

3828
01:04:35,520 --> 01:04:36,420
to cunning

3829
01:04:36,420 --> 01:04:37,620
is despicable.

3830
01:04:38,480 --> 01:04:38,760
Ms..

3831
01:04:38,760 --> 01:04:39,540
Bingley was not

3832
01:04:39,540 --> 01:04:40,880
so entirely satisfied

3833
01:04:40,880 --> 01:04:41,600
with this reply

3834
01:04:41,600 --> 01:04:42,300
as to continue

3835
01:04:42,300 --> 01:04:43,500
the subject.

3836
01:04:43,880 --> 01:04:44,400
Elizabeth

3837
01:04:44,400 --> 01:04:45,260
joined them again,

3838
01:04:45,260 --> 01:04:45,960
only to say that

3839
01:04:45,960 --> 01:04:47,160
her sister was worse

3840
01:04:47,160 --> 01:04:47,760
and that she could

3841
01:04:47,760 --> 01:04:48,960
not leave her

3842
01:04:48,980 --> 01:04:50,100
being the urged Mr.

3843
01:04:50,100 --> 01:04:50,460
Jones

3844
01:04:50,460 --> 01:04:50,960
being sent

3845
01:04:50,960 --> 01:04:52,080
for immediately

3846
01:04:52,080 --> 01:04:52,260
while

3847
01:04:52,260 --> 01:04:53,360
his sister is convinced

3848
01:04:53,360 --> 01:04:54,480
that no country advice

3849
01:04:54,480 --> 01:04:55,680
could be of any service

3850
01:04:55,760 --> 01:04:56,400
recommended

3851
01:04:56,400 --> 01:04:57,600
and expressed to town

3852
01:04:57,600 --> 01:04:57,860
for one

3853
01:04:57,860 --> 01:04:58,260
of the most

3854
01:04:58,260 --> 01:04:59,460
eminent physicians.

3855
01:04:59,820 --> 01:05:00,140
This

3856
01:05:00,140 --> 01:05:01,320
she would not hear of.

3857
01:05:01,320 --> 01:05:01,980
But she was not

3858
01:05:01,980 --> 01:05:02,540
so unwilling

3859
01:05:02,540 --> 01:05:03,000
to comply

3860
01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:03,260
with her

3861
01:05:03,260 --> 01:05:04,460
brother's proposal,

3862
01:05:04,520 --> 01:05:05,240
and it was settled

3863
01:05:05,240 --> 01:05:05,580
that Mr.

3864
01:05:05,580 --> 01:05:06,420
Jones should be sent

3865
01:05:06,420 --> 01:05:06,980
for early

3866
01:05:06,980 --> 01:05:07,740
in the morning.

3867
01:05:07,740 --> 01:05:08,720
If Miss Bennett were not

3868
01:05:08,720 --> 01:05:09,920
decidedly better.

3869
01:05:10,320 --> 01:05:10,760
Bingley

3870
01:05:10,760 --> 01:05:12,120
was quite uncomfortable.

3871
01:05:12,380 --> 01:05:13,380
His sisters declared

3872
01:05:13,380 --> 01:05:13,740
that they were

3873
01:05:13,740 --> 01:05:14,880
miserable.

3874
01:05:14,880 --> 01:05:15,600
They saw this

3875
01:05:15,600 --> 01:05:16,380
to their wretchedness,

3876
01:05:16,380 --> 01:05:17,480
however, by duets

3877
01:05:17,480 --> 01:05:18,420
after supper,

3878
01:05:18,420 --> 01:05:19,220
while he could find

3879
01:05:19,220 --> 01:05:19,940
no better relief

3880
01:05:19,940 --> 01:05:21,000
to his feelings

3881
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:21,600
than by giving

3882
01:05:21,600 --> 01:05:22,280
his housekeeper

3883
01:05:22,280 --> 01:05:22,800
directions

3884
01:05:22,800 --> 01:05:23,760
that every attention

3885
01:05:23,760 --> 01:05:24,360
might be paid

3886
01:05:24,360 --> 01:05:25,400
to the sick lady

3887
01:05:25,400 --> 01:05:26,240
and her sister.

3888
01:05:28,760 --> 01:05:29,960
Chapter nine.

3889
01:05:31,280 --> 01:05:31,820
Elizabeth

3890
01:05:31,820 --> 01:05:32,640
passed the chief

3891
01:05:32,640 --> 01:05:33,120
of the night

3892
01:05:33,120 --> 01:05:34,320
in her sister's room

3893
01:05:34,440 --> 01:05:35,280
and in the morning

3894
01:05:35,280 --> 01:05:35,840
had the pleasure

3895
01:05:35,840 --> 01:05:36,380
of being able

3896
01:05:36,380 --> 01:05:36,740
to send

3897
01:05:36,740 --> 01:05:37,740
a tolerable answer

3898
01:05:37,740 --> 01:05:38,520
to the inquiries

3899
01:05:38,520 --> 01:05:39,080
which she very

3900
01:05:39,080 --> 01:05:40,280
early received from Mr.

3901
01:05:40,280 --> 01:05:41,480
Bingley by a housemaid,

3902
01:05:41,880 --> 01:05:43,040
and sometime afterwards

3903
01:05:43,040 --> 01:05:43,260
from the

3904
01:05:43,260 --> 01:05:44,280
two elegant ladies

3905
01:05:44,280 --> 01:05:44,700
who waited

3906
01:05:44,700 --> 01:05:45,900
on his sisters.

3907
01:05:45,960 --> 01:05:46,440
In spite

3908
01:05:46,440 --> 01:05:47,180
of this amendment,

3909
01:05:47,180 --> 01:05:48,540
however, she requested

3910
01:05:48,540 --> 01:05:49,140
to have a note

3911
01:05:49,140 --> 01:05:50,300
sent along borne

3912
01:05:50,300 --> 01:05:51,000
desiring her

3913
01:05:51,000 --> 01:05:52,200
mother to visit Jane

3914
01:05:52,280 --> 01:05:52,820
and form her

3915
01:05:52,820 --> 01:05:53,460
own judgment

3916
01:05:53,460 --> 01:05:54,660
of her situation.

3917
01:05:54,840 --> 01:05:55,880
The note was immediately

3918
01:05:55,880 --> 01:05:56,760
dispatched

3919
01:05:56,760 --> 01:05:57,660
and its contents.

3920
01:05:57,660 --> 01:05:58,280
As quickly

3921
01:05:58,280 --> 01:05:59,400
complied with.

3922
01:05:59,400 --> 01:05:59,760
Mrs.

3923
01:05:59,760 --> 01:06:00,660
Bennett, accompanied

3924
01:06:00,660 --> 01:06:01,080
by her two

3925
01:06:01,080 --> 01:06:02,180
youngest girls,

3926
01:06:02,180 --> 01:06:03,140
reached Netherfield

3927
01:06:03,140 --> 01:06:04,280
soon after the family

3928
01:06:04,280 --> 01:06:05,480
breakfast.

3929
01:06:05,580 --> 01:06:06,800
Had she found Jane in

3930
01:06:06,800 --> 01:06:07,500
any apparent

3931
01:06:07,500 --> 01:06:08,540
danger, Mrs.

3932
01:06:08,540 --> 01:06:08,840
Bennett

3933
01:06:08,840 --> 01:06:09,260
would have been

3934
01:06:09,260 --> 01:06:10,460
very miserable.

3935
01:06:10,520 --> 01:06:11,720
But being satisfied on

3936
01:06:11,720 --> 01:06:12,200
seeing her

3937
01:06:12,200 --> 01:06:12,780
that her illness

3938
01:06:12,780 --> 01:06:13,860
was not alarming.

3939
01:06:13,860 --> 01:06:14,880
She had no wish of her

3940
01:06:14,880 --> 01:06:16,080
recovering immediately

3941
01:06:16,220 --> 01:06:17,220
as her restoration

3942
01:06:17,220 --> 01:06:17,580
to health

3943
01:06:17,580 --> 01:06:18,060
would probably

3944
01:06:18,060 --> 01:06:18,600
remove her

3945
01:06:18,600 --> 01:06:19,560
from Netherfield.

3946
01:06:19,560 --> 01:06:20,160
She would not

3947
01:06:20,160 --> 01:06:21,140
listen, therefore,

3948
01:06:21,140 --> 01:06:21,860
to her daughter's

3949
01:06:21,860 --> 01:06:22,560
proposal of

3950
01:06:22,560 --> 01:06:23,760
being carried home.

3951
01:06:23,960 --> 01:06:24,540
Neither did

3952
01:06:24,540 --> 01:06:25,400
the apothecary,

3953
01:06:25,400 --> 01:06:25,940
who arrived

3954
01:06:25,940 --> 01:06:27,120
about the same time

3955
01:06:27,120 --> 01:06:27,600
think it at

3956
01:06:27,600 --> 01:06:28,800
all advisable.

3957
01:06:29,060 --> 01:06:29,760
After sitting a

3958
01:06:29,760 --> 01:06:30,200
little while

3959
01:06:30,200 --> 01:06:30,740
with Jane

3960
01:06:30,740 --> 01:06:31,520
on Miss Bingley

3961
01:06:31,520 --> 01:06:32,040
appearance

3962
01:06:32,040 --> 01:06:33,060
and invitation.

3963
01:06:33,060 --> 01:06:33,500
The mother

3964
01:06:33,500 --> 01:06:34,320
and three daughters

3965
01:06:34,320 --> 01:06:35,000
all attended her

3966
01:06:35,000 --> 01:06:35,280
into the

3967
01:06:35,280 --> 01:06:36,480
breakfast parlor.

3968
01:06:36,620 --> 01:06:37,500
Bingley met them

3969
01:06:37,500 --> 01:06:38,400
with hopes that Mrs.

3970
01:06:38,400 --> 01:06:38,760
Bennett had

3971
01:06:38,760 --> 01:06:39,440
not found Ms..

3972
01:06:39,440 --> 01:06:40,140
Bennett worse

3973
01:06:40,140 --> 01:06:41,340
than she expected.

3974
01:06:41,940 --> 01:06:42,440
Indeed

3975
01:06:42,440 --> 01:06:43,640
I have, sir.

3976
01:06:43,760 --> 01:06:44,940
Was her answer.

3977
01:06:44,940 --> 01:06:46,100
She is a great deal too

3978
01:06:46,100 --> 01:06:47,300
ill to be moved.

3979
01:06:47,300 --> 01:06:47,660
Mr.

3980
01:06:47,660 --> 01:06:48,840
Jones says we must not

3981
01:06:48,840 --> 01:06:50,040
think of moving her.

3982
01:06:50,240 --> 01:06:51,600
We must trespass

3983
01:06:51,600 --> 01:06:52,340
a little longer

3984
01:06:52,340 --> 01:06:53,540
on your kindness.

3985
01:06:54,060 --> 01:06:55,040
Removed.

3986
01:06:55,040 --> 01:06:56,120
Cried Bingley.

3987
01:06:56,120 --> 01:06:56,700
It must not

3988
01:06:56,700 --> 01:06:57,680
be thought of.

3989
01:06:57,680 --> 01:06:58,680
My sister, I am sure,

3990
01:06:58,680 --> 01:06:59,280
will not hear

3991
01:06:59,280 --> 01:07:00,480
of her removal.

3992
01:07:00,720 --> 01:07:01,760
You may depend

3993
01:07:01,760 --> 01:07:02,960
upon it, madam.

3994
01:07:03,060 --> 01:07:03,900
Said Miss Bingley,

3995
01:07:03,900 --> 01:07:05,100
with cold civility.

3996
01:07:05,540 --> 01:07:06,480
That Miss Bennett

3997
01:07:06,480 --> 01:07:06,980
will receive

3998
01:07:06,980 --> 01:07:08,460
every possible attention

3999
01:07:08,460 --> 01:07:08,880
while she

4000
01:07:08,880 --> 01:07:10,080
remains with us.

4001
01:07:10,520 --> 01:07:10,920
Mrs.

4002
01:07:10,920 --> 01:07:12,140
Bennett was profuse

4003
01:07:12,140 --> 01:07:13,340
in her acknowledgments.

4004
01:07:13,680 --> 01:07:15,960
I am sure, she added,

4005
01:07:16,260 --> 01:07:16,980
If it were not

4006
01:07:16,980 --> 01:07:18,200
for such good friends,

4007
01:07:18,200 --> 01:07:18,960
I do not know

4008
01:07:18,960 --> 01:07:19,400
what would

4009
01:07:19,400 --> 01:07:20,300
become of her.

4010
01:07:20,300 --> 01:07:21,000
For she is very

4011
01:07:21,000 --> 01:07:22,160
ill indeed and suffers

4012
01:07:22,160 --> 01:07:23,360
a vast deal.

4013
01:07:23,640 --> 01:07:24,240
The greatest

4014
01:07:24,240 --> 01:07:25,440
patients in the world,

4015
01:07:25,460 --> 01:07:26,600
which is always the way

4016
01:07:26,600 --> 01:07:27,300
with her,

4017
01:07:27,300 --> 01:07:28,160
for she has,

4018
01:07:28,160 --> 01:07:28,980
without exception,

4019
01:07:28,980 --> 01:07:30,260
the sweetest temper

4020
01:07:30,260 --> 01:07:31,460
I have ever met with.

4021
01:07:31,880 --> 01:07:32,660
I often tell

4022
01:07:32,660 --> 01:07:33,320
my other girls

4023
01:07:33,320 --> 01:07:33,660
that they are

4024
01:07:33,660 --> 01:07:34,860
nothing to her.

4025
01:07:35,340 --> 01:07:36,420
You have a sweet room

4026
01:07:36,420 --> 01:07:36,860
here, Mr.

4027
01:07:36,860 --> 01:07:37,380
Bingley,

4028
01:07:37,380 --> 01:07:38,720
and a charming prospect

4029
01:07:38,720 --> 01:07:39,920
over the gravel walk.

4030
01:07:40,020 --> 01:07:40,820
I do not know

4031
01:07:40,820 --> 01:07:41,640
a place in the country

4032
01:07:41,640 --> 01:07:42,240
that is equal

4033
01:07:42,240 --> 01:07:43,320
to Netherfield.

4034
01:07:43,320 --> 01:07:44,160
You will not think of

4035
01:07:44,160 --> 01:07:45,060
quitting it in a hurry.

4036
01:07:45,060 --> 01:07:45,920
I hope that you

4037
01:07:45,920 --> 01:07:47,120
have but a short lease.

4038
01:07:48,440 --> 01:07:49,020
Whatever I

4039
01:07:49,020 --> 01:07:50,220
do is done in a hurry,

4040
01:07:50,400 --> 01:07:51,560
replied he.

4041
01:07:51,560 --> 01:07:52,100
And therefore,

4042
01:07:52,100 --> 01:07:52,460
if I should

4043
01:07:52,460 --> 01:07:52,920
resolve to

4044
01:07:52,920 --> 01:07:53,720
quit Netherfield,

4045
01:07:53,720 --> 01:07:53,960
I should

4046
01:07:53,960 --> 01:07:54,620
probably be off

4047
01:07:54,620 --> 01:07:55,820
in 5 minutes.

4048
01:07:56,420 --> 01:07:56,940
At present,

4049
01:07:56,940 --> 01:07:57,300
however,

4050
01:07:57,300 --> 01:07:58,160
I consider myself

4051
01:07:58,160 --> 01:07:59,360
as quite fixed here.

4052
01:08:00,260 --> 01:08:01,200
That is exactly

4053
01:08:01,200 --> 01:08:01,640
what I should have

4054
01:08:01,640 --> 01:08:02,220
supposed of.

4055
01:08:02,220 --> 01:08:03,620
You said Elizabeth.

4056
01:08:04,200 --> 01:08:04,680
You begin to

4057
01:08:04,680 --> 01:08:05,820
comprehend me. Do you?

4058
01:08:05,820 --> 01:08:07,080
Cried he, turning

4059
01:08:07,080 --> 01:08:08,280
towards her.

4060
01:08:08,400 --> 01:08:09,380
Yes.

4061
01:08:09,380 --> 01:08:10,280
I understand

4062
01:08:10,280 --> 01:08:11,480
you perfectly.

4063
01:08:12,320 --> 01:08:13,160
I wish I might take

4064
01:08:13,160 --> 01:08:14,360
this for a compliment,

4065
01:08:14,480 --> 01:08:15,480
but to be so easily

4066
01:08:15,480 --> 01:08:16,140
seen through,

4067
01:08:16,140 --> 01:08:17,340
I am afraid, is pitiful.

4068
01:08:18,620 --> 01:08:20,040
That is, as it happens,

4069
01:08:20,300 --> 01:08:21,320
it does not follow that

4070
01:08:21,320 --> 01:08:22,260
a deep, intricate

4071
01:08:22,260 --> 01:08:23,240
character is more

4072
01:08:23,240 --> 01:08:23,600
or less.

4073
01:08:23,600 --> 01:08:24,600
Estimable than such a.

4074
01:08:24,600 --> 01:08:25,800
One as yours.

4075
01:08:25,940 --> 01:08:27,020
Lizzie

4076
01:08:27,020 --> 01:08:28,200
cried her mother.

4077
01:08:28,200 --> 01:08:29,460
Remember where you are

4078
01:08:29,520 --> 01:08:30,440
and do not run on

4079
01:08:30,440 --> 01:08:31,400
in the wild manner

4080
01:08:31,400 --> 01:08:32,100
that you are suffered

4081
01:08:32,100 --> 01:08:33,300
to do at home.

4082
01:08:33,600 --> 01:08:34,800
I did not know before.

4083
01:08:35,220 --> 01:08:36,120
Continued Bingley,

4084
01:08:36,120 --> 01:08:37,160
immediately.

4085
01:08:37,160 --> 01:08:37,940
That you were

4086
01:08:37,940 --> 01:08:39,180
a studier of character.

4087
01:08:39,440 --> 01:08:40,040
It must be an

4088
01:08:40,040 --> 01:08:41,240
amusing study.

4089
01:08:41,380 --> 01:08:42,300
Yes, but

4090
01:08:42,300 --> 01:08:43,400
intricate characters

4091
01:08:43,400 --> 01:08:44,600
are the most amusing.

4092
01:08:44,840 --> 01:08:45,960
They have at least

4093
01:08:45,960 --> 01:08:47,160
that advantage.

4094
01:08:48,020 --> 01:08:49,220
The country.

4095
01:08:49,260 --> 01:08:49,500
Said.

4096
01:08:49,500 --> 01:08:50,720
Darcy can, in

4097
01:08:50,720 --> 01:08:51,560
general supply

4098
01:08:51,560 --> 01:08:52,460
but few subjects

4099
01:08:52,460 --> 01:08:53,660
for such a study.

4100
01:08:53,880 --> 01:08:55,000
In a country

4101
01:08:55,000 --> 01:08:55,560
you move in

4102
01:08:55,560 --> 01:08:56,420
a very confined

4103
01:08:56,420 --> 01:08:57,680
and unvarying society.

4104
01:08:58,460 --> 01:08:59,760
But people themselves

4105
01:08:59,760 --> 01:09:00,840
alter so much

4106
01:09:00,840 --> 01:09:01,200
that there is

4107
01:09:01,200 --> 01:09:01,800
something new

4108
01:09:01,800 --> 01:09:02,380
to be observed

4109
01:09:02,380 --> 01:09:03,600
in them forever.

4110
01:09:03,980 --> 01:09:05,240
Yes, indeed.

4111
01:09:05,580 --> 01:09:06,260
Cried Mrs.

4112
01:09:06,260 --> 01:09:06,760
Bennett,

4113
01:09:06,760 --> 01:09:07,420
offended by

4114
01:09:07,420 --> 01:09:08,540
his manner of mentioning

4115
01:09:08,540 --> 01:09:09,740
a country neighborhood.

4116
01:09:10,020 --> 01:09:10,820
I assure you

4117
01:09:10,820 --> 01:09:11,480
there is quite

4118
01:09:11,480 --> 01:09:12,300
as much of that

4119
01:09:12,300 --> 01:09:13,200
going on in the country

4120
01:09:13,200 --> 01:09:14,400
as in town.

4121
01:09:14,960 --> 01:09:16,260
Everybody was surprised.

4122
01:09:16,520 --> 01:09:17,460
And Darcy, after

4123
01:09:17,460 --> 01:09:17,920
looking at her

4124
01:09:17,920 --> 01:09:18,740
for a moment.

4125
01:09:18,740 --> 01:09:19,140
Turned.

4126
01:09:19,140 --> 01:09:20,340
Silently away.

4127
01:09:20,600 --> 01:09:21,020
Mrs.

4128
01:09:21,020 --> 01:09:21,920
Bennett, who fancied

4129
01:09:21,920 --> 01:09:22,420
she had gained

4130
01:09:22,420 --> 01:09:23,380
a complete victory.

4131
01:09:23,380 --> 01:09:24,060
Over him,

4132
01:09:24,060 --> 01:09:25,340
continued her triumph.

4133
01:09:25,960 --> 01:09:26,880
I cannot see

4134
01:09:26,880 --> 01:09:27,660
that London has

4135
01:09:27,660 --> 01:09:28,680
any great advantage

4136
01:09:28,680 --> 01:09:29,540
over the country

4137
01:09:29,540 --> 01:09:30,500
for my part,

4138
01:09:30,500 --> 01:09:31,500
except the shops

4139
01:09:31,500 --> 01:09:32,700
and public places.

4140
01:09:32,900 --> 01:09:34,280
The country is a vast

4141
01:09:34,280 --> 01:09:35,340
deal pleasanter, is it

4142
01:09:35,340 --> 01:09:35,800
not, Mr.

4143
01:09:35,800 --> 01:09:36,740
Bingley.

4144
01:09:36,740 --> 01:09:37,260
When I am in

4145
01:09:37,260 --> 01:09:38,160
the country.

4146
01:09:38,160 --> 01:09:39,080
He replied.

4147
01:09:39,080 --> 01:09:39,660
I never wish

4148
01:09:39,660 --> 01:09:40,100
to leave it,

4149
01:09:40,100 --> 01:09:41,000
and when I am in town

4150
01:09:41,000 --> 01:09:41,520
it is pretty

4151
01:09:41,520 --> 01:09:42,720
much the same.

4152
01:09:42,840 --> 01:09:43,500
They have each

4153
01:09:43,500 --> 01:09:44,380
their advantages

4154
01:09:44,380 --> 01:09:45,020
and I can be

4155
01:09:45,020 --> 01:09:45,720
equally happy.

4156
01:09:45,720 --> 01:09:46,160
And either.

4157
01:09:47,340 --> 01:09:48,200
I.

4158
01:09:48,200 --> 01:09:49,380
That is because you

4159
01:09:49,380 --> 01:09:49,580
have the

4160
01:09:49,580 --> 01:09:50,780
right disposition.

4161
01:09:50,920 --> 01:09:52,420
But that gentleman.

4162
01:09:52,820 --> 01:09:54,020
Looking at Darcy.

4163
01:09:54,120 --> 01:09:54,860
Seemed to think

4164
01:09:54,860 --> 01:09:55,220
the country

4165
01:09:55,220 --> 01:09:56,420
was nothing at all.

4166
01:09:57,120 --> 01:09:58,020
Indeed, Mama,

4167
01:09:58,020 --> 01:09:59,220
you are mistaken.

4168
01:09:59,420 --> 01:10:00,120
Said Elizabeth,

4169
01:10:00,120 --> 01:10:01,320
blushing for her mother.

4170
01:10:01,640 --> 01:10:03,020
You quite mistook Mr..

4171
01:10:03,860 --> 01:10:04,700
He only meant that.

4172
01:10:04,700 --> 01:10:05,300
There was not such

4173
01:10:05,300 --> 01:10:06,340
a variety of people

4174
01:10:06,340 --> 01:10:06,760
to be met.

4175
01:10:06,760 --> 01:10:07,520
Within the country

4176
01:10:07,520 --> 01:10:08,600
as in town.

4177
01:10:08,600 --> 01:10:08,800
Which

4178
01:10:08,800 --> 01:10:09,620
he must acknowledge

4179
01:10:09,620 --> 01:10:10,820
to be true.

4180
01:10:11,100 --> 01:10:12,300
Certainly, my dear,

4181
01:10:12,300 --> 01:10:13,620
nobody there were.

4182
01:10:13,880 --> 01:10:15,020
But as to not meeting

4183
01:10:15,020 --> 01:10:15,680
with many people

4184
01:10:15,680 --> 01:10:16,700
in this neighborhood,

4185
01:10:16,700 --> 01:10:17,640
I believe there are few

4186
01:10:17,640 --> 01:10:18,840
neighborhoods larger.

4187
01:10:19,040 --> 01:10:20,220
I know we dined

4188
01:10:20,220 --> 01:10:20,800
with four

4189
01:10:20,800 --> 01:10:22,300
and 20 families.

4190
01:10:23,180 --> 01:10:23,920
Nothing but

4191
01:10:23,920 --> 01:10:25,140
concern for Elizabeth

4192
01:10:25,140 --> 01:10:26,100
could enable Bingley

4193
01:10:26,100 --> 01:10:27,300
to keep his countenance.

4194
01:10:27,600 --> 01:10:28,200
His sister

4195
01:10:28,200 --> 01:10:29,360
was less delicate

4196
01:10:29,360 --> 01:10:30,460
and directed her eyes

4197
01:10:30,460 --> 01:10:31,140
towards Mr.

4198
01:10:31,140 --> 01:10:31,560
Darcy

4199
01:10:31,560 --> 01:10:32,720
with a very expressive

4200
01:10:32,720 --> 01:10:33,800
smile.

4201
01:10:33,800 --> 01:10:34,880
Elizabeth, for the sake

4202
01:10:34,880 --> 01:10:35,660
of saying something

4203
01:10:35,660 --> 01:10:36,340
that might turn her

4204
01:10:36,340 --> 01:10:37,400
mother's thoughts.

4205
01:10:37,400 --> 01:10:38,220
Now asked her

4206
01:10:38,220 --> 01:10:38,660
if Charlotte

4207
01:10:38,660 --> 01:10:39,340
Lucas had been

4208
01:10:39,340 --> 01:10:40,020
at Long Bourn

4209
01:10:40,020 --> 01:10:41,220
since her coming away.

4210
01:10:41,780 --> 01:10:42,540
Yes.

4211
01:10:42,540 --> 01:10:43,020
She called

4212
01:10:43,020 --> 01:10:43,620
yesterday with

4213
01:10:43,620 --> 01:10:44,600
the father

4214
01:10:44,600 --> 01:10:45,860
was an agreeable man.

4215
01:10:45,860 --> 01:10:46,820
So William is Mr.

4216
01:10:46,820 --> 01:10:47,540
Bingley, is he?

4217
01:10:47,540 --> 01:10:49,020
Not so much

4218
01:10:49,020 --> 01:10:50,120
the man of fashion,

4219
01:10:50,120 --> 01:10:52,100
so genteel and easy.

4220
01:10:52,400 --> 01:10:53,600
He had always something

4221
01:10:53,600 --> 01:10:54,800
to say to everybody.

4222
01:10:54,960 --> 01:10:56,840
That is my idea

4223
01:10:56,840 --> 01:10:58,040
of good breeding

4224
01:10:58,040 --> 01:10:59,060
and those persons

4225
01:10:59,060 --> 01:11:00,080
who fancy themselves

4226
01:11:00,080 --> 01:11:01,200
very important

4227
01:11:01,200 --> 01:11:01,700
and never

4228
01:11:01,700 --> 01:11:02,380
open their mouths.

4229
01:11:02,380 --> 01:11:03,500
Quite mistake

4230
01:11:03,500 --> 01:11:04,100
the matter.

4231
01:11:05,060 --> 01:11:05,880
Did Charlotte

4232
01:11:05,880 --> 01:11:07,080
dine with you?

4233
01:11:07,100 --> 01:11:07,880
No.

4234
01:11:07,880 --> 01:11:09,080
She would go home.

4235
01:11:09,200 --> 01:11:10,340
I fancy she was wanted

4236
01:11:10,340 --> 01:11:11,540
about the mince pies.

4237
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:12,880
For my part, Mr.

4238
01:11:12,880 --> 01:11:13,220
Bingley,

4239
01:11:13,220 --> 01:11:14,660
I always keep servants

4240
01:11:14,660 --> 01:11:15,000
that can do

4241
01:11:15,000 --> 01:11:15,800
their own work.

4242
01:11:15,800 --> 01:11:16,880
My daughters are

4243
01:11:16,880 --> 01:11:17,240
brought up

4244
01:11:17,240 --> 01:11:18,440
very differently.

4245
01:11:18,560 --> 01:11:19,260
But everybody

4246
01:11:19,260 --> 01:11:19,680
is to judge

4247
01:11:19,680 --> 01:11:20,380
for themselves.

4248
01:11:20,380 --> 01:11:21,060
And the Lucas

4249
01:11:21,060 --> 01:11:21,620
are very good

4250
01:11:21,620 --> 01:11:22,260
sort of girls,

4251
01:11:22,260 --> 01:11:23,260
I assure you.

4252
01:11:23,260 --> 01:11:24,060
It is a pity

4253
01:11:24,060 --> 01:11:25,260
they are not handsome.

4254
01:11:25,580 --> 01:11:26,240
Not that I think.

4255
01:11:26,240 --> 01:11:27,680
Charlotte so very plain.

4256
01:11:27,880 --> 01:11:28,880
But then she is

4257
01:11:28,880 --> 01:11:30,080
our particular friend.

4258
01:11:30,660 --> 01:11:31,220
She seems a

4259
01:11:31,220 --> 01:11:31,960
very pleasant

4260
01:11:31,960 --> 01:11:33,020
young woman.

4261
01:11:33,020 --> 01:11:33,700
Oh, dear.

4262
01:11:33,700 --> 01:11:34,920
Yes, but she must.

4263
01:11:34,920 --> 01:11:36,720
And she is very plain.

4264
01:11:37,140 --> 01:11:37,920
Lady Lucas

4265
01:11:37,920 --> 01:11:39,180
herself is often said so

4266
01:11:39,180 --> 01:11:39,920
and envied me.

4267
01:11:39,920 --> 01:11:41,100
Jane's beauty.

4268
01:11:41,100 --> 01:11:42,180
I do not like to

4269
01:11:42,180 --> 01:11:43,380
boast of my own child,

4270
01:11:43,700 --> 01:11:45,380
but to be sure, Jane

4271
01:11:45,840 --> 01:11:46,680
does not see often

4272
01:11:46,680 --> 01:11:47,880
anybody better looking.

4273
01:11:48,080 --> 01:11:48,500
It is what

4274
01:11:48,500 --> 01:11:49,700
everybody says.

4275
01:11:49,800 --> 01:11:50,720
I do not trust

4276
01:11:50,720 --> 01:11:51,920
own partiality.

4277
01:11:52,140 --> 01:11:53,700
When she was only 15.

4278
01:11:53,700 --> 01:11:54,300
There was a man

4279
01:11:54,300 --> 01:11:55,140
at my brother.

4280
01:11:55,140 --> 01:11:55,660
As in town,

4281
01:11:55,660 --> 01:11:57,020
so much in love with her

4282
01:11:57,020 --> 01:11:58,020
that my sister in law

4283
01:11:58,020 --> 01:11:58,380
was sure

4284
01:11:58,380 --> 01:11:58,920
he would make her

4285
01:11:58,920 --> 01:11:59,240
an offer

4286
01:11:59,240 --> 01:12:00,440
before we came away.

4287
01:12:00,720 --> 01:12:01,920
But however, he did not.

4288
01:12:01,960 --> 01:12:02,700
Perhaps he thought

4289
01:12:02,700 --> 01:12:03,660
that in Young.

4290
01:12:03,660 --> 01:12:04,080
However,

4291
01:12:04,080 --> 01:12:05,060
he wrote some verses

4292
01:12:05,060 --> 01:12:06,240
on her. And very pretty.

4293
01:12:06,240 --> 01:12:07,440
They were.

4294
01:12:07,560 --> 01:12:08,660
And so ended

4295
01:12:08,660 --> 01:12:09,760
his affection.

4296
01:12:09,760 --> 01:12:10,460
Said Elizabeth.

4297
01:12:10,460 --> 01:12:11,580
Impatiently.

4298
01:12:11,580 --> 01:12:12,500
There has been many

4299
01:12:12,500 --> 01:12:13,700
when I fancy overcome

4300
01:12:13,700 --> 01:12:14,900
in the same way.

4301
01:12:14,900 --> 01:12:15,300
I wonder

4302
01:12:15,300 --> 01:12:16,400
who first discovered

4303
01:12:16,400 --> 01:12:17,720
the efficacy of poetry

4304
01:12:17,720 --> 01:12:19,040
in driving away Love.

4305
01:12:20,120 --> 01:12:20,580
I have been

4306
01:12:20,580 --> 01:12:21,620
used to consider poetry

4307
01:12:21,620 --> 01:12:22,820
as the food of love.

4308
01:12:23,040 --> 01:12:24,240
Said Darcy,

4309
01:12:25,100 --> 01:12:26,420
of a fine, stout,

4310
01:12:26,420 --> 01:12:27,120
healthy love.

4311
01:12:27,120 --> 01:12:27,920
It may.

4312
01:12:27,920 --> 01:12:29,100
Everything nourishes

4313
01:12:29,100 --> 01:12:30,340
what is strong already.

4314
01:12:30,720 --> 01:12:31,260
But if it be

4315
01:12:31,260 --> 01:12:32,760
only a slight thin

4316
01:12:32,760 --> 01:12:33,960
sort of inclination,

4317
01:12:34,100 --> 01:12:35,380
I am convinced that one

4318
01:12:35,380 --> 01:12:36,120
good sonnet

4319
01:12:36,120 --> 01:12:37,400
will starve it entirely

4320
01:12:37,400 --> 01:12:38,600
away.

4321
01:12:39,880 --> 01:12:40,420
Darcy

4322
01:12:40,420 --> 01:12:41,640
only smiled,

4323
01:12:41,760 --> 01:12:42,920
and the general pause

4324
01:12:42,920 --> 01:12:43,640
which ensued

4325
01:12:43,640 --> 01:12:44,260
made Elizabeth

4326
01:12:44,260 --> 01:12:45,020
tremble, lest

4327
01:12:45,020 --> 01:12:45,420
her mother

4328
01:12:45,420 --> 01:12:45,660
should be

4329
01:12:45,660 --> 01:12:46,940
exposing herself again.

4330
01:12:48,380 --> 01:12:49,580
She longs to speak,

4331
01:12:49,580 --> 01:12:50,120
but could think of

4332
01:12:50,120 --> 01:12:51,320
nothing to say.

4333
01:12:51,980 --> 01:12:52,840
And after a short

4334
01:12:52,840 --> 01:12:53,640
silence, Mrs.

4335
01:12:53,640 --> 01:12:54,200
Bennet began

4336
01:12:54,200 --> 01:12:54,800
repeating her

4337
01:12:54,800 --> 01:12:55,520
thanks to Mr.

4338
01:12:55,520 --> 01:12:56,660
Bingley for his kindness

4339
01:12:56,660 --> 01:12:57,440
to Jane

4340
01:12:57,440 --> 01:12:58,220
with an apology

4341
01:12:58,220 --> 01:12:58,920
for troubling him.

4342
01:12:58,920 --> 01:13:00,120
Also with Lizzie.

4343
01:13:00,720 --> 01:13:01,100
Mr.

4344
01:13:01,100 --> 01:13:02,260
Bingley was unaffected,

4345
01:13:02,260 --> 01:13:02,900
least civil

4346
01:13:02,900 --> 01:13:03,880
in his answer,

4347
01:13:03,880 --> 01:13:04,580
and forced

4348
01:13:04,580 --> 01:13:05,380
his younger sister

4349
01:13:05,380 --> 01:13:06,600
to be civil also.

4350
01:13:06,760 --> 01:13:07,580
And say what?

4351
01:13:07,580 --> 01:13:08,800
The occasion required.

4352
01:13:09,200 --> 01:13:10,140
She performed her

4353
01:13:10,140 --> 01:13:10,920
part indeed

4354
01:13:10,920 --> 01:13:11,300
without

4355
01:13:11,300 --> 01:13:12,500
much graciousness.

4356
01:13:12,560 --> 01:13:13,100
But Mrs.

4357
01:13:13,100 --> 01:13:14,340
Bennet was satisfied

4358
01:13:14,600 --> 01:13:15,720
and soon afterwards

4359
01:13:15,720 --> 01:13:16,920
ordered her carriage

4360
01:13:17,180 --> 01:13:18,340
upon this,

4361
01:13:18,340 --> 01:13:18,980
the youngest of

4362
01:13:18,980 --> 01:13:19,560
her daughters

4363
01:13:19,560 --> 01:13:20,760
put herself forward.

4364
01:13:20,900 --> 01:13:21,300
The two

4365
01:13:21,300 --> 01:13:21,740
girls had

4366
01:13:21,740 --> 01:13:22,400
been whispering

4367
01:13:22,400 --> 01:13:22,880
to each other

4368
01:13:22,880 --> 01:13:24,080
during the whole visit,

4369
01:13:24,180 --> 01:13:25,100
and the result of it

4370
01:13:25,100 --> 01:13:25,760
was that

4371
01:13:25,760 --> 01:13:26,660
the youngest should

4372
01:13:26,660 --> 01:13:27,380
tax Mr.

4373
01:13:27,380 --> 01:13:28,740
Bingley, having promised

4374
01:13:28,740 --> 01:13:29,380
on his first

4375
01:13:29,380 --> 01:13:30,600
coming into the county

4376
01:13:30,720 --> 01:13:31,520
to give a ball

4377
01:13:31,520 --> 01:13:32,720
at another field.

4378
01:13:33,080 --> 01:13:34,340
Lydia was a stout,

4379
01:13:34,340 --> 01:13:36,000
well grown girl of 15

4380
01:13:36,200 --> 01:13:37,460
with a fine complexion

4381
01:13:37,460 --> 01:13:37,840
and good

4382
01:13:37,840 --> 01:13:39,060
humored countenance,

4383
01:13:39,180 --> 01:13:40,140
a favorite with her

4384
01:13:40,140 --> 01:13:41,540
mother whose affection

4385
01:13:41,540 --> 01:13:42,120
had brought her

4386
01:13:42,120 --> 01:13:42,740
into public

4387
01:13:42,740 --> 01:13:43,940
at an early age.

4388
01:13:44,100 --> 01:13:44,540
She had.

4389
01:13:44,540 --> 01:13:45,880
High animal spirits

4390
01:13:46,100 --> 01:13:47,220
and a sort of natural

4391
01:13:47,220 --> 01:13:48,420
self consequence.

4392
01:13:48,460 --> 01:13:49,420
Which the attention

4393
01:13:49,420 --> 01:13:49,640
of the.

4394
01:13:49,640 --> 01:13:50,420
Officers

4395
01:13:50,420 --> 01:13:51,320
to whom her uncle's

4396
01:13:51,320 --> 01:13:51,960
good dinners

4397
01:13:51,960 --> 01:13:52,800
and her own easy

4398
01:13:52,800 --> 01:13:54,000
manners recommended her,

4399
01:13:54,140 --> 01:13:55,020
had increased

4400
01:13:55,020 --> 01:13:56,220
into assurance.

4401
01:13:56,300 --> 01:13:57,480
She was very equal.

4402
01:13:57,480 --> 01:13:58,140
Therefore, to

4403
01:13:58,140 --> 01:13:58,760
address Mr.

4404
01:13:58,760 --> 01:13:59,160
Bingley

4405
01:13:59,160 --> 01:13:59,780
on the subject

4406
01:13:59,780 --> 01:14:01,220
of the ball and abruptly

4407
01:14:01,220 --> 01:14:01,920
reminded him

4408
01:14:01,920 --> 01:14:03,480
of his promise, adding

4409
01:14:03,480 --> 01:14:03,900
that it would be

4410
01:14:03,900 --> 01:14:04,700
the most shameful

4411
01:14:04,700 --> 01:14:05,300
thing in the world

4412
01:14:05,300 --> 01:14:06,500
if he did not keep it.

4413
01:14:06,720 --> 01:14:07,700
His answer to this

4414
01:14:07,700 --> 01:14:08,520
sudden attack

4415
01:14:08,520 --> 01:14:09,180
was delightful

4416
01:14:09,180 --> 01:14:10,380
to their mother's ear.

4417
01:14:10,820 --> 01:14:12,120
I am perfectly ready,

4418
01:14:12,120 --> 01:14:12,680
I assure you,

4419
01:14:12,680 --> 01:14:13,880
to keep my engagement.

4420
01:14:14,160 --> 01:14:15,080
And when your sister

4421
01:14:15,080 --> 01:14:16,620
is recovered, you shall,

4422
01:14:16,620 --> 01:14:17,460
if you please, name

4423
01:14:17,460 --> 01:14:18,080
the very day

4424
01:14:18,080 --> 01:14:18,960
of the ball.

4425
01:14:18,960 --> 01:14:20,000
But you would not wish

4426
01:14:20,000 --> 01:14:20,660
to be dancing

4427
01:14:20,660 --> 01:14:21,860
when she is ill.

4428
01:14:22,160 --> 01:14:22,940
Lydia declared

4429
01:14:22,940 --> 01:14:24,140
herself satisfied.

4430
01:14:24,480 --> 01:14:25,280
Oh, yes.

4431
01:14:25,280 --> 01:14:25,920
It would be much.

4432
01:14:25,920 --> 01:14:26,520
Better to wait

4433
01:14:26,520 --> 01:14:27,720
till Jane was well.

4434
01:14:27,780 --> 01:14:29,000
And by that time, most

4435
01:14:29,000 --> 01:14:29,340
likely,

4436
01:14:29,340 --> 01:14:30,360
Captain Carter would be.

4437
01:14:30,360 --> 01:14:31,460
At Maritain again.

4438
01:14:31,460 --> 01:14:32,360
And when you have given

4439
01:14:32,360 --> 01:14:33,900
your ball, she added,

4440
01:14:34,160 --> 01:14:35,540
I shall insist on there

4441
01:14:35,540 --> 01:14:36,740
giving one also.

4442
01:14:36,800 --> 01:14:37,460
I shall tell

4443
01:14:37,460 --> 01:14:38,280
Colonel Foster.

4444
01:14:38,280 --> 01:14:38,520
It would be

4445
01:14:38,520 --> 01:14:39,200
quite a shame

4446
01:14:39,200 --> 01:14:40,400
if he does not.

4447
01:14:40,740 --> 01:14:41,160
Mrs.

4448
01:14:41,160 --> 01:14:42,300
Bennet and her daughters

4449
01:14:42,300 --> 01:14:43,340
then departed

4450
01:14:43,340 --> 01:14:44,540
and Elizabeth returned

4451
01:14:44,540 --> 01:14:45,740
instantly to Jane

4452
01:14:45,900 --> 01:14:46,800
leaving her own

4453
01:14:46,800 --> 01:14:47,640
and her relations

4454
01:14:47,640 --> 01:14:48,800
behavior to the remarks

4455
01:14:48,800 --> 01:14:48,980
of the

4456
01:14:48,980 --> 01:14:50,040
two ladies and Mr.

4457
01:14:50,040 --> 01:14:50,940
Darcy,

4458
01:14:50,940 --> 01:14:51,920
the latter of whom,

4459
01:14:51,920 --> 01:14:52,800
however, could not

4460
01:14:52,800 --> 01:14:53,960
be prevailed on to join

4461
01:14:53,960 --> 01:14:55,160
in their censure of her.

4462
01:14:55,440 --> 01:14:55,980
In spite

4463
01:14:55,980 --> 01:14:56,960
of all Miss Bingley.

4464
01:14:56,960 --> 01:14:59,240
Witticisms on Fine Eyes.

4465
01:15:00,800 --> 01:15:02,000
Chapter ten.

4466
01:15:03,240 --> 01:15:04,140
The day passed

4467
01:15:04,140 --> 01:15:04,800
much as the day

4468
01:15:04,800 --> 01:15:06,000
before had done.

4469
01:15:06,060 --> 01:15:06,440
Mrs.

4470
01:15:06,440 --> 01:15:07,680
Hurst and Miss Bingley

4471
01:15:07,680 --> 01:15:08,720
had spent some hours

4472
01:15:08,720 --> 01:15:09,240
of the morning

4473
01:15:09,240 --> 01:15:10,220
with the invalid,

4474
01:15:10,220 --> 01:15:11,240
who continued, though

4475
01:15:11,240 --> 01:15:12,440
slowly to mend.

4476
01:15:12,680 --> 01:15:13,140
And in the.

4477
01:15:13,140 --> 01:15:13,500
Evening

4478
01:15:13,500 --> 01:15:14,280
Elizabeth joined

4479
01:15:14,280 --> 01:15:14,900
their party

4480
01:15:14,900 --> 01:15:16,020
the drawing room.

4481
01:15:16,020 --> 01:15:16,700
The loo table,

4482
01:15:16,700 --> 01:15:17,900
however, did not appear.

4483
01:15:18,080 --> 01:15:18,440
Mr.

4484
01:15:18,440 --> 01:15:19,640
Darcy was writing

4485
01:15:19,680 --> 01:15:20,060
and Ms..

4486
01:15:20,060 --> 01:15:20,960
Bingley, seated

4487
01:15:20,960 --> 01:15:21,620
near him,

4488
01:15:21,620 --> 01:15:22,220
was watching

4489
01:15:22,220 --> 01:15:22,760
the progress

4490
01:15:22,760 --> 01:15:23,340
of his letter

4491
01:15:23,340 --> 01:15:23,960
and repeatedly

4492
01:15:23,960 --> 01:15:24,620
calling off

4493
01:15:24,620 --> 01:15:25,800
attention by messages

4494
01:15:25,800 --> 01:15:27,000
to his sister.

4495
01:15:27,020 --> 01:15:27,380
Mr.

4496
01:15:27,380 --> 01:15:28,140
Hurst and Mr.

4497
01:15:28,140 --> 01:15:29,340
Bingley were at peak

4498
01:15:29,520 --> 01:15:30,060
and Mrs.

4499
01:15:30,060 --> 01:15:30,960
Hurst was observing

4500
01:15:30,960 --> 01:15:32,160
their game.

4501
01:15:32,340 --> 01:15:32,880
Elizabeth

4502
01:15:32,880 --> 01:15:34,080
took up some needlework

4503
01:15:34,140 --> 01:15:35,460
and sufficiently amused

4504
01:15:35,460 --> 01:15:35,960
and attending

4505
01:15:35,960 --> 01:15:36,660
to what passed

4506
01:15:36,660 --> 01:15:37,280
between Darcy

4507
01:15:37,280 --> 01:15:38,480
and his companion.

4508
01:15:38,480 --> 01:15:39,200
The perpetual

4509
01:15:39,200 --> 01:15:39,920
commendations

4510
01:15:39,920 --> 01:15:40,760
of the lady

4511
01:15:40,760 --> 01:15:41,160
either

4512
01:15:41,160 --> 01:15:42,420
on his handwriting or

4513
01:15:42,420 --> 01:15:43,140
on the evenness

4514
01:15:43,140 --> 01:15:43,940
of the lines,

4515
01:15:43,940 --> 01:15:44,660
or on the length

4516
01:15:44,660 --> 01:15:45,360
of his letter

4517
01:15:45,360 --> 01:15:46,200
with the perfect

4518
01:15:46,200 --> 01:15:46,860
unconcern

4519
01:15:46,860 --> 01:15:47,700
with which her praises

4520
01:15:47,700 --> 01:15:48,660
were received.

4521
01:15:48,660 --> 01:15:50,360
Formed a curious dialog

4522
01:15:50,540 --> 01:15:52,080
and was exactly in union

4523
01:15:52,080 --> 01:15:52,320
with her

4524
01:15:52,320 --> 01:15:53,520
opinion of each.

4525
01:15:54,180 --> 01:15:55,700
How delighted Ms..

4526
01:15:55,700 --> 01:15:56,160
Darcy

4527
01:15:56,160 --> 01:15:57,420
would be to receive such

4528
01:15:57,420 --> 01:15:58,620
a letter.

4529
01:15:58,980 --> 01:16:00,080
He made no answer.

4530
01:16:01,140 --> 01:16:01,680
You write

4531
01:16:01,680 --> 01:16:03,200
uncommonly fast.

4532
01:16:04,340 --> 01:16:05,360
You are mistaken.

4533
01:16:05,360 --> 01:16:06,560
I write rather slowly.

4534
01:16:07,700 --> 01:16:08,880
How many letters

4535
01:16:08,880 --> 01:16:09,680
you must have occasion

4536
01:16:09,680 --> 01:16:10,040
to write

4537
01:16:10,040 --> 01:16:11,240
in the course of a year.

4538
01:16:11,340 --> 01:16:12,720
That is a business too.

4539
01:16:13,040 --> 01:16:13,980
How odious

4540
01:16:13,980 --> 01:16:15,180
I should think I am.

4541
01:16:16,200 --> 01:16:17,000
It is fortunate

4542
01:16:17,000 --> 01:16:17,420
then that

4543
01:16:17,420 --> 01:16:18,360
they fall to my lot

4544
01:16:18,360 --> 01:16:19,560
instead of to yours.

4545
01:16:20,400 --> 01:16:21,660
And I tell your sister

4546
01:16:21,840 --> 01:16:23,180
that I long to her.

4547
01:16:24,000 --> 01:16:25,000
I have already told you

4548
01:16:25,000 --> 01:16:26,400
so once by your desire.

4549
01:16:27,680 --> 01:16:28,380
I am afraid

4550
01:16:28,380 --> 01:16:28,580
you do

4551
01:16:28,580 --> 01:16:29,780
not like your pen.

4552
01:16:29,820 --> 01:16:31,220
Let me mend it for you.

4553
01:16:31,560 --> 01:16:32,700
I mend pens

4554
01:16:32,700 --> 01:16:33,920
remarkably well.

4555
01:16:34,260 --> 01:16:34,960
Thank you.

4556
01:16:34,960 --> 01:16:35,600
But I always

4557
01:16:35,600 --> 01:16:36,800
mend my own.

4558
01:16:37,220 --> 01:16:38,680
How come you can drive

4559
01:16:38,700 --> 01:16:39,080
to write?

4560
01:16:39,080 --> 01:16:40,380
So even.

4561
01:16:41,160 --> 01:16:42,360
He was silent.

4562
01:16:43,140 --> 01:16:44,340
Tell your sister

4563
01:16:44,460 --> 01:16:45,600
I am delighted

4564
01:16:45,600 --> 01:16:45,860
to hear

4565
01:16:45,860 --> 01:16:46,640
of her improvement

4566
01:16:46,640 --> 01:16:48,240
on the harp and pray.

4567
01:16:48,240 --> 01:16:48,960
Let her know that

4568
01:16:48,960 --> 01:16:50,700
I am quite in raptures

4569
01:16:50,700 --> 01:16:50,940
with her

4570
01:16:50,940 --> 01:16:51,600
beautiful little

4571
01:16:51,600 --> 01:16:52,800
design for a table

4572
01:16:52,940 --> 01:16:53,580
and I think it

4573
01:16:53,580 --> 01:16:54,780
infinitely superior to

4574
01:16:54,780 --> 01:16:55,680
Miss Grant. Please.

4575
01:16:57,060 --> 01:16:57,560
Will you give

4576
01:16:57,560 --> 01:16:58,020
me leave to

4577
01:16:58,020 --> 01:16:58,980
defer your raptures

4578
01:16:58,980 --> 01:17:00,180
till I write again?

4579
01:17:01,140 --> 01:17:01,660
A present.

4580
01:17:01,660 --> 01:17:02,100
I have not

4581
01:17:02,100 --> 01:17:03,300
room to do them justice.

4582
01:17:03,800 --> 01:17:04,620
No,

4583
01:17:04,620 --> 01:17:05,820
it is of no consequence.

4584
01:17:06,000 --> 01:17:06,780
I shall see her

4585
01:17:06,780 --> 01:17:07,980
in January.

4586
01:17:08,120 --> 01:17:09,500
But do you always write

4587
01:17:09,500 --> 01:17:10,340
such charming

4588
01:17:10,340 --> 01:17:11,540
long letters to her, Mr.

4589
01:17:11,540 --> 01:17:12,740
Darcy?

4590
01:17:13,020 --> 01:17:14,220
They are generally long,

4591
01:17:14,480 --> 01:17:14,900
but weather

4592
01:17:14,900 --> 01:17:15,660
always charming.

4593
01:17:15,660 --> 01:17:16,320
It is not for me

4594
01:17:16,320 --> 01:17:17,520
to determine.

4595
01:17:17,780 --> 01:17:19,140
It is a rule with me

4596
01:17:19,340 --> 01:17:20,040
that a person

4597
01:17:20,040 --> 01:17:20,540
who can write

4598
01:17:20,540 --> 01:17:21,660
a long letter with ease

4599
01:17:21,660 --> 01:17:22,980
cannot write ill.

4600
01:17:24,200 --> 01:17:24,980
That will not do

4601
01:17:24,980 --> 01:17:25,560
for a compliment

4602
01:17:25,560 --> 01:17:26,000
to Darcy.

4603
01:17:26,000 --> 01:17:26,820
Caroline.

4604
01:17:26,820 --> 01:17:27,960
Cried her brother.

4605
01:17:27,960 --> 01:17:28,500
Because he does

4606
01:17:28,500 --> 01:17:29,700
not write with ease.

4607
01:17:30,420 --> 01:17:31,280
He studies too

4608
01:17:31,280 --> 01:17:31,680
for words

4609
01:17:31,680 --> 01:17:32,880
of four syllables.

4610
01:17:32,940 --> 01:17:34,140
Do not you, Darcy?

4611
01:17:35,100 --> 01:17:36,020
My style of writing

4612
01:17:36,020 --> 01:17:36,780
is very different

4613
01:17:36,780 --> 01:17:37,980
from yours.

4614
01:17:38,280 --> 01:17:39,360
No.

4615
01:17:39,360 --> 01:17:40,560
Cried Miss Bingley.

4616
01:17:40,640 --> 01:17:41,400
Charles writes

4617
01:17:41,400 --> 01:17:41,760
in the most

4618
01:17:41,760 --> 01:17:43,200
callous way imaginable.

4619
01:17:43,340 --> 01:17:44,100
He leaves out

4620
01:17:44,100 --> 01:17:45,560
half his words and plots

4621
01:17:45,560 --> 01:17:46,760
the rest.

4622
01:17:47,060 --> 01:17:48,900
My ideas flow so rapidly

4623
01:17:48,900 --> 01:17:49,700
that I have not time

4624
01:17:49,700 --> 01:17:50,900
to express them.

4625
01:17:51,240 --> 01:17:51,800
By which means

4626
01:17:51,800 --> 01:17:52,280
my letters

4627
01:17:52,280 --> 01:17:53,000
sometimes convey

4628
01:17:53,000 --> 01:17:53,660
no ideas

4629
01:17:53,660 --> 01:17:54,060
at all to

4630
01:17:54,060 --> 01:17:54,960
my correspondence.

4631
01:17:56,220 --> 01:17:57,320
Your humility, Mr.

4632
01:17:57,320 --> 01:17:58,880
Bingley said Elizabeth

4633
01:17:59,340 --> 01:18:00,260
must disarm

4634
01:18:00,260 --> 01:18:01,460
reproof.

4635
01:18:02,180 --> 01:18:02,660
Nothing is

4636
01:18:02,660 --> 01:18:03,840
more deceitful.

4637
01:18:03,840 --> 01:18:05,000
Said Darcy.

4638
01:18:05,000 --> 01:18:05,880
Than the appearance

4639
01:18:05,880 --> 01:18:06,960
of humility.

4640
01:18:06,960 --> 01:18:07,940
It is often only

4641
01:18:07,940 --> 01:18:09,140
carelessness of opinion

4642
01:18:09,420 --> 01:18:10,380
and sometimes an

4643
01:18:10,380 --> 01:18:11,580
indirect boast.

4644
01:18:12,480 --> 01:18:13,340
And which of the two

4645
01:18:13,340 --> 01:18:13,800
do you call?

4646
01:18:13,800 --> 01:18:14,700
My little recent

4647
01:18:14,700 --> 01:18:15,900
piece of modesty.

4648
01:18:16,380 --> 01:18:17,580
The indirect boast

4649
01:18:17,840 --> 01:18:18,740
for your really proud

4650
01:18:18,740 --> 01:18:19,400
of your defects

4651
01:18:19,400 --> 01:18:19,880
in writing

4652
01:18:19,880 --> 01:18:20,300
because you

4653
01:18:20,300 --> 01:18:21,000
consider them

4654
01:18:21,000 --> 01:18:21,800
as proceeding

4655
01:18:21,800 --> 01:18:22,580
from a rapidity

4656
01:18:22,580 --> 01:18:23,100
of thought

4657
01:18:23,100 --> 01:18:23,820
and carelessness

4658
01:18:23,820 --> 01:18:25,020
of execution,

4659
01:18:26,220 --> 01:18:26,700
which,

4660
01:18:26,700 --> 01:18:27,900
if not estimable,

4661
01:18:28,440 --> 01:18:29,460
you think at least

4662
01:18:29,460 --> 01:18:30,660
highly interesting.

4663
01:18:31,260 --> 01:18:31,820
The power of

4664
01:18:31,820 --> 01:18:32,360
doing anything

4665
01:18:32,360 --> 01:18:33,020
with quickness

4666
01:18:33,020 --> 01:18:34,580
is always much prized

4667
01:18:34,580 --> 01:18:35,780
by the possessor

4668
01:18:36,800 --> 01:18:37,320
and often

4669
01:18:37,320 --> 01:18:38,300
without any attention

4670
01:18:38,300 --> 01:18:39,140
to the imperfection

4671
01:18:39,140 --> 01:18:40,340
of the performance.

4672
01:18:41,760 --> 01:18:42,660
When you told Mrs.

4673
01:18:42,660 --> 01:18:43,860
Bennet this morning

4674
01:18:43,980 --> 01:18:44,420
that if you

4675
01:18:44,420 --> 01:18:45,020
ever resolved

4676
01:18:45,020 --> 01:18:46,040
on quitting Netherfield,

4677
01:18:46,040 --> 01:18:46,680
you should be gone

4678
01:18:46,680 --> 01:18:47,880
in 5 minutes.

4679
01:18:48,240 --> 01:18:48,960
You meant it to be

4680
01:18:48,960 --> 01:18:50,160
a sort of panegyric

4681
01:18:50,480 --> 01:18:51,200
of complement

4682
01:18:51,200 --> 01:18:52,400
to yourself.

4683
01:18:52,500 --> 01:18:53,180
And yet,

4684
01:18:53,180 --> 01:18:53,760
what is there

4685
01:18:53,760 --> 01:18:54,980
so very laudable

4686
01:18:54,980 --> 01:18:56,000
in a precipitous

4687
01:18:56,000 --> 01:18:56,700
which must leave

4688
01:18:56,700 --> 01:18:57,560
very necessary

4689
01:18:57,560 --> 01:18:58,680
business undone

4690
01:18:58,680 --> 01:18:59,240
and can be of

4691
01:18:59,240 --> 01:19:00,320
no real advantage

4692
01:19:00,320 --> 01:19:01,040
to yourself

4693
01:19:01,040 --> 01:19:02,060
or anyone else?

4694
01:19:02,060 --> 01:19:03,320
Nay, cried Bingley.

4695
01:19:03,720 --> 01:19:04,560
This is too much

4696
01:19:04,560 --> 01:19:05,420
to remember at night

4697
01:19:05,420 --> 01:19:06,560
all the foolish things

4698
01:19:06,560 --> 01:19:07,080
that were said

4699
01:19:07,080 --> 01:19:08,280
in the morning.

4700
01:19:08,580 --> 01:19:09,600
And yet, upon my honor,

4701
01:19:09,600 --> 01:19:10,520
I believed what I said

4702
01:19:10,520 --> 01:19:11,720
of myself to be true.

4703
01:19:12,020 --> 01:19:12,780
And I believe it

4704
01:19:12,780 --> 01:19:13,980
at this moment

4705
01:19:14,420 --> 01:19:14,900
at least.

4706
01:19:14,900 --> 01:19:15,240
Therefore,

4707
01:19:15,240 --> 01:19:16,100
I did not assume

4708
01:19:16,100 --> 01:19:16,760
the character

4709
01:19:16,760 --> 01:19:17,960
of needless precipitant

4710
01:19:18,480 --> 01:19:19,320
merely to show off

4711
01:19:19,320 --> 01:19:20,180
before the ladies.

4712
01:19:21,680 --> 01:19:22,280
I daresay you

4713
01:19:22,280 --> 01:19:23,480
believed it,

4714
01:19:23,700 --> 01:19:24,560
but I am by no means

4715
01:19:24,560 --> 01:19:25,140
convinced that

4716
01:19:25,140 --> 01:19:25,740
you would be gone

4717
01:19:25,740 --> 01:19:26,940
with such celerity.

4718
01:19:28,560 --> 01:19:29,240
Your conduct

4719
01:19:29,240 --> 01:19:29,760
would be quite

4720
01:19:29,760 --> 01:19:30,840
as dependent on chance

4721
01:19:30,840 --> 01:19:31,320
as that of

4722
01:19:31,320 --> 01:19:32,520
any man I know.

4723
01:19:34,100 --> 01:19:35,180
And if,

4724
01:19:35,180 --> 01:19:36,020
as you were mounting

4725
01:19:36,020 --> 01:19:36,480
your horse,

4726
01:19:36,480 --> 01:19:37,680
a friend were to say

4727
01:19:38,180 --> 01:19:39,060
Bingley,

4728
01:19:39,060 --> 01:19:39,740
you'd better

4729
01:19:39,740 --> 01:19:40,940
till next week.

4730
01:19:40,940 --> 01:19:41,220
You would

4731
01:19:41,220 --> 01:19:42,000
probably do it.

4732
01:19:42,000 --> 01:19:42,260
You would

4733
01:19:42,260 --> 01:19:43,460
probably not go,

4734
01:19:43,940 --> 01:19:45,180
and at another word

4735
01:19:45,240 --> 01:19:46,440
might stay a month.

4736
01:19:46,920 --> 01:19:47,460
You've only

4737
01:19:47,460 --> 01:19:48,680
proved by this.

4738
01:19:48,840 --> 01:19:50,040
Cried Elizabeth.

4739
01:19:50,160 --> 01:19:50,700
That Mr.

4740
01:19:50,700 --> 01:19:51,120
Bingley did

4741
01:19:51,120 --> 01:19:51,960
not do justice

4742
01:19:51,960 --> 01:19:53,160
to his own disposition.

4743
01:19:53,460 --> 01:19:54,480
You have shown him off

4744
01:19:54,480 --> 01:19:55,760
now much more than he

4745
01:19:55,760 --> 01:19:56,960
did himself.

4746
01:19:57,000 --> 01:19:57,960
I am exceedingly

4747
01:19:57,960 --> 01:19:59,000
gratified, said

4748
01:19:59,000 --> 01:19:59,700
Bingley by,

4749
01:19:59,700 --> 01:20:00,420
Your converting

4750
01:20:00,420 --> 01:20:01,280
what my friend says

4751
01:20:01,280 --> 01:20:02,280
into a compliment

4752
01:20:02,280 --> 01:20:02,940
on the sweetness

4753
01:20:02,940 --> 01:20:04,080
of my temper.

4754
01:20:04,080 --> 01:20:04,760
But I'm afraid

4755
01:20:04,760 --> 01:20:05,240
you are giving it

4756
01:20:05,240 --> 01:20:05,660
a turn,

4757
01:20:05,660 --> 01:20:06,480
which that gentleman

4758
01:20:06,480 --> 01:20:07,580
did by no means intend

4759
01:20:09,260 --> 01:20:09,440
for.

4760
01:20:09,440 --> 01:20:09,980
He would certainly

4761
01:20:09,980 --> 01:20:10,760
think the better of me

4762
01:20:10,760 --> 01:20:11,420
if under such

4763
01:20:11,420 --> 01:20:12,120
a circumstance

4764
01:20:12,120 --> 01:20:12,620
I were to give

4765
01:20:12,620 --> 01:20:13,340
a flat denial

4766
01:20:13,340 --> 01:20:13,860
and to write off

4767
01:20:13,860 --> 01:20:15,060
as fast as I could.

4768
01:20:17,420 --> 01:20:17,880
Would Mr.

4769
01:20:17,880 --> 01:20:18,420
D'Arcy then.

4770
01:20:18,420 --> 01:20:19,380
Consider the rashness

4771
01:20:19,380 --> 01:20:19,560
of your

4772
01:20:19,560 --> 01:20:20,520
original intentions

4773
01:20:20,520 --> 01:20:21,600
as it turned for

4774
01:20:21,600 --> 01:20:22,680
by your obstinacy

4775
01:20:22,680 --> 01:20:23,880
in adhering to it?

4776
01:20:24,360 --> 01:20:25,100
Upon my word,

4777
01:20:25,100 --> 01:20:26,040
I cannot exactly

4778
01:20:26,040 --> 01:20:27,240
explain the matter.

4779
01:20:27,420 --> 01:20:28,320
Darcy must speak

4780
01:20:28,320 --> 01:20:29,520
for himself.

4781
01:20:31,680 --> 01:20:32,880
You expect me to account

4782
01:20:32,880 --> 01:20:33,440
for opinions

4783
01:20:33,440 --> 01:20:33,740
which you

4784
01:20:33,740 --> 01:20:34,940
choose to call mine,

4785
01:20:35,040 --> 01:20:35,660
but which I have

4786
01:20:35,660 --> 01:20:36,860
never acknowledged.

4787
01:20:37,140 --> 01:20:37,940
Allowing the case,

4788
01:20:37,940 --> 01:20:38,700
however, to stand

4789
01:20:38,700 --> 01:20:39,240
according to

4790
01:20:39,240 --> 01:20:40,440
your representation.

4791
01:20:41,360 --> 01:20:41,840
You must

4792
01:20:41,840 --> 01:20:43,040
remember, Miss Bennet,

4793
01:20:43,080 --> 01:20:43,700
that the friend

4794
01:20:43,700 --> 01:20:44,340
who who's supposed

4795
01:20:44,340 --> 01:20:44,780
to decide

4796
01:20:44,780 --> 01:20:45,980
his return to the house

4797
01:20:46,640 --> 01:20:47,240
and the delay

4798
01:20:47,240 --> 01:20:48,060
of his plan

4799
01:20:48,060 --> 01:20:49,260
has merely desired it.

4800
01:20:50,100 --> 01:20:50,580
Asked it

4801
01:20:50,580 --> 01:20:51,240
without offering

4802
01:20:51,240 --> 01:20:51,980
one argument in

4803
01:20:51,980 --> 01:20:53,220
favor of its propriety.

4804
01:20:54,720 --> 01:20:55,260
To yield

4805
01:20:55,260 --> 01:20:56,600
readily, easily

4806
01:20:56,600 --> 01:20:57,440
to the persuasion

4807
01:20:57,440 --> 01:20:57,900
of a friend.

4808
01:20:57,900 --> 01:20:59,120
Is no merit with you.

4809
01:21:00,380 --> 01:21:00,900
To yield

4810
01:21:00,900 --> 01:21:02,040
without conviction

4811
01:21:02,040 --> 01:21:02,900
is no compliment

4812
01:21:02,900 --> 01:21:03,780
to the understanding

4813
01:21:03,780 --> 01:21:04,980
of either.

4814
01:21:06,320 --> 01:21:07,500
You appear to me, Mr.

4815
01:21:07,500 --> 01:21:08,780
Darcy, to allow nothing

4816
01:21:08,780 --> 01:21:09,500
for the influence

4817
01:21:09,500 --> 01:21:10,280
of friendship

4818
01:21:10,280 --> 01:21:11,480
and affection.

4819
01:21:11,520 --> 01:21:12,240
Of regard

4820
01:21:12,240 --> 01:21:12,900
for the request.

4821
01:21:12,900 --> 01:21:13,440
I would often

4822
01:21:13,440 --> 01:21:14,780
make one readily yield

4823
01:21:14,780 --> 01:21:16,040
to a request without

4824
01:21:16,400 --> 01:21:17,480
for arguments to reason

4825
01:21:17,480 --> 01:21:18,680
one into it.

4826
01:21:18,800 --> 01:21:19,980
I am not particularly

4827
01:21:19,980 --> 01:21:21,000
speaking of such a case

4828
01:21:21,000 --> 01:21:21,720
as you have supposed

4829
01:21:21,720 --> 01:21:22,140
about Mr.

4830
01:21:22,140 --> 01:21:23,000
Bingley.

4831
01:21:23,000 --> 01:21:24,180
We may as well wait.

4832
01:21:24,180 --> 01:21:24,780
Perhaps till

4833
01:21:24,780 --> 01:21:25,620
the circumstance.

4834
01:21:25,620 --> 01:21:26,060
Occurs

4835
01:21:26,060 --> 01:21:26,780
before we discuss

4836
01:21:26,780 --> 01:21:27,320
the discretion

4837
01:21:27,320 --> 01:21:27,980
of his behavior

4838
01:21:27,980 --> 01:21:29,180
thereupon.

4839
01:21:29,240 --> 01:21:30,240
But in general,

4840
01:21:30,240 --> 01:21:31,500
and ordinary cases

4841
01:21:31,500 --> 01:21:32,280
between friend

4842
01:21:32,280 --> 01:21:33,480
and friend, where

4843
01:21:33,480 --> 01:21:34,460
one of them is desired

4844
01:21:34,460 --> 01:21:34,940
by the other

4845
01:21:34,940 --> 01:21:35,960
to change a resolution

4846
01:21:35,960 --> 01:21:37,160
of no very great moment,

4847
01:21:37,680 --> 01:21:38,240
should you think

4848
01:21:38,240 --> 01:21:39,300
ill of that person

4849
01:21:39,300 --> 01:21:39,960
for complying

4850
01:21:39,960 --> 01:21:41,300
with a desire without

4851
01:21:41,300 --> 01:21:41,880
waiting to be

4852
01:21:41,880 --> 01:21:42,860
argued into it?

4853
01:21:45,300 --> 01:21:45,980
Will it not be

4854
01:21:45,980 --> 01:21:46,620
advisable

4855
01:21:46,620 --> 01:21:47,460
before we proceed

4856
01:21:47,460 --> 01:21:48,660
on this subject,

4857
01:21:48,660 --> 01:21:49,320
to arrange

4858
01:21:49,320 --> 01:21:49,820
with rather

4859
01:21:49,820 --> 01:21:50,840
more precision

4860
01:21:50,840 --> 01:21:51,980
the degree of importance

4861
01:21:51,980 --> 01:21:52,400
which is to

4862
01:21:52,400 --> 01:21:53,040
appertaining to

4863
01:21:53,040 --> 01:21:54,240
this request,

4864
01:21:54,860 --> 01:21:55,800
as well as the degree

4865
01:21:55,800 --> 01:21:57,180
of intimacy subsisting

4866
01:21:57,180 --> 01:21:58,380
between the parties.

4867
01:22:00,020 --> 01:22:01,080
By all means.

4868
01:22:01,080 --> 01:22:01,940
Cried Bingley.

4869
01:22:01,940 --> 01:22:02,360
Let us hear

4870
01:22:02,360 --> 01:22:03,180
all the particulars,

4871
01:22:03,180 --> 01:22:03,740
not forgetting

4872
01:22:03,740 --> 01:22:04,460
their comparative

4873
01:22:04,460 --> 01:22:05,660
height and size.

4874
01:22:06,200 --> 01:22:06,620
For that will

4875
01:22:06,620 --> 01:22:07,140
have more weight

4876
01:22:07,140 --> 01:22:07,800
in the argument,

4877
01:22:07,800 --> 01:22:08,420
Miss Bennet,

4878
01:22:08,420 --> 01:22:08,760
than you

4879
01:22:08,760 --> 01:22:09,960
may be aware of.

4880
01:22:09,980 --> 01:22:10,940
I assure you that

4881
01:22:10,940 --> 01:22:12,000
if Darcy were not such

4882
01:22:12,000 --> 01:22:12,600
a great tool

4883
01:22:12,600 --> 01:22:13,500
fellow in comparison

4884
01:22:13,500 --> 01:22:14,160
with myself,

4885
01:22:14,160 --> 01:22:14,880
I should not pay him

4886
01:22:14,880 --> 01:22:16,100
half so much deference.

4887
01:22:18,180 --> 01:22:19,080
I declare

4888
01:22:19,080 --> 01:22:19,820
I do not know

4889
01:22:19,820 --> 01:22:20,820
a more awful object

4890
01:22:20,820 --> 01:22:21,360
than Darcy

4891
01:22:21,360 --> 01:22:22,320
on particular occasions

4892
01:22:22,320 --> 01:22:23,520
and in particular places

4893
01:22:24,860 --> 01:22:25,560
at his own house

4894
01:22:25,560 --> 01:22:26,640
especially.

4895
01:22:26,640 --> 01:22:27,780
And on a Sunday evening

4896
01:22:27,780 --> 01:22:28,160
when he has

4897
01:22:28,160 --> 01:22:29,360
nothing to do.

4898
01:22:29,780 --> 01:22:30,120
Mr.

4899
01:22:30,120 --> 01:22:31,320
Darcy smiled.

4900
01:22:31,320 --> 01:22:31,940
But Elizabeth

4901
01:22:31,940 --> 01:22:32,300
thought she

4902
01:22:32,300 --> 01:22:32,880
could perceive

4903
01:22:32,880 --> 01:22:33,200
that he was

4904
01:22:33,200 --> 01:22:34,340
rather offended

4905
01:22:34,340 --> 01:22:35,000
and therefore

4906
01:22:35,000 --> 01:22:36,200
checked her laugh.

4907
01:22:36,560 --> 01:22:37,280
Miss Bingley

4908
01:22:37,280 --> 01:22:38,300
warmly resented the.

4909
01:22:38,300 --> 01:22:38,900
Indignity.

4910
01:22:38,900 --> 01:22:39,800
He had received

4911
01:22:39,800 --> 01:22:41,000
and an expense relation

4912
01:22:41,000 --> 01:22:41,720
with her brother for

4913
01:22:41,720 --> 01:22:43,100
talking such nonsense.

4914
01:22:44,180 --> 01:22:44,760
I see your

4915
01:22:44,760 --> 01:22:45,960
design, Bingley.

4916
01:22:46,140 --> 01:22:47,280
Said his friend.

4917
01:22:47,280 --> 01:22:48,540
You dislike an argument

4918
01:22:48,540 --> 01:22:48,980
and want to

4919
01:22:48,980 --> 01:22:50,180
silence this?

4920
01:22:50,580 --> 01:22:51,780
Perhaps I do.

4921
01:22:52,040 --> 01:22:52,760
Arguments are too

4922
01:22:52,760 --> 01:22:53,960
much like disputes.

4923
01:22:54,120 --> 01:22:54,920
If you and Miss Bennet

4924
01:22:54,920 --> 01:22:55,760
will defer yours

4925
01:22:55,760 --> 01:22:56,100
till I am

4926
01:22:56,100 --> 01:22:56,720
out of the room,

4927
01:22:56,720 --> 01:22:57,020
I shall be

4928
01:22:57,020 --> 01:22:58,040
very thankful.

4929
01:22:58,040 --> 01:22:59,000
And then you may say

4930
01:22:59,000 --> 01:23:00,200
whatever you like of me.

4931
01:23:01,380 --> 01:23:02,580
What do you ask?

4932
01:23:02,640 --> 01:23:03,620
Said Elizabeth.

4933
01:23:03,620 --> 01:23:04,580
Is no sacrifice

4934
01:23:04,580 --> 01:23:05,600
on my side.

4935
01:23:05,600 --> 01:23:06,080
And Mr.

4936
01:23:06,080 --> 01:23:07,220
Darcy had much better

4937
01:23:07,220 --> 01:23:08,420
finish his letter.

4938
01:23:09,140 --> 01:23:09,480
Mr.

4939
01:23:09,480 --> 01:23:10,700
Darcy took her advice.

4940
01:23:10,980 --> 01:23:11,700
And did.

4941
01:23:11,700 --> 01:23:12,900
Finish his letter.

4942
01:23:13,380 --> 01:23:14,240
When that business

4943
01:23:14,240 --> 01:23:14,760
was over,

4944
01:23:14,760 --> 01:23:15,600
he applied to Ms..

4945
01:23:15,600 --> 01:23:16,800
Bingley and Elizabeth

4946
01:23:16,800 --> 01:23:17,460
an indulgence

4947
01:23:17,460 --> 01:23:18,660
of some music.

4948
01:23:18,720 --> 01:23:19,040
Ms..

4949
01:23:19,040 --> 01:23:19,700
Bingley moved

4950
01:23:19,700 --> 01:23:20,540
with some alacrity

4951
01:23:20,540 --> 01:23:21,740
to the pianoforte,

4952
01:23:21,860 --> 01:23:22,400
and after a

4953
01:23:22,400 --> 01:23:23,340
polite request

4954
01:23:23,340 --> 01:23:23,940
that Elizabeth

4955
01:23:23,940 --> 01:23:24,840
would lead the way,

4956
01:23:24,840 --> 01:23:25,680
which the other asked

4957
01:23:25,680 --> 01:23:26,640
politely and more

4958
01:23:26,640 --> 01:23:27,840
earnestly negative,

4959
01:23:27,860 --> 01:23:29,060
she seated herself.

4960
01:23:29,600 --> 01:23:29,940
Mrs.

4961
01:23:29,940 --> 01:23:30,300
Hurst

4962
01:23:30,300 --> 01:23:31,500
sang with her sister,

4963
01:23:31,620 --> 01:23:32,240
and while they were

4964
01:23:32,240 --> 01:23:33,780
thus employed, Elizabeth

4965
01:23:33,780 --> 01:23:35,060
could not help observing

4966
01:23:35,060 --> 01:23:35,660
as she turned.

4967
01:23:35,660 --> 01:23:36,900
Over music books that

4968
01:23:36,900 --> 01:23:38,100
lay on the instrument.

4969
01:23:38,180 --> 01:23:39,180
How frequently Mr.

4970
01:23:39,180 --> 01:23:39,620
Darcy's

4971
01:23:39,620 --> 01:23:40,980
eyes were fixed on her.

4972
01:23:41,360 --> 01:23:42,200
She hardly knew

4973
01:23:42,200 --> 01:23:42,960
how to suppose that

4974
01:23:42,960 --> 01:23:43,800
she could be an object

4975
01:23:43,800 --> 01:23:44,540
of admiration

4976
01:23:44,540 --> 01:23:45,080
to so great a.

4977
01:23:45,080 --> 01:23:45,900
Man,

4978
01:23:45,900 --> 01:23:46,680
and yet that he should.

4979
01:23:46,680 --> 01:23:47,240
Look at her

4980
01:23:47,240 --> 01:23:48,120
because he disliked

4981
01:23:48,120 --> 01:23:48,600
her was

4982
01:23:48,600 --> 01:23:49,800
still more strange.

4983
01:23:50,040 --> 01:23:51,120
She could only imagine,

4984
01:23:51,120 --> 01:23:51,980
however, at last,

4985
01:23:51,980 --> 01:23:52,440
that she drew

4986
01:23:52,440 --> 01:23:53,240
his notice.

4987
01:23:53,240 --> 01:23:53,780
Because there was

4988
01:23:53,780 --> 01:23:54,800
something more wrong.

4989
01:23:54,800 --> 01:23:55,760
And reprehensible

4990
01:23:55,760 --> 01:23:56,280
according to

4991
01:23:56,280 --> 01:23:57,480
his ideas of right,

4992
01:23:57,560 --> 01:23:58,640
than in any other person

4993
01:23:58,640 --> 01:23:59,700
present.

4994
01:23:59,700 --> 01:24:00,740
The supposition did not

4995
01:24:00,740 --> 01:24:01,560
pain her.

4996
01:24:01,560 --> 01:24:02,300
She liked him

4997
01:24:02,300 --> 01:24:02,940
to little to

4998
01:24:02,940 --> 01:24:03,380
care for

4999
01:24:03,380 --> 01:24:04,320
his approbation.

5000
01:24:05,280 --> 01:24:06,120
After Playing some

5001
01:24:06,120 --> 01:24:07,580
Italian songs, Ms..

5002
01:24:07,580 --> 01:24:08,880
Bingley varied the charm

5003
01:24:08,880 --> 01:24:10,380
by a lively Scotch air.

5004
01:24:10,640 --> 01:24:11,100
And soon.

5005
01:24:11,100 --> 01:24:11,940
Afterward, Mr.

5006
01:24:11,940 --> 01:24:13,200
Darcy, drawing near,

5007
01:24:13,200 --> 01:24:14,400
Elizabeth, said to her.

5008
01:24:15,740 --> 01:24:15,960
Do you

5009
01:24:15,960 --> 01:24:16,320
not feel

5010
01:24:16,320 --> 01:24:17,240
a great inclination,

5011
01:24:17,240 --> 01:24:18,620
Miss Bennet, to see such

5012
01:24:18,620 --> 01:24:19,320
an opportunity

5013
01:24:19,320 --> 01:24:19,860
of dancing?

5014
01:24:19,860 --> 01:24:21,060
A real.

5015
01:24:21,240 --> 01:24:22,040
She smiled,

5016
01:24:22,040 --> 01:24:23,240
but made no answer.

5017
01:24:23,460 --> 01:24:24,600
He repeated the question

5018
01:24:24,600 --> 01:24:25,460
with some surprise

5019
01:24:25,460 --> 01:24:26,660
at her silence.

5020
01:24:26,940 --> 01:24:27,740
Oh.

5021
01:24:27,740 --> 01:24:28,640
Said she.

5022
01:24:28,640 --> 01:24:29,840
I heard you before,

5023
01:24:29,940 --> 01:24:30,480
but I could not

5024
01:24:30,480 --> 01:24:31,340
immediately determined

5025
01:24:31,340 --> 01:24:32,540
what to say in reply.

5026
01:24:32,840 --> 01:24:33,540
You wanted me.

5027
01:24:33,540 --> 01:24:35,040
I know to say yes.

5028
01:24:35,180 --> 01:24:35,840
That you might have

5029
01:24:35,840 --> 01:24:36,260
the pleasure

5030
01:24:36,260 --> 01:24:37,760
of despising my taste,

5031
01:24:38,220 --> 01:24:39,500
but I always delight

5032
01:24:39,500 --> 01:24:40,100
in overthrowing

5033
01:24:40,100 --> 01:24:41,300
those kind of schemes

5034
01:24:41,400 --> 01:24:42,020
and cheating a.

5035
01:24:42,020 --> 01:24:42,380
Person

5036
01:24:42,380 --> 01:24:43,340
of that premeditated.

5037
01:24:43,340 --> 01:24:44,540
Contempt.

5038
01:24:44,580 --> 01:24:45,320
I have therefore

5039
01:24:45,320 --> 01:24:46,140
made up my mind

5040
01:24:46,140 --> 01:24:47,000
to tell you

5041
01:24:47,000 --> 01:24:47,540
that I do not

5042
01:24:47,540 --> 01:24:48,060
want to dance

5043
01:24:48,060 --> 01:24:49,200
with me at all.

5044
01:24:49,200 --> 01:24:50,060
And now

5045
01:24:50,060 --> 01:24:51,960
despise me if you dare.

5046
01:24:53,060 --> 01:24:53,580
Indeed, I

5047
01:24:53,580 --> 01:24:54,780
do not dare.

5048
01:24:55,500 --> 01:24:56,640
Elizabeth, having rather

5049
01:24:56,640 --> 01:24:57,840
expected to affront him.

5050
01:24:57,980 --> 01:24:58,980
Was amazed at his.

5051
01:24:58,980 --> 01:24:59,960
Gallantry.

5052
01:24:59,960 --> 01:25:00,900
But there was a mixture

5053
01:25:00,900 --> 01:25:01,640
of sweetness

5054
01:25:01,640 --> 01:25:02,300
and archness

5055
01:25:02,300 --> 01:25:02,840
in her manner,

5056
01:25:02,840 --> 01:25:03,740
which made it difficult

5057
01:25:03,740 --> 01:25:04,020
for her

5058
01:25:04,020 --> 01:25:05,220
to affront anybody.

5059
01:25:05,420 --> 01:25:06,060
Hence, Darcy

5060
01:25:06,060 --> 01:25:06,560
had never been

5061
01:25:06,560 --> 01:25:07,200
so bewitched.

5062
01:25:07,200 --> 01:25:07,920
By any woman

5063
01:25:07,920 --> 01:25:09,120
as he was by her.

5064
01:25:09,440 --> 01:25:10,760
He really believed that

5065
01:25:10,760 --> 01:25:11,340
if it were not

5066
01:25:11,340 --> 01:25:12,300
for the inferiority

5067
01:25:12,300 --> 01:25:13,320
of her connections,

5068
01:25:13,320 --> 01:25:13,880
he should be

5069
01:25:13,880 --> 01:25:15,080
in some danger.

5070
01:25:15,800 --> 01:25:16,460
Miss Bingley

5071
01:25:16,460 --> 01:25:17,760
saw or suspected

5072
01:25:17,760 --> 01:25:18,860
enough to be jealous

5073
01:25:18,860 --> 01:25:20,160
and her great anxiety

5074
01:25:20,160 --> 01:25:20,880
for the recovery

5075
01:25:20,880 --> 01:25:22,160
of her dear friend Jane

5076
01:25:22,340 --> 01:25:23,480
received some assistance

5077
01:25:23,480 --> 01:25:24,200
from her desire

5078
01:25:24,200 --> 01:25:24,600
of getting

5079
01:25:24,600 --> 01:25:25,800
rid of Elizabeth.

5080
01:25:26,160 --> 01:25:27,140
She often tried

5081
01:25:27,140 --> 01:25:27,980
to provoke Darcy

5082
01:25:27,980 --> 01:25:29,220
into disliking her guest

5083
01:25:29,420 --> 01:25:30,000
by talking

5084
01:25:30,000 --> 01:25:30,240
of their

5085
01:25:30,240 --> 01:25:31,320
supposed marriage

5086
01:25:31,320 --> 01:25:31,920
and planning

5087
01:25:31,920 --> 01:25:32,640
his happiness

5088
01:25:32,640 --> 01:25:33,840
in such an alliance.

5089
01:25:34,440 --> 01:25:35,640
No, I hope.

5090
01:25:35,700 --> 01:25:36,360
Said she,

5091
01:25:36,360 --> 01:25:36,680
as they were

5092
01:25:36,680 --> 01:25:37,440
walking together

5093
01:25:37,440 --> 01:25:38,000
in the strawberry.

5094
01:25:38,000 --> 01:25:39,200
The next day

5095
01:25:39,440 --> 01:25:39,920
you will give

5096
01:25:39,920 --> 01:25:40,940
your mother in law

5097
01:25:40,940 --> 01:25:41,940
a few hints

5098
01:25:41,940 --> 01:25:43,040
when this desirable

5099
01:25:43,040 --> 01:25:44,240
event place.

5100
01:25:44,300 --> 01:25:45,260
As to the advantage

5101
01:25:45,260 --> 01:25:46,460
of holding her tongue

5102
01:25:46,920 --> 01:25:47,720
hand if you can

5103
01:25:47,720 --> 01:25:48,960
composite to cure

5104
01:25:48,980 --> 01:25:49,500
the younger

5105
01:25:49,500 --> 01:25:50,400
girls of running

5106
01:25:50,400 --> 01:25:51,600
after officers.

5107
01:25:51,780 --> 01:25:53,400
And if I may mention

5108
01:25:53,400 --> 01:25:54,200
so delicate

5109
01:25:54,200 --> 01:25:55,560
a subject endeavor

5110
01:25:55,560 --> 01:25:56,180
to check that

5111
01:25:56,180 --> 01:25:57,260
little something

5112
01:25:57,260 --> 01:25:58,880
bordering on conceit

5113
01:25:58,880 --> 01:26:00,140
and impertinence which

5114
01:26:00,140 --> 01:26:01,560
your lady possesses.

5115
01:26:03,260 --> 01:26:03,600
Have you

5116
01:26:03,600 --> 01:26:04,160
anything else to

5117
01:26:04,160 --> 01:26:04,620
propose for

5118
01:26:04,620 --> 01:26:05,840
my domestic Felicity?

5119
01:26:07,100 --> 01:26:08,300
Oh, yes.

5120
01:26:08,460 --> 01:26:09,680
Do you let the portraits

5121
01:26:09,680 --> 01:26:10,260
of your uncle

5122
01:26:10,260 --> 01:26:11,280
and Aunt Philips

5123
01:26:11,280 --> 01:26:11,820
be placed

5124
01:26:11,820 --> 01:26:12,720
in the gallery?

5125
01:26:12,720 --> 01:26:13,680
Pemberley.

5126
01:26:13,680 --> 01:26:14,340
Put them next

5127
01:26:14,340 --> 01:26:15,180
to your great uncle,

5128
01:26:15,180 --> 01:26:16,260
The judge.

5129
01:26:16,260 --> 01:26:16,740
They are

5130
01:26:16,740 --> 01:26:17,640
in the same profession,

5131
01:26:17,640 --> 01:26:18,140
you know,

5132
01:26:18,140 --> 01:26:19,640
only in different lines.

5133
01:26:20,220 --> 01:26:21,000
As if you were

5134
01:26:21,000 --> 01:26:22,200
Elizabeth's picture.

5135
01:26:22,200 --> 01:26:23,660
You not have it taken

5136
01:26:23,880 --> 01:26:24,320
for what?

5137
01:26:24,320 --> 01:26:25,680
Painter could do justice

5138
01:26:25,680 --> 01:26:27,500
to those beautiful eyes.

5139
01:26:29,000 --> 01:26:29,760
It would not be easy,

5140
01:26:29,760 --> 01:26:30,200
indeed, to

5141
01:26:30,200 --> 01:26:31,400
catch their expression.

5142
01:26:31,580 --> 01:26:32,180
But their color

5143
01:26:32,180 --> 01:26:32,660
and shape

5144
01:26:32,660 --> 01:26:33,420
and the eyelashes

5145
01:26:33,420 --> 01:26:34,620
so remarkably fine

5146
01:26:34,620 --> 01:26:35,820
might be copied.

5147
01:26:37,140 --> 01:26:38,100
At that moment,

5148
01:26:38,100 --> 01:26:38,540
they were met

5149
01:26:38,540 --> 01:26:39,480
from another walk

5150
01:26:39,480 --> 01:26:39,960
by Mrs.

5151
01:26:39,960 --> 01:26:40,380
Hurst

5152
01:26:40,380 --> 01:26:41,580
and Elizabeth herself.

5153
01:26:42,520 --> 01:26:43,400
No, I did not know that

5154
01:26:43,400 --> 01:26:44,600
you intended to walk.

5155
01:26:44,840 --> 01:26:45,660
Said Miss Bingley,

5156
01:26:45,660 --> 01:26:47,060
in some confusion, lest

5157
01:26:47,060 --> 01:26:48,260
they'd been overheard.

5158
01:26:48,660 --> 01:26:49,520
You used us

5159
01:26:49,520 --> 01:26:50,760
abominably, ill.

5160
01:26:51,200 --> 01:26:51,860
Answered Mrs.

5161
01:26:51,860 --> 01:26:52,520
Hurst.

5162
01:26:52,520 --> 01:26:53,180
Running away

5163
01:26:53,180 --> 01:26:54,020
without telling us that

5164
01:26:54,020 --> 01:26:54,860
you were coming out.

5165
01:26:55,820 --> 01:26:56,720
Then taking the

5166
01:26:56,720 --> 01:26:57,840
disengaged arm of Mr.

5167
01:26:57,840 --> 01:26:58,520
Darcy.

5168
01:26:58,520 --> 01:26:59,520
She left Elizabeth

5169
01:26:59,520 --> 01:27:00,740
to walk by herself.

5170
01:27:01,100 --> 01:27:01,640
The path

5171
01:27:01,640 --> 01:27:02,840
just admitted three.

5172
01:27:03,140 --> 01:27:03,480
Mr.

5173
01:27:03,480 --> 01:27:04,100
Darcy fell

5174
01:27:04,100 --> 01:27:04,860
to their rudeness

5175
01:27:04,860 --> 01:27:06,060
and immediately said.

5176
01:27:06,320 --> 01:27:07,280
This walk is not wide

5177
01:27:07,280 --> 01:27:08,480
enough for our party.

5178
01:27:08,700 --> 01:27:09,240
We had better

5179
01:27:09,240 --> 01:27:10,440
go into the avenue.

5180
01:27:10,760 --> 01:27:11,700
But Elizabeth,

5181
01:27:11,700 --> 01:27:12,320
who had not

5182
01:27:12,320 --> 01:27:13,320
the least inclination

5183
01:27:13,320 --> 01:27:14,280
to remain with them,

5184
01:27:14,280 --> 01:27:15,480
laughingly answered.

5185
01:27:15,960 --> 01:27:16,920
No, no.

5186
01:27:16,920 --> 01:27:18,120
Stay where you are.

5187
01:27:18,120 --> 01:27:18,540
You are

5188
01:27:18,540 --> 01:27:19,520
charmingly grouped

5189
01:27:19,520 --> 01:27:20,040
and appear

5190
01:27:20,040 --> 01:27:21,360
to one common advantage.

5191
01:27:21,620 --> 01:27:22,460
The picturesque

5192
01:27:22,460 --> 01:27:23,280
would be spoiled

5193
01:27:23,280 --> 01:27:23,760
by admitting

5194
01:27:23,760 --> 01:27:25,140
a fourth goodbye.

5195
01:27:25,820 --> 01:27:26,600
She then ran

5196
01:27:26,600 --> 01:27:28,160
gaily off, rejoicing

5197
01:27:28,160 --> 01:27:29,360
as she rambled about.

5198
01:27:29,360 --> 01:27:29,840
In the hope

5199
01:27:29,840 --> 01:27:30,540
of being at home.

5200
01:27:30,540 --> 01:27:31,740
Again in a day or two.

5201
01:27:31,980 --> 01:27:32,880
Jane was already

5202
01:27:32,880 --> 01:27:33,660
so much recovered

5203
01:27:33,660 --> 01:27:34,280
as to intend

5204
01:27:34,280 --> 01:27:35,000
leaving her room

5205
01:27:35,000 --> 01:27:35,960
for a couple of hours

5206
01:27:35,960 --> 01:27:37,160
that evening.

5207
01:27:39,300 --> 01:27:40,220
Chapter 11.

5208
01:27:41,580 --> 01:27:42,620
When the ladies removed

5209
01:27:42,620 --> 01:27:43,800
after dinner, Elizabeth

5210
01:27:43,800 --> 01:27:45,000
ran up to her sister

5211
01:27:45,060 --> 01:27:45,720
and seeing her

5212
01:27:45,720 --> 01:27:46,920
well guarded from cold,

5213
01:27:47,100 --> 01:27:47,700
attended her

5214
01:27:47,700 --> 01:27:48,720
into the drawing room

5215
01:27:48,720 --> 01:27:49,200
where she was

5216
01:27:49,200 --> 01:27:49,880
welcomed by her

5217
01:27:49,880 --> 01:27:50,480
two friends

5218
01:27:50,480 --> 01:27:51,480
with many professions

5219
01:27:51,480 --> 01:27:52,440
of pleasure.

5220
01:27:52,440 --> 01:27:53,100
And Elizabeth

5221
01:27:53,100 --> 01:27:53,820
had never seen them

5222
01:27:53,820 --> 01:27:54,500
so agreeable

5223
01:27:54,500 --> 01:27:54,980
as they were

5224
01:27:54,980 --> 01:27:55,740
during the hour

5225
01:27:55,740 --> 01:27:56,600
which passed before

5226
01:27:56,600 --> 01:27:57,800
the gentleman appeared.

5227
01:27:57,980 --> 01:27:58,640
Their powers

5228
01:27:58,640 --> 01:27:59,480
of conversation

5229
01:27:59,480 --> 01:28:00,620
were considerable.

5230
01:28:00,620 --> 01:28:01,500
They could describe

5231
01:28:01,500 --> 01:28:02,120
in entertainment

5232
01:28:02,120 --> 01:28:03,540
with accuracy, relate

5233
01:28:03,540 --> 01:28:04,740
an anecdote with humor

5234
01:28:04,920 --> 01:28:05,540
and laugh

5235
01:28:05,540 --> 01:28:06,420
at their acquaintance

5236
01:28:06,420 --> 01:28:07,620
with spirit.

5237
01:28:07,740 --> 01:28:08,220
But when the

5238
01:28:08,220 --> 01:28:09,300
gentleman entered,

5239
01:28:09,300 --> 01:28:10,320
Jane was no longer

5240
01:28:10,320 --> 01:28:11,520
the first object.

5241
01:28:11,600 --> 01:28:12,360
Miss Bailey's

5242
01:28:12,360 --> 01:28:13,260
eyes were instantly

5243
01:28:13,260 --> 01:28:14,540
turned toward Darcy,

5244
01:28:14,760 --> 01:28:15,200
and she had

5245
01:28:15,200 --> 01:28:16,040
something to say to him

5246
01:28:16,040 --> 01:28:17,000
before he had advanced

5247
01:28:17,000 --> 01:28:18,180
many steps.

5248
01:28:18,180 --> 01:28:19,080
He addressed himself

5249
01:28:19,080 --> 01:28:19,880
to Miss Bennett

5250
01:28:19,880 --> 01:28:20,580
with a polite

5251
01:28:20,580 --> 01:28:21,780
congratulation.

5252
01:28:21,860 --> 01:28:22,160
Mr.

5253
01:28:22,160 --> 01:28:22,560
Hurst

5254
01:28:22,560 --> 01:28:23,240
also made her

5255
01:28:23,240 --> 01:28:24,240
a slight bow

5256
01:28:24,240 --> 01:28:24,720
and said he.

5257
01:28:24,720 --> 01:28:25,940
Was very glad.

5258
01:28:26,280 --> 01:28:27,360
But a few and.

5259
01:28:27,360 --> 01:28:28,040
Warmth remained

5260
01:28:28,040 --> 01:28:29,420
for Bingley salutation.

5261
01:28:29,760 --> 01:28:30,800
He was full of.

5262
01:28:30,800 --> 01:28:32,000
Joy and attention.

5263
01:28:32,360 --> 01:28:33,300
The first half hour

5264
01:28:33,300 --> 01:28:33,720
was spent

5265
01:28:33,720 --> 01:28:34,320
in piling up

5266
01:28:34,320 --> 01:28:35,340
the fire, lest

5267
01:28:35,340 --> 01:28:36,140
she should suffer

5268
01:28:36,140 --> 01:28:37,340
from the change of room.

5269
01:28:37,440 --> 01:28:38,420
And she removed at his.

5270
01:28:38,420 --> 01:28:39,480
Desire to the other side

5271
01:28:39,480 --> 01:28:40,440
of the fireplace

5272
01:28:40,440 --> 01:28:40,980
that she might

5273
01:28:40,980 --> 01:28:41,520
be further

5274
01:28:41,520 --> 01:28:42,560
from the door.

5275
01:28:42,560 --> 01:28:44,100
He then sat down by her

5276
01:28:44,300 --> 01:28:45,320
and talked scarcely

5277
01:28:45,320 --> 01:28:46,520
to anyone else.

5278
01:28:46,560 --> 01:28:47,660
Elizabeth, at work

5279
01:28:47,660 --> 01:28:48,860
in the opposite corner,

5280
01:28:48,860 --> 01:28:49,580
saw it all

5281
01:28:49,580 --> 01:28:50,780
with great delight.

5282
01:28:51,560 --> 01:28:52,940
When he was over, Mr.

5283
01:28:52,940 --> 01:28:53,580
Hurst reminded

5284
01:28:53,580 --> 01:28:54,120
his sister in

5285
01:28:54,120 --> 01:28:55,320
law of the card table,

5286
01:28:55,380 --> 01:28:56,480
but in vain

5287
01:28:56,480 --> 01:28:57,240
she had obtained

5288
01:28:57,240 --> 01:28:58,140
private intelligence

5289
01:28:58,140 --> 01:28:58,520
that Mr.

5290
01:28:58,520 --> 01:28:59,180
Darcy did not

5291
01:28:59,180 --> 01:29:00,180
wish for cards.

5292
01:29:00,180 --> 01:29:00,600
Had Mr.

5293
01:29:00,600 --> 01:29:01,380
Hurst soon

5294
01:29:01,380 --> 01:29:02,400
found even his open

5295
01:29:02,400 --> 01:29:03,600
petition rejected.

5296
01:29:03,900 --> 01:29:04,800
She assured him that

5297
01:29:04,800 --> 01:29:06,020
no one intended to play,

5298
01:29:06,260 --> 01:29:06,980
and the silence

5299
01:29:06,980 --> 01:29:07,740
of the whole party

5300
01:29:07,740 --> 01:29:08,400
on the subject

5301
01:29:08,400 --> 01:29:09,600
seemed to justify her.

5302
01:29:10,020 --> 01:29:10,340
Mr.

5303
01:29:10,340 --> 01:29:10,700
Hurst

5304
01:29:10,700 --> 01:29:11,220
had therefore

5305
01:29:11,220 --> 01:29:12,140
nothing to do

5306
01:29:12,140 --> 01:29:13,080
but to stretch himself

5307
01:29:13,080 --> 01:29:13,440
on one of the.

5308
01:29:13,440 --> 01:29:14,760
Sofas and go to sleep.

5309
01:29:15,320 --> 01:29:16,520
Darcy took up a book.

5310
01:29:16,760 --> 01:29:17,400
Miss Bingley

5311
01:29:17,400 --> 01:29:18,300
did the same.

5312
01:29:18,300 --> 01:29:18,780
Had Mrs.

5313
01:29:18,780 --> 01:29:19,280
Hurst

5314
01:29:19,280 --> 01:29:20,400
principally occupied

5315
01:29:20,400 --> 01:29:20,840
in playing

5316
01:29:20,840 --> 01:29:21,540
with her bracelets

5317
01:29:21,540 --> 01:29:22,980
and rings, joined now

5318
01:29:22,980 --> 01:29:23,280
and then

5319
01:29:23,280 --> 01:29:23,460
in her

5320
01:29:23,460 --> 01:29:24,480
brother's conversation

5321
01:29:24,480 --> 01:29:25,680
with Miss Bennet.

5322
01:29:25,980 --> 01:29:26,600
Miss Begley's

5323
01:29:26,600 --> 01:29:27,180
attention was.

5324
01:29:27,180 --> 01:29:28,020
Quite as engaged

5325
01:29:28,020 --> 01:29:28,760
in watching Mr.

5326
01:29:28,760 --> 01:29:29,580
Darcy's progress

5327
01:29:29,580 --> 01:29:30,480
through his book

5328
01:29:30,480 --> 01:29:31,680
as in reading her own.

5329
01:29:31,860 --> 01:29:32,900
And she was perpetually

5330
01:29:32,900 --> 01:29:33,180
either

5331
01:29:33,180 --> 01:29:34,340
making some inquiry

5332
01:29:34,340 --> 01:29:35,660
or looking at his page.

5333
01:29:36,180 --> 01:29:37,040
She could not win.

5334
01:29:37,040 --> 01:29:37,740
Him, however, to

5335
01:29:37,740 --> 01:29:38,940
any conversation.

5336
01:29:39,000 --> 01:29:39,900
He merely answered

5337
01:29:39,900 --> 01:29:40,500
your question

5338
01:29:40,500 --> 01:29:41,700
and read on

5339
01:29:41,840 --> 01:29:42,600
at length,

5340
01:29:42,600 --> 01:29:42,900
quite

5341
01:29:42,900 --> 01:29:44,100
exhausted by the attempt

5342
01:29:44,100 --> 01:29:44,660
to be amused

5343
01:29:44,660 --> 01:29:45,120
with her own.

5344
01:29:45,120 --> 01:29:46,020
Book, which she had.

5345
01:29:46,020 --> 01:29:46,680
Only chosen

5346
01:29:46,680 --> 01:29:47,180
because it was the

5347
01:29:47,180 --> 01:29:48,380
second volume of his.

5348
01:29:48,720 --> 01:29:49,800
She gave a great yarn

5349
01:29:49,800 --> 01:29:51,000
and said.

5350
01:29:51,020 --> 01:29:52,040
How pleasant it is

5351
01:29:52,040 --> 01:29:52,380
to spend

5352
01:29:52,380 --> 01:29:53,580
an evening in this way.

5353
01:29:53,780 --> 01:29:54,920
I declare, After all,

5354
01:29:54,920 --> 01:29:55,920
there is no enjoyment

5355
01:29:55,920 --> 01:29:57,120
like reading.

5356
01:29:57,140 --> 01:29:58,320
How much sooner one.

5357
01:29:58,320 --> 01:29:59,360
Tears of anything than.

5358
01:29:59,360 --> 01:30:00,120
Of a book.

5359
01:30:00,120 --> 01:30:00,620
When I have

5360
01:30:00,620 --> 01:30:01,520
a house of my own,

5361
01:30:01,520 --> 01:30:02,400
I shall be miserable

5362
01:30:02,400 --> 01:30:03,000
if I have not an

5363
01:30:03,000 --> 01:30:04,200
excellent library.

5364
01:30:05,040 --> 01:30:06,300
No one made any reply.

5365
01:30:06,680 --> 01:30:07,820
She then yawned again.

5366
01:30:07,820 --> 01:30:08,480
Threw aside her.

5367
01:30:08,480 --> 01:30:09,060
Book.

5368
01:30:09,060 --> 01:30:10,040
And cast her eyes

5369
01:30:10,040 --> 01:30:11,000
round the room in quest

5370
01:30:11,000 --> 01:30:12,120
for some amusement.

5371
01:30:12,120 --> 01:30:13,020
When hearing her brother

5372
01:30:13,020 --> 01:30:13,880
mentioning a ball to,

5373
01:30:13,880 --> 01:30:14,700
Miss Bennet.

5374
01:30:14,700 --> 01:30:15,140
She turned

5375
01:30:15,140 --> 01:30:16,040
suddenly towards him

5376
01:30:16,040 --> 01:30:17,120
and said,

5377
01:30:17,120 --> 01:30:18,320
By the by Charles,

5378
01:30:18,480 --> 01:30:19,680
Are you very serious

5379
01:30:19,680 --> 01:30:20,700
in meditating a dance

5380
01:30:20,700 --> 01:30:21,900
at Netherfield?

5381
01:30:22,040 --> 01:30:22,940
I would advise you

5382
01:30:22,940 --> 01:30:24,140
before you determine it,

5383
01:30:24,360 --> 01:30:24,860
to consult

5384
01:30:24,860 --> 01:30:25,280
the wishes

5385
01:30:25,280 --> 01:30:26,480
of the present party.

5386
01:30:26,820 --> 01:30:28,160
I am much mistaken

5387
01:30:28,160 --> 01:30:28,640
if there are not

5388
01:30:28,640 --> 01:30:29,580
some among us to

5389
01:30:29,580 --> 01:30:30,020
whom a ball

5390
01:30:30,020 --> 01:30:30,660
would rather be a

5391
01:30:30,660 --> 01:30:31,460
punishment than

5392
01:30:31,460 --> 01:30:32,100
a pleasure.

5393
01:30:33,540 --> 01:30:34,740
If you mean Darcy.

5394
01:30:34,940 --> 01:30:36,140
Cried her brother.

5395
01:30:36,540 --> 01:30:37,400
He may go to bed

5396
01:30:37,400 --> 01:30:37,980
if he chooses

5397
01:30:37,980 --> 01:30:38,720
before it begins.

5398
01:30:38,720 --> 01:30:39,920
But as for the ball,

5399
01:30:40,200 --> 01:30:40,740
it is quite a

5400
01:30:40,740 --> 01:30:41,940
settled thing.

5401
01:30:42,440 --> 01:30:43,340
And as soon as

5402
01:30:43,340 --> 01:30:43,700
has made

5403
01:30:43,700 --> 01:30:44,420
white soup enough,

5404
01:30:44,420 --> 01:30:44,960
I shall send

5405
01:30:44,960 --> 01:30:46,160
round my cards.

5406
01:30:48,120 --> 01:30:49,280
I should like balls

5407
01:30:49,280 --> 01:30:50,600
infinitely better.

5408
01:30:50,960 --> 01:30:51,960
She replied.

5409
01:30:51,960 --> 01:30:53,120
If they were carried on

5410
01:30:53,120 --> 01:30:54,320
in a different manner.

5411
01:30:54,720 --> 01:30:55,560
But there is something

5412
01:30:55,560 --> 01:30:57,080
insufferably tedious,

5413
01:30:57,200 --> 01:30:58,140
the usual process

5414
01:30:58,140 --> 01:30:59,300
of such a meeting.

5415
01:30:59,300 --> 01:31:00,200
It would surely

5416
01:31:00,200 --> 01:31:01,220
be more rational

5417
01:31:01,220 --> 01:31:02,000
a conversation

5418
01:31:02,000 --> 01:31:03,100
instead of dancing.

5419
01:31:03,100 --> 01:31:03,680
Made the order

5420
01:31:03,680 --> 01:31:04,880
of the day.

5421
01:31:05,420 --> 01:31:06,360
Much more rational.

5422
01:31:06,360 --> 01:31:07,140
My dear Caroline,

5423
01:31:07,140 --> 01:31:08,340
I daresay.

5424
01:31:08,540 --> 01:31:09,420
But it would not be near

5425
01:31:09,420 --> 01:31:10,620
so much like a ball.

5426
01:31:11,900 --> 01:31:12,540
Miss Bingley

5427
01:31:12,540 --> 01:31:13,620
made no answer.

5428
01:31:13,620 --> 01:31:14,100
And soon.

5429
01:31:14,100 --> 01:31:14,580
Afterwards

5430
01:31:14,580 --> 01:31:15,120
she got up

5431
01:31:15,120 --> 01:31:15,540
and walked

5432
01:31:15,540 --> 01:31:16,640
about the room.

5433
01:31:16,640 --> 01:31:17,940
Her figure was elegant

5434
01:31:17,940 --> 01:31:19,140
and she walked well.

5435
01:31:19,340 --> 01:31:20,220
But Darcy,

5436
01:31:20,220 --> 01:31:21,020
at whom it was all.

5437
01:31:21,020 --> 01:31:21,960
Aimed. Was still.

5438
01:31:21,960 --> 01:31:23,300
In flexibly studious

5439
01:31:23,580 --> 01:31:24,480
in the desperation

5440
01:31:24,480 --> 01:31:25,320
of her feelings.

5441
01:31:25,320 --> 01:31:25,980
She resolved

5442
01:31:25,980 --> 01:31:27,180
on one effort more.

5443
01:31:27,180 --> 01:31:27,680
And turning

5444
01:31:27,680 --> 01:31:29,540
to Elizabeth, said Ms..

5445
01:31:29,540 --> 01:31:30,680
Eliza Bennet,

5446
01:31:30,680 --> 01:31:31,640
Let me persuade you

5447
01:31:31,640 --> 01:31:32,780
to follow my example

5448
01:31:32,780 --> 01:31:33,540
and to take a turn

5449
01:31:33,540 --> 01:31:34,580
about the room.

5450
01:31:34,580 --> 01:31:35,240
I assure you,

5451
01:31:35,240 --> 01:31:36,240
it is very refreshing

5452
01:31:36,240 --> 01:31:36,680
after sitting

5453
01:31:36,680 --> 01:31:38,040
so long in one attitude.

5454
01:31:39,000 --> 01:31:39,600
Elizabeth was

5455
01:31:39,600 --> 01:31:40,580
surprised, but

5456
01:31:40,580 --> 01:31:41,160
agreed to it

5457
01:31:41,160 --> 01:31:42,180
immediately.

5458
01:31:42,180 --> 01:31:43,380
Miss Bingley succeeded

5459
01:31:43,380 --> 01:31:44,360
no less than the real

5460
01:31:44,360 --> 01:31:45,560
object of her civility.

5461
01:31:45,720 --> 01:31:47,040
Mr. looked up.

5462
01:31:47,360 --> 01:31:48,420
He was as much a way

5463
01:31:48,420 --> 01:31:49,080
to the novelty

5464
01:31:49,080 --> 01:31:49,580
of attention

5465
01:31:49,580 --> 01:31:50,280
in that quarter

5466
01:31:50,280 --> 01:31:51,240
as Elizabeth herself

5467
01:31:51,240 --> 01:31:51,380
could.

5468
01:31:51,380 --> 01:31:52,740
Be, and unconsciously

5469
01:31:52,740 --> 01:31:53,940
closed his book.

5470
01:31:54,060 --> 01:31:54,780
He was directly.

5471
01:31:54,780 --> 01:31:55,580
Invited to join

5472
01:31:55,580 --> 01:31:56,400
their party,

5473
01:31:56,400 --> 01:31:57,600
but he declined it.

5474
01:31:57,680 --> 01:31:58,620
Observing that he could

5475
01:31:58,620 --> 01:32:00,080
imagine much too motives

5476
01:32:00,080 --> 01:32:00,720
for their choosing

5477
01:32:00,720 --> 01:32:01,260
to walk up

5478
01:32:01,260 --> 01:32:01,520
and down

5479
01:32:01,520 --> 01:32:02,540
the room together

5480
01:32:02,540 --> 01:32:03,180
with either

5481
01:32:03,180 --> 01:32:03,980
of which motives

5482
01:32:03,980 --> 01:32:04,500
his joining

5483
01:32:04,500 --> 01:32:05,700
them would interfere.

5484
01:32:06,140 --> 01:32:07,860
What could he mean?

5485
01:32:08,120 --> 01:32:09,440
She was dying to know

5486
01:32:09,440 --> 01:32:09,800
what could be

5487
01:32:09,800 --> 01:32:11,000
his meaning.

5488
01:32:11,240 --> 01:32:12,240
And asked Elizabeth

5489
01:32:12,240 --> 01:32:13,020
whether she could at all

5490
01:32:13,020 --> 01:32:14,220
understand him.

5491
01:32:14,700 --> 01:32:15,860
Not at all.

5492
01:32:15,860 --> 01:32:17,060
Was her answer.

5493
01:32:17,180 --> 01:32:18,320
But to depend upon it.

5494
01:32:18,320 --> 01:32:19,560
He means to be severe

5495
01:32:19,560 --> 01:32:20,240
on us,

5496
01:32:20,240 --> 01:32:21,120
and our surest way

5497
01:32:21,120 --> 01:32:21,780
of disappointing

5498
01:32:21,780 --> 01:32:22,620
him will be to ask

5499
01:32:22,620 --> 01:32:23,820
nothing about it.

5500
01:32:24,480 --> 01:32:25,140
Miss Bingley,

5501
01:32:25,140 --> 01:32:26,180
however was incapable

5502
01:32:26,180 --> 01:32:27,000
of disappointing Mr.

5503
01:32:27,000 --> 01:32:28,200
Darcy in anything

5504
01:32:28,320 --> 01:32:29,100
and persevered,

5505
01:32:29,100 --> 01:32:29,580
therefore in

5506
01:32:29,580 --> 01:32:30,780
requiring an explanation

5507
01:32:30,780 --> 01:32:31,700
of his two motives.

5508
01:32:33,000 --> 01:32:33,500
I have

5509
01:32:33,500 --> 01:32:33,780
not the

5510
01:32:33,780 --> 01:32:34,620
smallest objection

5511
01:32:34,620 --> 01:32:35,820
to explaining them.

5512
01:32:36,060 --> 01:32:36,800
Said he,

5513
01:32:36,800 --> 01:32:37,260
as soon as

5514
01:32:37,260 --> 01:32:37,800
she allowed him

5515
01:32:37,800 --> 01:32:38,720
to speak.

5516
01:32:38,720 --> 01:32:39,680
You either choose this

5517
01:32:39,680 --> 01:32:40,160
method of

5518
01:32:40,160 --> 01:32:41,060
passing the evening

5519
01:32:41,060 --> 01:32:41,660
because you are

5520
01:32:41,660 --> 01:32:41,960
in each

5521
01:32:41,960 --> 01:32:42,900
other's confidence

5522
01:32:42,900 --> 01:32:43,220
and have

5523
01:32:43,220 --> 01:32:43,980
secret affairs

5524
01:32:43,980 --> 01:32:45,180
to discuss,

5525
01:32:45,920 --> 01:32:46,560
or because you

5526
01:32:46,560 --> 01:32:47,160
are conscious

5527
01:32:47,160 --> 01:32:47,880
that your figures

5528
01:32:47,880 --> 01:32:48,140
appear

5529
01:32:48,140 --> 01:32:48,380
to the

5530
01:32:48,380 --> 01:32:49,460
greatest advantage

5531
01:32:49,460 --> 01:32:50,520
in walking.

5532
01:32:50,520 --> 01:32:51,720
If the first

5533
01:32:51,860 --> 01:32:52,340
I should be

5534
01:32:52,340 --> 01:32:53,540
completely in your way

5535
01:32:54,060 --> 01:32:55,160
and if the second,

5536
01:32:55,160 --> 01:32:55,860
I can admire

5537
01:32:55,860 --> 01:32:57,080
you much better as I sit

5538
01:32:57,080 --> 01:32:58,280
by the fire.

5539
01:33:00,000 --> 01:33:01,200
Shocking.

5540
01:33:01,520 --> 01:33:02,720
Cried Miss Bingley.

5541
01:33:02,900 --> 01:33:04,560
I never heard anything

5542
01:33:04,560 --> 01:33:05,760
so abominable.

5543
01:33:05,780 --> 01:33:07,080
How shall we punish him

5544
01:33:07,080 --> 01:33:08,280
for such a speech?

5545
01:33:09,020 --> 01:33:10,220
Nothing so easy

5546
01:33:10,220 --> 01:33:10,700
if you have.

5547
01:33:10,700 --> 01:33:11,900
But the inclination,

5548
01:33:12,120 --> 01:33:13,280
said Elizabeth.

5549
01:33:13,280 --> 01:33:14,280
We can all plague

5550
01:33:14,280 --> 01:33:15,480
and punish one another.

5551
01:33:15,780 --> 01:33:16,740
Tease him,

5552
01:33:16,740 --> 01:33:17,940
laugh at him.

5553
01:33:17,960 --> 01:33:19,140
Intimate as you are.

5554
01:33:19,140 --> 01:33:20,100
You must know how it is

5555
01:33:20,100 --> 01:33:21,300
to be done.

5556
01:33:21,440 --> 01:33:22,580
But upon my honor,

5557
01:33:22,580 --> 01:33:23,780
I do not.

5558
01:33:23,900 --> 01:33:24,740
I do assure you

5559
01:33:24,740 --> 01:33:25,640
that my intimacy

5560
01:33:25,640 --> 01:33:26,060
has not yet

5561
01:33:26,060 --> 01:33:27,260
taught me that

5562
01:33:27,380 --> 01:33:28,980
t.s calmness of manner

5563
01:33:28,980 --> 01:33:30,180
and presence of mine.

5564
01:33:30,320 --> 01:33:32,100
No, no fear.

5565
01:33:32,120 --> 01:33:33,560
He may defy us there.

5566
01:33:34,040 --> 01:33:34,520
It has to.

5567
01:33:34,520 --> 01:33:35,120
LAUGHTER

5568
01:33:35,120 --> 01:33:35,480
We will not

5569
01:33:35,480 --> 01:33:36,540
expose ourselves,

5570
01:33:36,540 --> 01:33:37,100
if you please,

5571
01:33:37,100 --> 01:33:38,000
by attempting to laugh

5572
01:33:38,000 --> 01:33:39,560
without a subject, Mr.

5573
01:33:39,560 --> 01:33:41,060
Darcy may hug himself.

5574
01:33:41,820 --> 01:33:42,200
Mr.

5575
01:33:42,200 --> 01:33:43,020
Darcy is not to be

5576
01:33:43,020 --> 01:33:44,000
laughed at.

5577
01:33:44,000 --> 01:33:45,200
Cried Elizabeth.

5578
01:33:45,240 --> 01:33:46,220
That is an uncommon

5579
01:33:46,220 --> 01:33:47,960
advantage and uncommon.

5580
01:33:47,960 --> 01:33:48,440
I hope it

5581
01:33:48,440 --> 01:33:49,700
will continue for

5582
01:33:49,700 --> 01:33:51,020
to be a great loss to me

5583
01:33:51,020 --> 01:33:51,320
to have

5584
01:33:51,320 --> 01:33:52,520
many such acquaintances.

5585
01:33:52,640 --> 01:33:54,300
I dearly love a laugh.

5586
01:33:54,800 --> 01:33:55,800
Miss Bingley.

5587
01:33:55,800 --> 01:33:56,600
Said he.

5588
01:33:56,600 --> 01:33:57,540
Has given me credit

5589
01:33:57,540 --> 01:33:57,900
for more

5590
01:33:57,900 --> 01:33:59,660
than can be the wisest

5591
01:33:59,660 --> 01:34:00,860
and best of men.

5592
01:34:00,860 --> 01:34:01,680
Nay, the wisest

5593
01:34:01,680 --> 01:34:02,180
and best of

5594
01:34:02,180 --> 01:34:03,180
their actions

5595
01:34:03,180 --> 01:34:03,900
may be rendered

5596
01:34:03,900 --> 01:34:05,160
ridiculous by a person

5597
01:34:05,160 --> 01:34:06,060
whose first object

5598
01:34:06,060 --> 01:34:07,340
in life is a joke.

5599
01:34:08,900 --> 01:34:09,900
Certainly,

5600
01:34:09,900 --> 01:34:11,100
replied Elizabeth.

5601
01:34:11,100 --> 01:34:12,300
There are such people.

5602
01:34:12,600 --> 01:34:13,400
But I hope I am

5603
01:34:13,400 --> 01:34:14,600
not one of them.

5604
01:34:14,640 --> 01:34:15,840
I hope I never ridicule

5605
01:34:15,840 --> 01:34:17,040
what is wise and good.

5606
01:34:18,060 --> 01:34:19,380
Follies and nonsense.

5607
01:34:19,380 --> 01:34:19,820
Whims

5608
01:34:19,820 --> 01:34:20,720
and inconsistencies

5609
01:34:20,720 --> 01:34:21,660
do divert me.

5610
01:34:21,660 --> 01:34:22,380
I own

5611
01:34:22,380 --> 01:34:23,220
and I laugh at them

5612
01:34:23,220 --> 01:34:24,420
whenever I can.

5613
01:34:26,660 --> 01:34:27,660
But these, I suppose,

5614
01:34:27,660 --> 01:34:28,400
are precisely

5615
01:34:28,400 --> 01:34:29,600
what you are without.

5616
01:34:30,620 --> 01:34:31,040
Perhaps

5617
01:34:31,040 --> 01:34:31,560
that is not

5618
01:34:31,560 --> 01:34:32,760
possible for anyone.

5619
01:34:33,060 --> 01:34:33,620
But it has

5620
01:34:33,620 --> 01:34:34,200
been the study

5621
01:34:34,200 --> 01:34:34,760
of my life

5622
01:34:34,760 --> 01:34:35,240
to avoid

5623
01:34:35,240 --> 01:34:36,120
those weaknesses

5624
01:34:36,120 --> 01:34:36,540
which often

5625
01:34:36,540 --> 01:34:37,380
expose a strong

5626
01:34:37,380 --> 01:34:37,860
understanding

5627
01:34:37,860 --> 01:34:39,060
to ridicule.

5628
01:34:39,840 --> 01:34:41,040
Such as vanity

5629
01:34:41,040 --> 01:34:42,240
and pride.

5630
01:34:42,780 --> 01:34:44,160
Yes, vanity

5631
01:34:44,160 --> 01:34:45,360
is a weakness indeed,

5632
01:34:45,620 --> 01:34:46,460
but pride

5633
01:34:46,460 --> 01:34:47,000
where there is

5634
01:34:47,000 --> 01:34:48,020
a real superiority

5635
01:34:48,020 --> 01:34:49,220
of mind.

5636
01:34:49,640 --> 01:34:50,660
Pride will be always

5637
01:34:50,660 --> 01:34:51,860
under good regulation.

5638
01:34:53,240 --> 01:34:54,440
Elizabeth turned away

5639
01:34:54,440 --> 01:34:55,640
to hide a smile.

5640
01:34:56,160 --> 01:34:57,240
Your examination of Mr.

5641
01:34:57,240 --> 01:34:58,020
Darcy is over,

5642
01:34:58,020 --> 01:34:59,240
I presume, said

5643
01:34:59,240 --> 01:35:00,140
Miss Bingley.

5644
01:35:00,140 --> 01:35:00,860
And pray.

5645
01:35:00,860 --> 01:35:02,060
What is the result?

5646
01:35:02,540 --> 01:35:03,360
I am perfectly

5647
01:35:03,360 --> 01:35:04,520
convinced by it that Mr.

5648
01:35:04,520 --> 01:35:05,940
Darcy has no defect.

5649
01:35:06,200 --> 01:35:07,400
He owns it himself.

5650
01:35:07,400 --> 01:35:08,600
Without disguise.

5651
01:35:09,540 --> 01:35:10,200
No.

5652
01:35:10,200 --> 01:35:11,180
Said Darcy.

5653
01:35:11,180 --> 01:35:11,660
I have made

5654
01:35:11,660 --> 01:35:12,860
no such pretension.

5655
01:35:13,700 --> 01:35:14,600
I have faults enough,

5656
01:35:14,600 --> 01:35:15,140
but they are not.

5657
01:35:15,140 --> 01:35:16,340
I hope of understanding

5658
01:35:17,160 --> 01:35:17,760
my temper.

5659
01:35:17,760 --> 01:35:18,980
I dare not vouch for.

5660
01:35:19,680 --> 01:35:20,580
It is, I believe,

5661
01:35:20,580 --> 01:35:21,720
too little yielding.

5662
01:35:21,720 --> 01:35:22,620
Certainly too little

5663
01:35:22,620 --> 01:35:22,820
for the

5664
01:35:22,820 --> 01:35:23,600
convenience of

5665
01:35:23,600 --> 01:35:24,120
the world.

5666
01:35:25,260 --> 01:35:25,740
I cannot

5667
01:35:25,740 --> 01:35:26,100
forget the

5668
01:35:26,100 --> 01:35:26,480
follies

5669
01:35:26,480 --> 01:35:27,680
and vices of others so

5670
01:35:27,680 --> 01:35:28,880
soon as I ought,

5671
01:35:29,340 --> 01:35:30,260
nor their offenses

5672
01:35:30,260 --> 01:35:31,460
against myself.

5673
01:35:32,180 --> 01:35:32,840
My feelings

5674
01:35:32,840 --> 01:35:33,660
are not puffed about

5675
01:35:33,660 --> 01:35:34,340
with every attempt

5676
01:35:34,340 --> 01:35:35,540
to move them.

5677
01:35:35,780 --> 01:35:36,540
My temper would

5678
01:35:36,540 --> 01:35:37,040
perhaps be

5679
01:35:37,040 --> 01:35:38,240
called resentful.

5680
01:35:39,020 --> 01:35:40,100
My good opinion, once

5681
01:35:40,100 --> 01:35:41,400
lost, is lost forever.

5682
01:35:43,220 --> 01:35:43,820
That is a

5683
01:35:43,820 --> 01:35:45,020
failing indeed.

5684
01:35:45,120 --> 01:35:46,280
Cried Elizabeth.

5685
01:35:46,280 --> 01:35:47,520
Implacable resentment

5686
01:35:47,520 --> 01:35:48,180
is a shade

5687
01:35:48,180 --> 01:35:49,380
in a character.

5688
01:35:49,500 --> 01:35:50,220
But you have chosen

5689
01:35:50,220 --> 01:35:50,760
your fault.

5690
01:35:50,760 --> 01:35:52,500
Well, I really cannot

5691
01:35:52,500 --> 01:35:53,700
laugh at it.

5692
01:35:53,840 --> 01:35:54,840
You are safe

5693
01:35:54,840 --> 01:35:56,040
from me.

5694
01:35:56,840 --> 01:35:57,260
There is,

5695
01:35:57,260 --> 01:35:57,860
I believe, in

5696
01:35:57,860 --> 01:35:58,800
every disposition.

5697
01:35:58,800 --> 01:35:59,420
The tendency

5698
01:35:59,420 --> 01:36:00,620
to some particular evil.

5699
01:36:01,560 --> 01:36:02,760
A natural defect

5700
01:36:02,960 --> 01:36:03,960
which not even best

5701
01:36:03,960 --> 01:36:05,240
education can overcome.

5702
01:36:06,740 --> 01:36:07,800
And your defect

5703
01:36:07,800 --> 01:36:09,000
is to hate everybody.

5704
01:36:09,680 --> 01:36:10,860
And yours.

5705
01:36:10,860 --> 01:36:12,060
He replied with a smile.

5706
01:36:12,500 --> 01:36:13,400
Is willfully

5707
01:36:13,400 --> 01:36:14,600
to misunderstand them.

5708
01:36:15,020 --> 01:36:15,660
Do not just have

5709
01:36:15,660 --> 01:36:16,860
a little music.

5710
01:36:16,980 --> 01:36:18,080
Kindness Bingley.

5711
01:36:18,080 --> 01:36:18,580
Tired of

5712
01:36:18,580 --> 01:36:19,260
the conversation

5713
01:36:19,260 --> 01:36:19,500
in which

5714
01:36:19,500 --> 01:36:20,700
she had no share.

5715
01:36:21,000 --> 01:36:21,920
Louisa.

5716
01:36:21,920 --> 01:36:22,740
You will not mind

5717
01:36:22,740 --> 01:36:23,360
my waking Mr.

5718
01:36:23,360 --> 01:36:24,500
Hurst.

5719
01:36:24,500 --> 01:36:25,380
Her sister had not

5720
01:36:25,380 --> 01:36:26,580
the smallest objection.

5721
01:36:26,700 --> 01:36:26,960
And the.

5722
01:36:26,960 --> 01:36:28,260
Pianoforte was opened.

5723
01:36:28,560 --> 01:36:29,340
And Darcy,

5724
01:36:29,340 --> 01:36:30,200
after a few moments

5725
01:36:30,200 --> 01:36:31,260
recollection was not

5726
01:36:31,260 --> 01:36:32,460
sorry for it.

5727
01:36:32,460 --> 01:36:33,300
He began to

5728
01:36:33,300 --> 01:36:34,340
the danger of paying

5729
01:36:34,340 --> 01:36:35,120
Elizabeth too

5730
01:36:35,120 --> 01:36:36,300
much attention.

5731
01:36:37,980 --> 01:36:39,180
Chapter 12.

5732
01:36:39,740 --> 01:36:40,740
In consequence of

5733
01:36:40,740 --> 01:36:41,240
an agreement

5734
01:36:41,240 --> 01:36:42,360
between the sisters,

5735
01:36:42,360 --> 01:36:43,100
Elizabeth wrote

5736
01:36:43,100 --> 01:36:43,860
to the next morning

5737
01:36:43,860 --> 01:36:45,180
to their mother to beg

5738
01:36:45,180 --> 01:36:45,800
that the carriage

5739
01:36:45,800 --> 01:36:46,740
might be sent for them

5740
01:36:46,740 --> 01:36:47,180
in the course

5741
01:36:47,180 --> 01:36:48,200
of the day.

5742
01:36:48,200 --> 01:36:48,740
But Mrs.

5743
01:36:48,740 --> 01:36:49,140
Bennett,

5744
01:36:49,140 --> 01:36:49,920
who had calculated

5745
01:36:49,920 --> 01:36:50,540
on her daughters

5746
01:36:50,540 --> 01:36:51,540
remaining at Netherfield

5747
01:36:51,540 --> 01:36:52,740
to the following Tuesday

5748
01:36:52,920 --> 01:36:53,240
which would

5749
01:36:53,240 --> 01:36:54,540
exactly finish Jane's

5750
01:36:54,540 --> 01:36:55,160
week,

5751
01:36:55,160 --> 01:36:56,240
could not bring herself

5752
01:36:56,240 --> 01:36:56,840
to receive them

5753
01:36:56,840 --> 01:36:58,040
with pleasure before

5754
01:36:58,500 --> 01:36:59,480
her answer, therefore

5755
01:36:59,480 --> 01:37:00,600
was not propitious,

5756
01:37:00,600 --> 01:37:01,460
at least not to.

5757
01:37:01,460 --> 01:37:02,820
Elizabeth's wishes, for

5758
01:37:02,820 --> 01:37:03,660
she was impatient

5759
01:37:03,660 --> 01:37:04,860
to get home.

5760
01:37:04,920 --> 01:37:05,280
Mrs.

5761
01:37:05,280 --> 01:37:06,060
Bennett sent them

5762
01:37:06,060 --> 01:37:06,440
word that they

5763
01:37:06,440 --> 01:37:07,340
could not possibly

5764
01:37:07,340 --> 01:37:07,940
have the carriage

5765
01:37:07,940 --> 01:37:09,080
before Tuesday,

5766
01:37:09,080 --> 01:37:10,020
and in her postscript,

5767
01:37:10,020 --> 01:37:11,340
it was added that if Mr.

5768
01:37:11,340 --> 01:37:12,180
Bingley and his sister

5769
01:37:12,180 --> 01:37:12,720
pressed them

5770
01:37:12,720 --> 01:37:13,640
to stay longer,

5771
01:37:13,640 --> 01:37:14,580
she could spare them

5772
01:37:14,580 --> 01:37:15,780
very well.

5773
01:37:15,780 --> 01:37:17,060
Against staying longer,

5774
01:37:17,060 --> 01:37:17,780
however, Elizabeth

5775
01:37:17,780 --> 01:37:19,140
was positively resolved.

5776
01:37:19,460 --> 01:37:20,760
Nor did she much expect

5777
01:37:20,760 --> 01:37:21,620
it would be asked

5778
01:37:21,620 --> 01:37:22,340
and fearful,

5779
01:37:22,340 --> 01:37:23,160
on the contrary,

5780
01:37:23,160 --> 01:37:23,960
as being considered

5781
01:37:23,960 --> 01:37:25,020
as intruding themselves

5782
01:37:25,020 --> 01:37:26,220
needlessly long.

5783
01:37:26,220 --> 01:37:27,300
She urged Jane

5784
01:37:27,300 --> 01:37:27,960
to borrow Mr.

5785
01:37:27,960 --> 01:37:28,340
Bigley's

5786
01:37:28,340 --> 01:37:29,540
carriage immediately

5787
01:37:29,580 --> 01:37:30,360
and at length.

5788
01:37:30,360 --> 01:37:30,980
It was settled

5789
01:37:30,980 --> 01:37:31,260
that their

5790
01:37:31,260 --> 01:37:31,940
original design

5791
01:37:31,940 --> 01:37:32,720
of leaving Netherfield

5792
01:37:32,720 --> 01:37:33,360
that morning

5793
01:37:33,360 --> 01:37:34,260
should be mentioned,

5794
01:37:34,260 --> 01:37:35,160
and the request.

5795
01:37:35,160 --> 01:37:37,080
Made the communication.

5796
01:37:37,080 --> 01:37:37,500
Excited

5797
01:37:37,500 --> 01:37:38,220
many professions

5798
01:37:38,220 --> 01:37:39,140
of concern.

5799
01:37:39,140 --> 01:37:40,220
And enough was said of

5800
01:37:40,220 --> 01:37:40,940
wishing them to stay

5801
01:37:40,940 --> 01:37:41,280
at least

5802
01:37:41,280 --> 01:37:42,240
till the following day,

5803
01:37:42,240 --> 01:37:43,440
to work on Jane

5804
01:37:43,580 --> 01:37:44,400
until the morrow.

5805
01:37:44,400 --> 01:37:44,880
Their going

5806
01:37:44,880 --> 01:37:46,020
was deferred.

5807
01:37:46,020 --> 01:37:46,760
Miss Bingley was

5808
01:37:46,760 --> 01:37:47,280
then sorry

5809
01:37:47,280 --> 01:37:48,040
that she had proposed

5810
01:37:48,040 --> 01:37:48,800
the delay.

5811
01:37:48,800 --> 01:37:49,560
For her jealousy

5812
01:37:49,560 --> 01:37:50,160
and dislike of

5813
01:37:50,160 --> 01:37:51,600
one sister much exceeded

5814
01:37:51,600 --> 01:37:52,260
her affection

5815
01:37:52,260 --> 01:37:52,920
for the other.

5816
01:37:53,900 --> 01:37:54,920
The master of the house

5817
01:37:54,920 --> 01:37:55,920
heard with real sorrow

5818
01:37:55,920 --> 01:37:56,240
that they were

5819
01:37:56,240 --> 01:37:57,440
to go so soon

5820
01:37:57,440 --> 01:37:58,440
and repeatedly tried

5821
01:37:58,440 --> 01:37:59,420
to persuade Miss Bennet

5822
01:37:59,420 --> 01:37:59,660
that it would

5823
01:37:59,660 --> 01:38:00,860
not be safer.

5824
01:38:00,860 --> 01:38:01,260
But she was

5825
01:38:01,260 --> 01:38:02,460
not enough recovered.

5826
01:38:02,540 --> 01:38:03,620
But Jane was firm

5827
01:38:03,620 --> 01:38:04,440
where she felt herself

5828
01:38:04,440 --> 01:38:05,640
to be, right?

5829
01:38:05,780 --> 01:38:06,300
To Mr.

5830
01:38:06,300 --> 01:38:06,840
Darcy,

5831
01:38:06,840 --> 01:38:07,520
it was a welcome

5832
01:38:07,520 --> 01:38:08,580
intelligence.

5833
01:38:08,580 --> 01:38:09,380
Elizabeth had been

5834
01:38:09,380 --> 01:38:09,980
at Netherfield

5835
01:38:09,980 --> 01:38:11,000
long enough.

5836
01:38:11,000 --> 01:38:11,900
She attracted him

5837
01:38:11,900 --> 01:38:13,040
more than he liked.

5838
01:38:13,040 --> 01:38:13,800
And Miss Bingley

5839
01:38:13,800 --> 01:38:14,960
was uncivil to her.

5840
01:38:14,960 --> 01:38:16,020
And more teasing than

5841
01:38:16,020 --> 01:38:17,220
usual to himself.

5842
01:38:17,520 --> 01:38:18,560
He wisely resolved

5843
01:38:18,560 --> 01:38:18,740
to be

5844
01:38:18,740 --> 01:38:19,760
particularly careful

5845
01:38:19,760 --> 01:38:20,400
that no sign

5846
01:38:20,400 --> 01:38:21,060
of admiration

5847
01:38:21,060 --> 01:38:22,260
should now escape him.

5848
01:38:22,580 --> 01:38:23,180
Nothing that

5849
01:38:23,180 --> 01:38:23,960
could elevate her

5850
01:38:23,960 --> 01:38:24,360
with the hope

5851
01:38:24,360 --> 01:38:25,040
of influencing

5852
01:38:25,040 --> 01:38:26,100
his felicity.

5853
01:38:26,100 --> 01:38:26,700
Sensible

5854
01:38:26,700 --> 01:38:27,560
that if such an idea

5855
01:38:27,560 --> 01:38:28,640
had been suggested,

5856
01:38:28,640 --> 01:38:29,420
his behavior

5857
01:38:29,420 --> 01:38:30,560
during the last day

5858
01:38:30,560 --> 01:38:30,980
must have

5859
01:38:30,980 --> 01:38:31,820
material weight

5860
01:38:31,820 --> 01:38:32,480
and confirming

5861
01:38:32,480 --> 01:38:33,000
or crushing.

5862
01:38:33,000 --> 01:38:34,080
It steady.

5863
01:38:34,080 --> 01:38:35,000
To his purpose.

5864
01:38:35,000 --> 01:38:35,960
He scarcely spoke

5865
01:38:35,960 --> 01:38:36,860
ten words to her

5866
01:38:36,860 --> 01:38:37,320
through the whole

5867
01:38:37,320 --> 01:38:38,660
of Saturday, and though

5868
01:38:38,660 --> 01:38:38,960
they were

5869
01:38:38,960 --> 01:38:40,640
at one time left by for

5870
01:38:40,640 --> 01:38:41,580
half an hour,

5871
01:38:41,580 --> 01:38:42,420
he adhered most.

5872
01:38:42,420 --> 01:38:43,280
Conscientiously to

5873
01:38:43,280 --> 01:38:44,520
his book and would not.

5874
01:38:44,520 --> 01:38:45,720
Even look at her.

5875
01:38:45,840 --> 01:38:46,680
On Sunday.

5876
01:38:46,680 --> 01:38:47,880
After morning service.

5877
01:38:48,000 --> 01:38:48,920
The separation

5878
01:38:48,920 --> 01:38:50,180
so agreeable to almost

5879
01:38:50,180 --> 01:38:51,380
all took place.

5880
01:38:51,800 --> 01:38:53,000
Miss Bingley civility

5881
01:38:53,000 --> 01:38:54,080
to Elizabeth increased

5882
01:38:54,080 --> 01:38:55,400
at last very rapidly,

5883
01:38:55,620 --> 01:38:56,700
as well as her affection

5884
01:38:56,700 --> 01:38:57,500
for Jane.

5885
01:38:57,500 --> 01:38:58,520
And when they parted

5886
01:38:58,520 --> 01:38:59,360
after assuring

5887
01:38:59,360 --> 01:39:00,260
latter of the pleasure,

5888
01:39:00,260 --> 01:39:01,160
it would always give her

5889
01:39:01,160 --> 01:39:01,920
to see her either

5890
01:39:01,920 --> 01:39:02,600
at Long Bourn

5891
01:39:02,600 --> 01:39:03,560
or Netherfield,

5892
01:39:03,560 --> 01:39:04,320
and embracing her

5893
01:39:04,320 --> 01:39:05,460
most tenderly.

5894
01:39:05,460 --> 01:39:06,240
She even shook

5895
01:39:06,240 --> 01:39:07,440
hands with the former.

5896
01:39:07,800 --> 01:39:08,580
Elizabeth took

5897
01:39:08,580 --> 01:39:09,000
leave of the

5898
01:39:09,000 --> 01:39:10,020
whole party in the

5899
01:39:10,020 --> 01:39:11,340
liveliest of spirits.

5900
01:39:12,300 --> 01:39:12,600
They were

5901
01:39:12,600 --> 01:39:13,340
not welcomed home

5902
01:39:13,340 --> 01:39:14,100
very cordially

5903
01:39:14,100 --> 01:39:15,080
by their mother.

5904
01:39:15,080 --> 01:39:15,480
Mrs.

5905
01:39:15,480 --> 01:39:15,800
Bennett

5906
01:39:15,800 --> 01:39:17,000
wondered at their coming

5907
01:39:17,120 --> 01:39:17,540
and thought

5908
01:39:17,540 --> 01:39:18,440
them very wrong

5909
01:39:18,440 --> 01:39:19,620
to give so much

5910
01:39:19,620 --> 01:39:20,240
and was sure

5911
01:39:20,240 --> 01:39:20,760
Jane would have

5912
01:39:20,760 --> 01:39:21,960
caught cold again.

5913
01:39:22,160 --> 01:39:23,520
But their father, though

5914
01:39:23,520 --> 01:39:24,360
very laconic

5915
01:39:24,360 --> 01:39:24,560
in his

5916
01:39:24,560 --> 01:39:25,760
expressions of pleasure,

5917
01:39:25,760 --> 01:39:26,700
was really glad

5918
01:39:26,700 --> 01:39:27,620
to see them.

5919
01:39:27,620 --> 01:39:28,160
He had felt

5920
01:39:28,160 --> 01:39:28,820
their importance

5921
01:39:28,820 --> 01:39:30,020
in the family circle.

5922
01:39:30,260 --> 01:39:31,460
The evening conversation

5923
01:39:31,460 --> 01:39:31,760
when they were

5924
01:39:31,760 --> 01:39:33,120
all assembled had lost

5925
01:39:33,120 --> 01:39:34,320
much of its animation

5926
01:39:34,500 --> 01:39:35,940
and almost all its sense

5927
01:39:35,940 --> 01:39:37,220
by the absence of Jane

5928
01:39:37,220 --> 01:39:38,420
and Elizabeth.

5929
01:39:38,900 --> 01:39:39,800
They found Mary,

5930
01:39:39,800 --> 01:39:40,340
as usual,

5931
01:39:40,340 --> 01:39:40,760
deep in the

5932
01:39:40,760 --> 01:39:42,020
study of Thoreau base

5933
01:39:42,020 --> 01:39:43,220
and human nature,

5934
01:39:43,220 --> 01:39:44,300
and had some extracts

5935
01:39:44,300 --> 01:39:45,180
to admire

5936
01:39:45,180 --> 01:39:45,680
and some

5937
01:39:45,680 --> 01:39:46,520
new observations

5938
01:39:46,520 --> 01:39:47,660
of threadbare morality

5939
01:39:47,660 --> 01:39:48,860
to listen to.

5940
01:39:48,920 --> 01:39:49,860
Catherine and Lydia

5941
01:39:49,860 --> 01:39:50,520
had information

5942
01:39:50,520 --> 01:39:50,820
for them

5943
01:39:50,820 --> 01:39:52,020
of a different sort.

5944
01:39:52,100 --> 01:39:52,740
Much had been.

5945
01:39:52,740 --> 01:39:53,340
Done and much

5946
01:39:53,340 --> 01:39:53,880
had been said

5947
01:39:53,880 --> 01:39:54,480
in the regiment

5948
01:39:54,480 --> 01:39:55,200
since the preceding

5949
01:39:55,200 --> 01:39:56,040
Wednesday.

5950
01:39:56,040 --> 01:39:57,140
Several of the officers

5951
01:39:57,140 --> 01:39:57,960
had dined lately

5952
01:39:57,960 --> 01:39:58,920
with their uncle.

5953
01:39:58,920 --> 01:39:59,900
A private had been.

5954
01:39:59,900 --> 01:40:00,740
Flogged.

5955
01:40:00,740 --> 01:40:01,500
And it had actually

5956
01:40:01,500 --> 01:40:02,040
been hinted

5957
01:40:02,040 --> 01:40:03,000
that Colonel Forrester

5958
01:40:03,000 --> 01:40:04,140
was going to be married.

5959
01:40:05,820 --> 01:40:07,020
Chapter 13.

5960
01:40:08,300 --> 01:40:09,600
I hope my dear.

5961
01:40:10,080 --> 01:40:10,580
Said Mr.

5962
01:40:10,580 --> 01:40:11,480
Bennett to his wife,

5963
01:40:11,480 --> 01:40:11,960
as they were

5964
01:40:11,960 --> 01:40:12,540
at breakfast

5965
01:40:12,540 --> 01:40:13,740
the next morning.

5966
01:40:13,760 --> 01:40:14,540
That you have ordered

5967
01:40:14,540 --> 01:40:15,740
a good dinner today,

5968
01:40:15,900 --> 01:40:16,880
because I have reason

5969
01:40:16,880 --> 01:40:18,080
to expect an addition

5970
01:40:18,080 --> 01:40:19,440
to our family party.

5971
01:40:19,700 --> 01:40:20,460
What do you mean,

5972
01:40:20,460 --> 01:40:21,380
my dear?

5973
01:40:21,380 --> 01:40:22,320
I know nobody

5974
01:40:22,320 --> 01:40:22,920
that is coming.

5975
01:40:22,920 --> 01:40:23,880
I am sure,

5976
01:40:23,880 --> 01:40:25,080
unless Charlotte Lucas

5977
01:40:25,080 --> 01:40:25,500
should happen

5978
01:40:25,500 --> 01:40:26,300
to call in.

5979
01:40:26,300 --> 01:40:27,600
And I hope my dinners

5980
01:40:27,600 --> 01:40:28,800
are good enough for her.

5981
01:40:28,880 --> 01:40:29,720
I do not believe

5982
01:40:29,720 --> 01:40:30,440
she often sees

5983
01:40:30,440 --> 01:40:31,640
such at home.

5984
01:40:31,920 --> 01:40:32,640
The person of

5985
01:40:32,640 --> 01:40:33,860
whom I speak is

5986
01:40:33,860 --> 01:40:34,740
a gentleman

5987
01:40:34,740 --> 01:40:35,940
and a stranger.

5988
01:40:36,560 --> 01:40:36,960
Mrs.

5989
01:40:36,960 --> 01:40:38,420
Bennett's eyes sparkled.

5990
01:40:38,960 --> 01:40:40,260
That gentleman

5991
01:40:40,260 --> 01:40:41,760
and a stranger.

5992
01:40:42,260 --> 01:40:43,020
It is Mr.

5993
01:40:43,020 --> 01:40:44,420
Bingley, I am sure.

5994
01:40:44,720 --> 01:40:45,680
Well, I am sure.

5995
01:40:45,680 --> 01:40:46,700
I shall be extremely

5996
01:40:46,700 --> 01:40:47,060
glad.

5997
01:40:47,060 --> 01:40:47,480
See, Mr.

5998
01:40:47,480 --> 01:40:48,320
Bingley.

5999
01:40:48,320 --> 01:40:49,500
But good Lord,

6000
01:40:49,500 --> 01:40:50,700
how unlucky.

6001
01:40:50,720 --> 01:40:51,200
There is not

6002
01:40:51,200 --> 01:40:51,740
a bit of fish

6003
01:40:51,740 --> 01:40:52,940
to be got today.

6004
01:40:53,280 --> 01:40:54,320
Lydia, my love.

6005
01:40:54,320 --> 01:40:54,860
Ring the bell.

6006
01:40:54,860 --> 01:40:56,040
I must speak to Hill.

6007
01:40:56,040 --> 01:40:57,240
This moment.

6008
01:40:57,260 --> 01:40:58,340
It is not Mr.

6009
01:40:58,340 --> 01:40:59,300
Bingley.

6010
01:40:59,300 --> 01:41:00,500
Said her husband.

6011
01:41:00,540 --> 01:41:01,740
It is a person

6012
01:41:01,740 --> 01:41:02,600
whom I never saw

6013
01:41:02,600 --> 01:41:03,060
in the whole

6014
01:41:03,060 --> 01:41:04,260
course of my life.

6015
01:41:04,980 --> 01:41:05,880
This roused

6016
01:41:05,880 --> 01:41:06,360
a general

6017
01:41:06,360 --> 01:41:07,340
astonished mint,

6018
01:41:07,340 --> 01:41:08,400
and he had the pleasure

6019
01:41:08,400 --> 01:41:08,780
of being

6020
01:41:08,780 --> 01:41:09,780
eagerly questioned

6021
01:41:09,780 --> 01:41:10,700
by his wife

6022
01:41:10,700 --> 01:41:11,940
and his five daughters

6023
01:41:11,940 --> 01:41:13,040
at once.

6024
01:41:13,040 --> 01:41:14,280
After amusing himself

6025
01:41:14,280 --> 01:41:14,840
some time

6026
01:41:14,840 --> 01:41:16,040
with their curiosity,

6027
01:41:16,080 --> 01:41:17,060
he thus explain.

6028
01:41:18,360 --> 01:41:19,460
About a month ago I

6029
01:41:19,460 --> 01:41:20,660
received this letter,

6030
01:41:22,020 --> 01:41:22,460
and about

6031
01:41:22,460 --> 01:41:23,400
a fortnight ago

6032
01:41:23,400 --> 01:41:24,740
I answered it for

6033
01:41:24,740 --> 01:41:25,320
I thought it

6034
01:41:25,320 --> 01:41:26,840
a case of some delicacy

6035
01:41:27,020 --> 01:41:27,900
and requiring

6036
01:41:27,900 --> 01:41:29,100
early attention.

6037
01:41:30,180 --> 01:41:30,800
It is from

6038
01:41:30,800 --> 01:41:31,820
my cousin, Mr.

6039
01:41:31,820 --> 01:41:32,540
Collins, who,

6040
01:41:32,540 --> 01:41:33,980
when I am dead, may

6041
01:41:33,980 --> 01:41:34,680
turn you all

6042
01:41:34,680 --> 01:41:35,520
out of this house

6043
01:41:35,520 --> 01:41:36,800
as soon as he pleases.

6044
01:41:37,260 --> 01:41:38,480
Oh, my dear.

6045
01:41:38,840 --> 01:41:39,380
Cried his.

6046
01:41:39,380 --> 01:41:40,080
Wife.

6047
01:41:40,080 --> 01:41:41,640
I cannot bear to hear

6048
01:41:41,640 --> 01:41:42,840
that mentioned.

6049
01:41:42,880 --> 01:41:43,160
Pray.

6050
01:41:43,160 --> 01:41:44,360
Do not talk of that

6051
01:41:44,360 --> 01:41:45,560
odious man.

6052
01:41:45,600 --> 01:41:46,380
I do think it is

6053
01:41:46,380 --> 01:41:47,120
the harshest thing

6054
01:41:47,120 --> 01:41:47,640
in the world

6055
01:41:47,640 --> 01:41:48,300
that your state

6056
01:41:48,300 --> 01:41:49,100
should be entailed away

6057
01:41:49,100 --> 01:41:50,300
from your own children.

6058
01:41:50,540 --> 01:41:51,380
And I am sure

6059
01:41:51,380 --> 01:41:52,580
if I had been you,

6060
01:41:52,680 --> 01:41:53,220
I should have

6061
01:41:53,220 --> 01:41:54,000
tried long ago

6062
01:41:54,000 --> 01:41:54,620
to do something

6063
01:41:54,620 --> 01:41:55,820
rather about it.

6064
01:41:56,540 --> 01:41:57,660
Jane and Elizabeth

6065
01:41:57,660 --> 01:41:58,860
tried to explain to her

6066
01:41:58,860 --> 01:41:59,360
the nature

6067
01:41:59,360 --> 01:42:00,560
of an and tale.

6068
01:42:00,620 --> 01:42:01,620
They had often attempted

6069
01:42:01,620 --> 01:42:03,020
to do it before, but

6070
01:42:03,020 --> 01:42:03,780
it was a subject

6071
01:42:03,780 --> 01:42:04,440
on which Mrs.

6072
01:42:04,440 --> 01:42:05,420
Bennett was beyond

6073
01:42:05,420 --> 01:42:06,620
the reach of reason.

6074
01:42:06,680 --> 01:42:06,980
And she.

6075
01:42:06,980 --> 01:42:07,800
Continued to rail

6076
01:42:07,800 --> 01:42:08,280
bitterly

6077
01:42:08,280 --> 01:42:09,240
against the cruelty

6078
01:42:09,240 --> 01:42:10,200
of settling in a state

6079
01:42:10,200 --> 01:42:10,680
away from a

6080
01:42:10,680 --> 01:42:11,460
family of five.

6081
01:42:11,460 --> 01:42:12,320
Daughters

6082
01:42:12,320 --> 01:42:13,500
in favor of a man whom.

6083
01:42:13,500 --> 01:42:14,220
Nobody cared

6084
01:42:14,220 --> 01:42:15,080
anything about.

6085
01:42:16,200 --> 01:42:17,160
It certainly is

6086
01:42:17,160 --> 01:42:17,580
a most

6087
01:42:17,580 --> 01:42:18,780
iniquitous affair.

6088
01:42:18,960 --> 01:42:19,440
Said Mr.

6089
01:42:19,440 --> 01:42:20,160
Bennett.

6090
01:42:20,160 --> 01:42:20,760
And nothing

6091
01:42:20,760 --> 01:42:21,500
can clear Mr.

6092
01:42:21,500 --> 01:42:22,520
Collins from the guilt

6093
01:42:22,520 --> 01:42:23,180
of inheriting

6094
01:42:23,180 --> 01:42:24,020
Long Bourn.

6095
01:42:24,020 --> 01:42:24,540
But if you will

6096
01:42:24,540 --> 01:42:25,520
listen to his letter,

6097
01:42:25,520 --> 01:42:26,720
you may perhaps

6098
01:42:26,760 --> 01:42:27,800
be a little softened

6099
01:42:27,800 --> 01:42:28,440
by his manner

6100
01:42:28,440 --> 01:42:29,640
of expressing himself.

6101
01:42:30,620 --> 01:42:32,160
Know that I am

6102
01:42:32,160 --> 01:42:33,360
sure I shall not.

6103
01:42:33,420 --> 01:42:34,200
And I think it is

6104
01:42:34,200 --> 01:42:35,360
very impertinent of him

6105
01:42:35,360 --> 01:42:36,560
to write to you at all

6106
01:42:36,600 --> 01:42:37,940
and very hypocritical.

6107
01:42:38,280 --> 01:42:39,260
I hate such

6108
01:42:39,260 --> 01:42:40,460
false friends.

6109
01:42:40,760 --> 01:42:41,460
Why could he not

6110
01:42:41,460 --> 01:42:41,900
keep on

6111
01:42:41,900 --> 01:42:42,780
quarreling with you

6112
01:42:42,780 --> 01:42:43,440
as his father

6113
01:42:43,440 --> 01:42:44,640
did before him?

6114
01:42:45,020 --> 01:42:46,220
Why?

6115
01:42:46,640 --> 01:42:47,580
He does seem to have had

6116
01:42:47,580 --> 01:42:48,780
some filial scruples

6117
01:42:48,780 --> 01:42:49,320
on that head.

6118
01:42:49,320 --> 01:42:50,520
As you will hear.

6119
01:42:53,660 --> 01:42:55,140
Hansford near West Kent,

6120
01:42:55,140 --> 01:42:56,540
the 15th of October.

6121
01:42:59,480 --> 01:43:00,680
Dear Sir,

6122
01:43:01,560 --> 01:43:02,480
the disagreement

6123
01:43:02,480 --> 01:43:03,140
subsisting

6124
01:43:03,140 --> 01:43:03,900
between yourself

6125
01:43:03,900 --> 01:43:04,140
and my

6126
01:43:04,140 --> 01:43:05,340
late honored father

6127
01:43:06,740 --> 01:43:07,100
always

6128
01:43:07,100 --> 01:43:08,360
gave me much uneasiness.

6129
01:43:09,960 --> 01:43:10,800
And since I have had

6130
01:43:10,800 --> 01:43:11,460
the misfortune

6131
01:43:11,460 --> 01:43:12,660
to lose him,

6132
01:43:13,200 --> 01:43:14,000
I have frequently

6133
01:43:14,000 --> 01:43:14,780
wished to heal

6134
01:43:14,780 --> 01:43:15,980
the breach.

6135
01:43:16,440 --> 01:43:17,640
But for some time,

6136
01:43:17,760 --> 01:43:18,740
I was back

6137
01:43:18,740 --> 01:43:19,940
by my own doubts,

6138
01:43:20,120 --> 01:43:21,200
fearing lest

6139
01:43:21,200 --> 01:43:21,560
it might

6140
01:43:21,560 --> 01:43:22,700
seem disrespectful

6141
01:43:22,700 --> 01:43:24,260
to his memory for me

6142
01:43:24,260 --> 01:43:25,620
to be on good terms

6143
01:43:25,620 --> 01:43:27,000
with anyone with whom

6144
01:43:27,000 --> 01:43:28,380
it had always him

6145
01:43:28,560 --> 01:43:29,760
to be at variance.

6146
01:43:30,260 --> 01:43:31,020
There, Mrs.

6147
01:43:31,020 --> 01:43:31,980
Bennett.

6148
01:43:31,980 --> 01:43:33,200
My mind, however, is

6149
01:43:33,200 --> 01:43:33,720
now made

6150
01:43:33,720 --> 01:43:34,920
up on the subject

6151
01:43:34,980 --> 01:43:36,260
for having

6152
01:43:36,260 --> 01:43:37,400
received ordination

6153
01:43:37,400 --> 01:43:38,600
at Easter.

6154
01:43:38,700 --> 01:43:39,920
I have been so fortunate

6155
01:43:39,920 --> 01:43:40,820
as to be distinguished

6156
01:43:40,820 --> 01:43:42,020
by the patronage

6157
01:43:42,380 --> 01:43:43,140
of the right.

6158
01:43:43,140 --> 01:43:44,660
Honorable Lady Katherine

6159
01:43:44,660 --> 01:43:45,860
de Borg,

6160
01:43:46,260 --> 01:43:47,100
widow of Sir

6161
01:43:47,100 --> 01:43:48,300
Louis de Borg,

6162
01:43:48,320 --> 01:43:48,980
whose bounty

6163
01:43:48,980 --> 01:43:50,000
and beneficence

6164
01:43:50,000 --> 01:43:50,840
has preferred me

6165
01:43:50,840 --> 01:43:52,100
to the valuable rectory

6166
01:43:52,100 --> 01:43:53,300
of this parish,

6167
01:43:53,880 --> 01:43:54,480
where it should be

6168
01:43:54,480 --> 01:43:55,580
my earnest endeavor

6169
01:43:55,580 --> 01:43:56,780
to demean myself

6170
01:43:56,780 --> 01:43:57,960
with grateful respect

6171
01:43:57,960 --> 01:43:59,180
towards Her Ladyship

6172
01:43:59,480 --> 01:44:00,320
and be ever ready

6173
01:44:00,320 --> 01:44:00,980
to perform

6174
01:44:00,980 --> 01:44:01,760
those rights

6175
01:44:01,760 --> 01:44:02,760
and ceremonies

6176
01:44:02,760 --> 01:44:03,800
which are instituted

6177
01:44:03,800 --> 01:44:04,400
by the Church

6178
01:44:04,400 --> 01:44:04,980
of England.

6179
01:44:07,580 --> 01:44:08,360
As a clergyman,

6180
01:44:08,360 --> 01:44:09,560
moreover,

6181
01:44:09,800 --> 01:44:10,880
I feel it my duty

6182
01:44:10,880 --> 01:44:12,180
to promote and establish

6183
01:44:12,180 --> 01:44:13,380
the blessing of peace

6184
01:44:13,380 --> 01:44:14,240
in all families

6185
01:44:14,240 --> 01:44:14,940
within the reach

6186
01:44:14,940 --> 01:44:16,140
of my influence.

6187
01:44:16,520 --> 01:44:17,540
And on these grounds,

6188
01:44:17,540 --> 01:44:18,740
I flatter myself

6189
01:44:19,040 --> 01:44:19,760
that my present

6190
01:44:19,760 --> 01:44:20,940
overtures of goodwill

6191
01:44:20,940 --> 01:44:22,140
are highly commendable

6192
01:44:22,620 --> 01:44:22,940
and that

6193
01:44:22,940 --> 01:44:23,880
the circumstance

6194
01:44:23,880 --> 01:44:24,900
of my being next

6195
01:44:24,900 --> 01:44:26,100
in the entail of long

6196
01:44:26,100 --> 01:44:27,120
born estate

6197
01:44:27,120 --> 01:44:27,980
will be kindly

6198
01:44:27,980 --> 01:44:29,480
overlooked on your side

6199
01:44:29,840 --> 01:44:30,680
and not lead you

6200
01:44:30,680 --> 01:44:32,000
to reject the offered

6201
01:44:32,000 --> 01:44:33,200
olive branch.

6202
01:44:33,680 --> 01:44:34,860
I cannot be otherwise

6203
01:44:34,860 --> 01:44:35,780
than concerned

6204
01:44:35,780 --> 01:44:36,600
of being the means

6205
01:44:36,600 --> 01:44:37,280
of injuring

6206
01:44:37,280 --> 01:44:38,520
your amiable daughters

6207
01:44:38,820 --> 01:44:39,240
and beg

6208
01:44:39,240 --> 01:44:40,400
leave to apologize

6209
01:44:40,400 --> 01:44:41,060
for it,

6210
01:44:41,060 --> 01:44:41,420
as well

6211
01:44:41,420 --> 01:44:42,180
as to assure you

6212
01:44:42,180 --> 01:44:43,040
of my readiness

6213
01:44:43,040 --> 01:44:43,560
to make them

6214
01:44:43,560 --> 01:44:44,900
every possible amends.

6215
01:44:45,620 --> 01:44:46,280
But of this

6216
01:44:46,280 --> 01:44:47,480
hereafter,

6217
01:44:47,660 --> 01:44:48,380
if you should have

6218
01:44:48,380 --> 01:44:49,100
no objection

6219
01:44:49,100 --> 01:44:49,860
to receive me

6220
01:44:49,860 --> 01:44:51,060
into your house,

6221
01:44:51,180 --> 01:44:52,260
I propose myself

6222
01:44:52,260 --> 01:44:53,100
the satisfaction

6223
01:44:53,100 --> 01:44:53,940
of waiting on you

6224
01:44:53,940 --> 01:44:54,720
and your family.

6225
01:44:56,000 --> 01:44:56,980
Monday, November

6226
01:44:56,980 --> 01:44:58,520
18th, by 4:00.

6227
01:44:58,760 --> 01:44:59,220
And she'll

6228
01:44:59,220 --> 01:45:00,180
probably trespass

6229
01:45:00,180 --> 01:45:01,440
on your hospitality

6230
01:45:01,640 --> 01:45:02,480
till the Saturday

6231
01:45:02,480 --> 01:45:03,680
said night following

6232
01:45:03,840 --> 01:45:04,920
which I can do without

6233
01:45:04,920 --> 01:45:06,120
any inconvenience.

6234
01:45:06,480 --> 01:45:06,960
As Lady

6235
01:45:06,960 --> 01:45:07,820
Catherine is far

6236
01:45:07,820 --> 01:45:08,600
from objecting

6237
01:45:08,600 --> 01:45:10,040
to my occasional absence

6238
01:45:10,040 --> 01:45:11,420
on a Sunday, provided

6239
01:45:11,420 --> 01:45:11,840
that some

6240
01:45:11,840 --> 01:45:12,740
other clergyman

6241
01:45:12,740 --> 01:45:13,400
is engaged

6242
01:45:13,400 --> 01:45:13,740
to do

6243
01:45:13,740 --> 01:45:14,940
the duty of the day.

6244
01:45:15,920 --> 01:45:17,040
I remain, dear sir,

6245
01:45:17,040 --> 01:45:17,720
with respectful

6246
01:45:17,720 --> 01:45:18,300
compliments

6247
01:45:18,300 --> 01:45:18,840
to your lady

6248
01:45:18,840 --> 01:45:19,740
and daughters,

6249
01:45:19,740 --> 01:45:20,780
your well-wisher

6250
01:45:20,780 --> 01:45:21,980
and friend

6251
01:45:23,060 --> 01:45:23,460
William

6252
01:45:23,460 --> 01:45:24,660
Collins

6253
01:45:26,720 --> 01:45:27,560
at 4:00.

6254
01:45:27,560 --> 01:45:28,020
Therefore,

6255
01:45:28,020 --> 01:45:28,800
we may expect

6256
01:45:28,800 --> 01:45:29,720
this peacemaking

6257
01:45:29,720 --> 01:45:30,920
gentleman.

6258
01:45:31,460 --> 01:45:32,040
Said Mr.

6259
01:45:32,040 --> 01:45:33,140
Bennett, as he folded up

6260
01:45:33,140 --> 01:45:34,340
the letter.

6261
01:45:34,400 --> 01:45:35,120
He seems to be

6262
01:45:35,120 --> 01:45:36,320
a most conscientious

6263
01:45:36,320 --> 01:45:37,580
and polite young man

6264
01:45:37,580 --> 01:45:38,780
upon my word,

6265
01:45:38,900 --> 01:45:39,780
and I doubt not

6266
01:45:39,780 --> 01:45:40,200
will prove

6267
01:45:40,200 --> 01:45:41,400
a valuable acquaintance,

6268
01:45:41,700 --> 01:45:42,320
especially if

6269
01:45:42,320 --> 01:45:43,280
Lady Catherine

6270
01:45:43,280 --> 01:45:44,520
should be so indulgent

6271
01:45:44,520 --> 01:45:45,080
as to let him

6272
01:45:45,080 --> 01:45:46,280
come to us again.

6273
01:45:46,860 --> 01:45:47,940
There is some sense in.

6274
01:45:47,940 --> 01:45:48,360
What he says

6275
01:45:48,360 --> 01:45:49,220
about the girls.

6276
01:45:49,220 --> 01:45:50,040
However,

6277
01:45:50,040 --> 01:45:51,020
and if he is disposed

6278
01:45:51,020 --> 01:45:51,960
to make them any amends,

6279
01:45:51,960 --> 01:45:52,520
I shall not

6280
01:45:52,520 --> 01:45:53,040
be the person

6281
01:45:53,040 --> 01:45:54,240
to discourage him.

6282
01:45:54,680 --> 01:45:55,020
Though

6283
01:45:55,020 --> 01:45:56,220
it is difficult,

6284
01:45:56,360 --> 01:45:57,560
said Jane,

6285
01:45:57,560 --> 01:45:58,580
to guess in what way

6286
01:45:58,580 --> 01:45:58,980
he can mean

6287
01:45:58,980 --> 01:45:59,360
to make us

6288
01:45:59,360 --> 01:45:59,940
the atonement.

6289
01:45:59,940 --> 01:46:01,140
He thinks I do.

6290
01:46:01,320 --> 01:46:02,340
The wish is certainly,

6291
01:46:02,340 --> 01:46:03,540
to his credit.

6292
01:46:03,960 --> 01:46:04,680
Elizabeth was

6293
01:46:04,680 --> 01:46:05,480
chiefly struck

6294
01:46:05,480 --> 01:46:05,760
by his

6295
01:46:05,760 --> 01:46:06,980
extraordinary deference

6296
01:46:06,980 --> 01:46:08,180
for Lady Catherine

6297
01:46:08,180 --> 01:46:09,300
and his kind intention

6298
01:46:09,300 --> 01:46:10,800
of christening, marrying

6299
01:46:10,800 --> 01:46:11,520
and burying

6300
01:46:11,520 --> 01:46:12,240
his parishioners

6301
01:46:12,240 --> 01:46:12,780
whenever it were

6302
01:46:12,780 --> 01:46:13,980
required.

6303
01:46:14,180 --> 01:46:15,540
He must be an oddity,

6304
01:46:15,540 --> 01:46:16,400
I think.

6305
01:46:16,400 --> 01:46:17,420
Said she.

6306
01:46:17,420 --> 01:46:18,680
I can not make him out.

6307
01:46:19,100 --> 01:46:19,940
There is something very

6308
01:46:19,940 --> 01:46:21,420
pompous in his style.

6309
01:46:21,960 --> 01:46:23,180
And what can he mean

6310
01:46:23,180 --> 01:46:24,020
by apologizing

6311
01:46:24,020 --> 01:46:24,800
for being next

6312
01:46:24,800 --> 01:46:25,980
in the entail?

6313
01:46:25,980 --> 01:46:26,880
We cannot suppose

6314
01:46:26,880 --> 01:46:27,480
he would help it

6315
01:46:27,480 --> 01:46:28,680
if he could.

6316
01:46:28,680 --> 01:46:29,880
Could he be a sensible

6317
01:46:29,880 --> 01:46:31,080
man, sir?

6318
01:46:31,280 --> 01:46:32,060
No, my dear,

6319
01:46:32,060 --> 01:46:33,060
I think not.

6320
01:46:33,060 --> 01:46:33,960
I have great hopes of

6321
01:46:33,960 --> 01:46:34,460
finding him.

6322
01:46:34,460 --> 01:46:35,660
Quite the reverse.

6323
01:46:35,880 --> 01:46:36,680
There is a mixture

6324
01:46:36,680 --> 01:46:37,380
of civility

6325
01:46:37,380 --> 01:46:38,520
and self-importance

6326
01:46:38,520 --> 01:46:39,480
in his letter,

6327
01:46:39,480 --> 01:46:40,380
which promises.

6328
01:46:40,380 --> 01:46:41,300
Well,

6329
01:46:41,300 --> 01:46:42,120
I'm impatient

6330
01:46:42,120 --> 01:46:42,740
to see him.

6331
01:46:43,760 --> 01:46:44,420
In point of

6332
01:46:44,420 --> 01:46:45,840
composition, said.

6333
01:46:45,840 --> 01:46:46,500
Mary.

6334
01:46:46,500 --> 01:46:47,460
The letter does not

6335
01:46:47,460 --> 01:46:48,660
seem defective.

6336
01:46:48,680 --> 01:46:49,920
The idea of the olive

6337
01:46:49,920 --> 01:46:50,280
branch,

6338
01:46:50,280 --> 01:46:50,840
perhaps, is

6339
01:46:50,840 --> 01:46:52,020
not wholly new.

6340
01:46:52,020 --> 01:46:52,820
Yet think it is

6341
01:46:52,820 --> 01:46:54,020
well expressed.

6342
01:46:54,740 --> 01:46:56,000
To Catherine and Lydia.

6343
01:46:56,280 --> 01:46:57,360
Neither the letter nor

6344
01:46:57,360 --> 01:46:57,960
its writer

6345
01:46:57,960 --> 01:46:58,520
were in any

6346
01:46:58,520 --> 01:46:59,720
degree interesting.

6347
01:46:59,940 --> 01:47:00,620
It was next

6348
01:47:00,620 --> 01:47:01,380
to impossible

6349
01:47:01,380 --> 01:47:02,040
that their cousin

6350
01:47:02,040 --> 01:47:02,520
should come in

6351
01:47:02,520 --> 01:47:03,720
a scarlet coat.

6352
01:47:03,720 --> 01:47:04,340
And it was now.

6353
01:47:04,340 --> 01:47:04,940
Some weeks

6354
01:47:04,940 --> 01:47:05,700
since they had received

6355
01:47:05,700 --> 01:47:06,060
pleasure

6356
01:47:06,060 --> 01:47:06,840
from the society

6357
01:47:06,840 --> 01:47:07,280
of a man

6358
01:47:07,280 --> 01:47:08,480
in any other color.

6359
01:47:09,060 --> 01:47:10,560
As for their mother, Mr.

6360
01:47:10,560 --> 01:47:11,480
Collins, his letter

6361
01:47:11,480 --> 01:47:12,000
had done away

6362
01:47:12,000 --> 01:47:13,200
much of her ill will,

6363
01:47:13,400 --> 01:47:14,340
and she was preparing

6364
01:47:14,340 --> 01:47:14,840
to see him

6365
01:47:14,840 --> 01:47:15,260
with a degree

6366
01:47:15,260 --> 01:47:15,920
of composure

6367
01:47:15,920 --> 01:47:16,740
which astonished

6368
01:47:16,740 --> 01:47:17,400
her husband

6369
01:47:17,400 --> 01:47:18,600
and daughters.

6370
01:47:18,960 --> 01:47:19,320
Mr.

6371
01:47:19,320 --> 01:47:20,420
Collins was punctual

6372
01:47:20,420 --> 01:47:21,380
to his time

6373
01:47:21,380 --> 01:47:22,160
and was received

6374
01:47:22,160 --> 01:47:23,280
with great politeness

6375
01:47:23,280 --> 01:47:24,480
by the whole family.

6376
01:47:24,620 --> 01:47:24,980
Mr.

6377
01:47:24,980 --> 01:47:25,340
Bennett

6378
01:47:25,340 --> 01:47:26,540
indeed said little,

6379
01:47:26,660 --> 01:47:27,360
but the ladies

6380
01:47:27,360 --> 01:47:27,740
were ready

6381
01:47:27,740 --> 01:47:29,280
enough to talk, and Mr.

6382
01:47:29,280 --> 01:47:30,000
Collins seemed

6383
01:47:30,000 --> 01:47:30,360
neither

6384
01:47:30,360 --> 01:47:31,460
in need of encouragement

6385
01:47:31,460 --> 01:47:32,120
nor inclined

6386
01:47:32,120 --> 01:47:33,320
to be silent himself.

6387
01:47:33,780 --> 01:47:34,140
He was a.

6388
01:47:34,140 --> 01:47:34,920
Tall, heavy

6389
01:47:34,920 --> 01:47:35,420
looking young

6390
01:47:35,420 --> 01:47:36,660
man of five and 20.

6391
01:47:36,960 --> 01:47:37,460
His air

6392
01:47:37,460 --> 01:47:38,840
was grave and stately,

6393
01:47:39,060 --> 01:47:39,800
and his manners

6394
01:47:39,800 --> 01:47:41,000
were very formal.

6395
01:47:41,280 --> 01:47:42,200
He had not been long

6396
01:47:42,200 --> 01:47:42,800
seated before.

6397
01:47:42,800 --> 01:47:43,760
He complimented Mrs.

6398
01:47:43,760 --> 01:47:44,040
Bennett

6399
01:47:44,040 --> 01:47:45,000
on having so fine.

6400
01:47:45,000 --> 01:47:46,200
A family of daughters

6401
01:47:46,380 --> 01:47:47,240
said he had heard much

6402
01:47:47,240 --> 01:47:47,460
of their.

6403
01:47:47,460 --> 01:47:48,180
Beauty,

6404
01:47:48,180 --> 01:47:48,780
but that in

6405
01:47:48,780 --> 01:47:49,520
this instance.

6406
01:47:49,520 --> 01:47:50,760
Fame had fallen short

6407
01:47:50,760 --> 01:47:51,680
of the truth

6408
01:47:51,680 --> 01:47:52,380
and added

6409
01:47:52,380 --> 01:47:52,740
that he did

6410
01:47:52,740 --> 01:47:53,480
not doubt her

6411
01:47:53,480 --> 01:47:54,360
seeing them all in

6412
01:47:54,360 --> 01:47:55,640
due time disposed of

6413
01:47:55,640 --> 01:47:56,840
in marriage.

6414
01:47:56,880 --> 01:47:57,600
This gallantry

6415
01:47:57,600 --> 01:47:58,200
was not much

6416
01:47:58,200 --> 01:47:58,680
to the taste

6417
01:47:58,680 --> 01:47:59,840
of some of his hearers.

6418
01:47:59,840 --> 01:48:00,320
But Mrs.

6419
01:48:00,320 --> 01:48:00,840
Bennett,

6420
01:48:00,840 --> 01:48:01,400
who quarreled

6421
01:48:01,400 --> 01:48:02,600
with no compliments,

6422
01:48:02,600 --> 01:48:03,900
answered most readily.

6423
01:48:04,440 --> 01:48:06,020
You are very kind,

6424
01:48:06,020 --> 01:48:07,020
I am sure,

6425
01:48:07,020 --> 01:48:07,500
and I wish

6426
01:48:07,500 --> 01:48:08,520
with all my heart

6427
01:48:08,520 --> 01:48:09,720
it may prove so.

6428
01:48:09,840 --> 01:48:10,280
For else

6429
01:48:10,280 --> 01:48:11,160
they will be destitute

6430
01:48:11,160 --> 01:48:11,640
enough.

6431
01:48:11,640 --> 01:48:12,240
Things are

6432
01:48:12,240 --> 01:48:13,640
settled so oddly.

6433
01:48:14,700 --> 01:48:15,560
You allude perhaps

6434
01:48:15,560 --> 01:48:15,780
to the

6435
01:48:15,780 --> 01:48:16,980
entail of this estate.

6436
01:48:18,040 --> 01:48:18,800
Her, sir.

6437
01:48:18,800 --> 01:48:20,000
I do indeed.

6438
01:48:20,000 --> 01:48:21,240
It is a grievous affair

6439
01:48:21,240 --> 01:48:22,100
to my poor girls.

6440
01:48:22,100 --> 01:48:23,300
You must confess.

6441
01:48:23,760 --> 01:48:24,260
Not that

6442
01:48:24,260 --> 01:48:24,540
I mean

6443
01:48:24,540 --> 01:48:25,760
to find fault with you

6444
01:48:25,920 --> 01:48:26,600
for such things.

6445
01:48:26,600 --> 01:48:27,020
I know where

6446
01:48:27,020 --> 01:48:27,720
all chance

6447
01:48:27,720 --> 01:48:28,680
in this world.

6448
01:48:28,680 --> 01:48:29,640
There is no knowing

6449
01:48:29,640 --> 01:48:30,560
how states will go.

6450
01:48:30,560 --> 01:48:31,280
And once they come

6451
01:48:31,280 --> 01:48:32,480
to be entailed.

6452
01:48:33,180 --> 01:48:34,080
I am very sensible,

6453
01:48:34,080 --> 01:48:35,100
madam, of the hardship

6454
01:48:35,100 --> 01:48:36,300
to my fair cousins,

6455
01:48:37,080 --> 01:48:37,800
and could say

6456
01:48:37,800 --> 01:48:39,000
much on the subject.

6457
01:48:39,060 --> 01:48:40,220
But that I am cautious

6458
01:48:40,220 --> 01:48:40,700
of appearing

6459
01:48:40,700 --> 01:48:42,040
forward and precipitate.

6460
01:48:43,220 --> 01:48:44,000
But I can assure

6461
01:48:44,000 --> 01:48:44,840
the young ladies

6462
01:48:44,840 --> 01:48:45,740
that I come prepared

6463
01:48:45,740 --> 01:48:46,940
to admire them.

6464
01:48:47,640 --> 01:48:48,260
At present

6465
01:48:48,260 --> 01:48:49,460
I will not say more, but

6466
01:48:49,560 --> 01:48:50,520
perhaps when we are

6467
01:48:50,520 --> 01:48:51,720
better acquainted.

6468
01:48:52,520 --> 01:48:53,400
He was interrupted

6469
01:48:53,400 --> 01:48:54,600
by a summons to dinner

6470
01:48:54,720 --> 01:48:55,400
and the girls

6471
01:48:55,400 --> 01:48:56,600
smiled on each other.

6472
01:48:56,900 --> 01:48:57,620
They were not the.

6473
01:48:57,620 --> 01:48:58,880
Only objects of Mr.

6474
01:48:58,880 --> 01:49:00,120
Collins's admiration.

6475
01:49:00,440 --> 01:49:01,080
The hall,

6476
01:49:01,080 --> 01:49:01,800
the dining room

6477
01:49:01,800 --> 01:49:03,000
and all its furniture

6478
01:49:03,000 --> 01:49:03,780
were examined

6479
01:49:03,780 --> 01:49:04,820
and praised,

6480
01:49:04,820 --> 01:49:05,960
and his commendation

6481
01:49:05,960 --> 01:49:06,560
of everything

6482
01:49:06,560 --> 01:49:07,460
would have touched Mrs.

6483
01:49:07,460 --> 01:49:08,460
Bennett's heart.

6484
01:49:08,460 --> 01:49:09,560
But for the mortifying.

6485
01:49:09,560 --> 01:49:10,380
Supposition of his

6486
01:49:10,380 --> 01:49:11,040
viewing it all

6487
01:49:11,040 --> 01:49:11,480
as his own

6488
01:49:11,480 --> 01:49:12,680
future property.

6489
01:49:12,860 --> 01:49:13,680
The dinner, too,

6490
01:49:13,680 --> 01:49:14,240
in its turn,

6491
01:49:14,240 --> 01:49:15,440
was highly admired.

6492
01:49:15,500 --> 01:49:16,080
And he begged

6493
01:49:16,080 --> 01:49:16,560
to know, too,

6494
01:49:16,560 --> 01:49:17,460
which of his fair

6495
01:49:17,460 --> 01:49:18,660
cousins, The Excellency.

6496
01:49:18,660 --> 01:49:19,500
Of its cooking was.

6497
01:49:19,500 --> 01:49:20,400
Own.

6498
01:49:20,400 --> 01:49:21,180
But he was sat

6499
01:49:21,180 --> 01:49:22,160
right there by Mrs.

6500
01:49:22,160 --> 01:49:23,540
Bennett, who assured him

6501
01:49:23,540 --> 01:49:24,480
with some disparity

6502
01:49:24,480 --> 01:49:25,260
that they were very well

6503
01:49:25,260 --> 01:49:25,620
able to.

6504
01:49:25,620 --> 01:49:26,640
Keep a good cook

6505
01:49:26,640 --> 01:49:27,080
and that her

6506
01:49:27,080 --> 01:49:27,620
daughters had.

6507
01:49:27,620 --> 01:49:28,260
Nothing to do

6508
01:49:28,260 --> 01:49:29,300
in the kitchen.

6509
01:49:29,300 --> 01:49:30,200
He begged pardon

6510
01:49:30,200 --> 01:49:30,620
for having

6511
01:49:30,620 --> 01:49:31,800
displeased her.

6512
01:49:31,800 --> 01:49:32,880
In a softened tone,

6513
01:49:32,880 --> 01:49:33,660
she declared herself

6514
01:49:33,660 --> 01:49:34,860
not at all offended.

6515
01:49:34,980 --> 01:49:35,900
But he continued to.

6516
01:49:35,900 --> 01:49:36,780
Apologize for

6517
01:49:36,780 --> 01:49:37,500
about a quarter

6518
01:49:37,500 --> 01:49:38,180
of an hour.

6519
01:49:41,600 --> 01:49:42,800
Chapter 14.

6520
01:49:44,000 --> 01:49:44,900
During dinner, Mr.

6521
01:49:44,900 --> 01:49:45,680
Bennett scarcely

6522
01:49:45,680 --> 01:49:46,620
spoke at all.

6523
01:49:46,620 --> 01:49:47,460
But when the servants

6524
01:49:47,460 --> 01:49:48,300
were withdrawn,

6525
01:49:48,300 --> 01:49:49,200
he thought it time

6526
01:49:49,200 --> 01:49:49,460
to have

6527
01:49:49,460 --> 01:49:50,340
some conversation

6528
01:49:50,340 --> 01:49:51,380
with his guest

6529
01:49:51,380 --> 01:49:52,440
and therefore started

6530
01:49:52,440 --> 01:49:52,980
a subject

6531
01:49:52,980 --> 01:49:53,960
in which he expected him

6532
01:49:53,960 --> 01:49:54,800
to shine.

6533
01:49:54,800 --> 01:49:55,580
By observing that,

6534
01:49:55,580 --> 01:49:56,780
he seemed very fortunate

6535
01:49:56,780 --> 01:49:57,980
in his patroness,

6536
01:49:58,040 --> 01:49:58,800
Lady Catherine,

6537
01:49:58,800 --> 01:49:59,300
to Berg's

6538
01:49:59,300 --> 01:50:00,500
attention to his wishes

6539
01:50:00,680 --> 01:50:01,520
and consideration

6540
01:50:01,520 --> 01:50:03,000
for his comfort appeared

6541
01:50:03,000 --> 01:50:04,200
very remarkable.

6542
01:50:04,500 --> 01:50:04,860
Mr.

6543
01:50:04,860 --> 01:50:05,600
Bennett could not have

6544
01:50:05,600 --> 01:50:06,800
chosen better.

6545
01:50:06,800 --> 01:50:07,160
Mr.

6546
01:50:07,160 --> 01:50:08,420
Collins was eloquent

6547
01:50:08,420 --> 01:50:09,600
in her praise.

6548
01:50:09,600 --> 01:50:11,000
The subject elevated him

6549
01:50:11,000 --> 01:50:11,340
to more

6550
01:50:11,340 --> 01:50:11,940
than usual

6551
01:50:11,940 --> 01:50:13,140
solemnity of manner,

6552
01:50:13,260 --> 01:50:13,920
and with the most

6553
01:50:13,920 --> 01:50:15,020
important aspect.

6554
01:50:15,020 --> 01:50:16,220
He protested that.

6555
01:50:16,500 --> 01:50:17,300
He had never

6556
01:50:17,300 --> 01:50:17,880
in his life

6557
01:50:17,880 --> 01:50:19,560
witnessed such behavior

6558
01:50:19,560 --> 01:50:20,660
in a person of rank,

6559
01:50:20,660 --> 01:50:22,320
such affability

6560
01:50:22,320 --> 01:50:23,820
and condescension,

6561
01:50:24,060 --> 01:50:25,040
as he had himself

6562
01:50:25,040 --> 01:50:25,860
experienced

6563
01:50:25,860 --> 01:50:27,060
from Lady Catherine.

6564
01:50:27,120 --> 01:50:28,520
She had been graciously

6565
01:50:28,520 --> 01:50:29,460
pleased to approve of

6566
01:50:29,460 --> 01:50:30,720
both of the discourses

6567
01:50:30,720 --> 01:50:31,460
which she had already

6568
01:50:31,460 --> 01:50:32,040
had the honor

6569
01:50:32,040 --> 01:50:33,260
of preaching before her.

6570
01:50:33,800 --> 01:50:34,860
She had also asked him

6571
01:50:34,860 --> 01:50:36,640
twice to dine at roses

6572
01:50:36,920 --> 01:50:37,860
and had sent for him

6573
01:50:37,860 --> 01:50:38,660
only the Saturday

6574
01:50:38,660 --> 01:50:39,320
before to make

6575
01:50:39,320 --> 01:50:40,460
up her pool of cordial

6576
01:50:40,460 --> 01:50:41,660
in the evening.

6577
01:50:41,760 --> 01:50:42,420
Lady Catherine

6578
01:50:42,420 --> 01:50:42,980
was reckoned

6579
01:50:42,980 --> 01:50:44,240
proud by many people

6580
01:50:44,240 --> 01:50:44,760
he knew,

6581
01:50:44,760 --> 01:50:45,440
but he had

6582
01:50:45,440 --> 01:50:46,640
never seen anything but

6583
01:50:46,940 --> 01:50:47,720
in her.

6584
01:50:47,720 --> 01:50:48,960
She had always

6585
01:50:48,960 --> 01:50:49,680
spoken to him

6586
01:50:49,680 --> 01:50:50,100
as she would

6587
01:50:50,100 --> 01:50:51,300
to any other gentleman.

6588
01:50:51,360 --> 01:50:52,080
She made not

6589
01:50:52,080 --> 01:50:52,940
the smallest

6590
01:50:52,940 --> 01:50:53,660
objection to.

6591
01:50:53,660 --> 01:50:54,180
His joining

6592
01:50:54,180 --> 01:50:54,840
in the society.

6593
01:50:54,840 --> 01:50:55,740
Of the neighborhood,

6594
01:50:55,740 --> 01:50:56,240
nor to his

6595
01:50:56,240 --> 01:50:57,000
leaving the parish

6596
01:50:57,000 --> 01:50:58,020
occasionally for a week

6597
01:50:58,020 --> 01:50:58,520
or two

6598
01:50:58,520 --> 01:50:59,760
to visit his relations.

6599
01:51:00,140 --> 01:51:00,600
She had

6600
01:51:00,600 --> 01:51:01,640
even condescended

6601
01:51:01,640 --> 01:51:02,940
to advise him to marry

6602
01:51:02,940 --> 01:51:03,920
as soon as he could.

6603
01:51:03,920 --> 01:51:04,500
Provided

6604
01:51:04,500 --> 01:51:05,820
he chose with discretion

6605
01:51:06,140 --> 01:51:06,800
and had once

6606
01:51:06,800 --> 01:51:07,640
paid him a visit

6607
01:51:07,640 --> 01:51:08,840
in his humble parsonage,

6608
01:51:09,060 --> 01:51:09,500
where she had

6609
01:51:09,500 --> 01:51:10,440
perfectly approved

6610
01:51:10,440 --> 01:51:11,520
all the alterations

6611
01:51:11,520 --> 01:51:12,840
he had been making and

6612
01:51:12,840 --> 01:51:13,860
had even vouchsafed

6613
01:51:13,860 --> 01:51:15,180
to suggest some herself

6614
01:51:15,480 --> 01:51:16,860
some shelves

6615
01:51:16,860 --> 01:51:18,120
in the closet upstairs.

6616
01:51:18,920 --> 01:51:19,620
That is all

6617
01:51:19,620 --> 01:51:20,640
very proper and civil,

6618
01:51:20,640 --> 01:51:22,320
I am sure, said Mrs.

6619
01:51:22,320 --> 01:51:23,940
Bennett, and I daresay

6620
01:51:23,940 --> 01:51:24,440
she is a very

6621
01:51:24,440 --> 01:51:25,640
agreeable woman.

6622
01:51:25,640 --> 01:51:26,540
It is a pity

6623
01:51:26,540 --> 01:51:26,940
that great

6624
01:51:26,940 --> 01:51:27,680
ladies in general

6625
01:51:27,680 --> 01:51:28,880
are not more like her.

6626
01:51:29,240 --> 01:51:30,080
Does she live near

6627
01:51:30,080 --> 01:51:30,600
you, sir?

6628
01:51:31,860 --> 01:51:32,400
The garden

6629
01:51:32,400 --> 01:51:33,200
in which stands my

6630
01:51:33,200 --> 01:51:33,860
humble abode,

6631
01:51:33,860 --> 01:51:34,640
is separated

6632
01:51:34,640 --> 01:51:35,920
only by Lane from Rose

6633
01:51:35,920 --> 01:51:37,120
Kings Park.

6634
01:51:37,440 --> 01:51:38,160
Her lady ships

6635
01:51:38,160 --> 01:51:39,360
residence.

6636
01:51:39,780 --> 01:51:40,400
I think you said

6637
01:51:40,400 --> 01:51:41,600
she was a widow, sir.

6638
01:51:41,780 --> 01:51:42,020
How?

6639
01:51:42,020 --> 01:51:43,220
She and her family.

6640
01:51:43,380 --> 01:51:44,000
She has one

6641
01:51:44,000 --> 01:51:44,760
only daughter,

6642
01:51:44,760 --> 01:51:45,920
the heir of Rose Ings,

6643
01:51:45,920 --> 01:51:47,120
and a very extensive

6644
01:51:47,120 --> 01:51:48,320
property.

6645
01:51:48,360 --> 01:51:49,740
Oh, said Mrs.

6646
01:51:49,740 --> 01:51:50,100
Bennett,

6647
01:51:50,100 --> 01:51:51,260
shaking her head.

6648
01:51:51,260 --> 01:51:52,160
Then she is better off

6649
01:51:52,160 --> 01:51:53,360
than many girls.

6650
01:51:53,460 --> 01:51:54,660
And what sort

6651
01:51:54,660 --> 01:51:55,760
young lady is she?

6652
01:51:55,760 --> 01:51:56,960
Is she handsome?

6653
01:51:57,620 --> 01:51:58,520
She is a most charming

6654
01:51:58,520 --> 01:51:58,980
young lady.

6655
01:51:58,980 --> 01:52:00,180
Indeed.

6656
01:52:00,360 --> 01:52:01,460
Lady Catherine herself

6657
01:52:01,460 --> 01:52:01,880
says that

6658
01:52:01,880 --> 01:52:02,780
in point of true

6659
01:52:02,780 --> 01:52:04,160
beauty, Mr.

6660
01:52:04,160 --> 01:52:04,760
Borg far

6661
01:52:04,760 --> 01:52:05,240
superior

6662
01:52:05,240 --> 01:52:06,000
to the handsomest

6663
01:52:06,000 --> 01:52:07,200
of her sex.

6664
01:52:07,620 --> 01:52:08,240
Because there is

6665
01:52:08,240 --> 01:52:09,240
that in her features,

6666
01:52:09,240 --> 01:52:09,740
which marks

6667
01:52:09,740 --> 01:52:10,380
the young woman

6668
01:52:10,380 --> 01:52:11,640
of distinguished birth.

6669
01:52:13,380 --> 01:52:14,460
She is unfortunately,

6670
01:52:14,460 --> 01:52:15,980
of a sickly constitution

6671
01:52:16,920 --> 01:52:17,880
which has prevented her

6672
01:52:17,880 --> 01:52:18,860
making that progress

6673
01:52:18,860 --> 01:52:20,060
in many accomplishments

6674
01:52:20,400 --> 01:52:21,180
which she could not

6675
01:52:21,180 --> 01:52:21,740
otherwise have

6676
01:52:21,740 --> 01:52:22,760
failed of.

6677
01:52:22,760 --> 01:52:23,700
As I am informed

6678
01:52:23,700 --> 01:52:24,540
by the lady

6679
01:52:24,540 --> 01:52:25,500
who superintended

6680
01:52:25,500 --> 01:52:27,140
her education and

6681
01:52:27,140 --> 01:52:27,620
who still

6682
01:52:27,620 --> 01:52:28,520
resides with them.

6683
01:52:30,120 --> 01:52:31,100
But she is perfectly

6684
01:52:31,100 --> 01:52:32,220
amiable and often

6685
01:52:32,220 --> 01:52:32,820
condescended

6686
01:52:32,820 --> 01:52:33,240
to drive

6687
01:52:33,240 --> 01:52:33,860
by my humble

6688
01:52:33,860 --> 01:52:34,220
abode

6689
01:52:34,220 --> 01:52:35,060
in her little phaeton

6690
01:52:35,060 --> 01:52:36,260
and ponies.

6691
01:52:37,740 --> 01:52:38,940
Has she been presented?

6692
01:52:39,260 --> 01:52:39,740
I do not

6693
01:52:39,740 --> 01:52:40,440
remember her name

6694
01:52:40,440 --> 01:52:41,000
among the ladies

6695
01:52:41,000 --> 01:52:42,200
at court.

6696
01:52:42,660 --> 01:52:43,280
Her indifferent

6697
01:52:43,280 --> 01:52:44,480
state of health

6698
01:52:44,720 --> 01:52:45,240
prevents her

6699
01:52:45,240 --> 01:52:46,440
being in town.

6700
01:52:46,800 --> 01:52:47,880
And by that means,

6701
01:52:47,880 --> 01:52:48,680
as I told Lady

6702
01:52:48,680 --> 01:52:49,560
Catherine myself,

6703
01:52:49,560 --> 01:52:50,900
one day has deprived

6704
01:52:50,900 --> 01:52:51,560
the British court

6705
01:52:51,560 --> 01:52:51,800
of its

6706
01:52:51,800 --> 01:52:53,000
brightest ornament.

6707
01:52:53,400 --> 01:52:54,320
Her Ladyship

6708
01:52:54,320 --> 01:52:55,520
pleased with the idea.

6709
01:52:55,860 --> 01:52:56,900
And you may imagine that

6710
01:52:56,900 --> 01:52:57,360
I am happy

6711
01:52:57,360 --> 01:52:58,220
on every occasion

6712
01:52:58,220 --> 01:52:58,680
to offer

6713
01:52:58,680 --> 01:52:59,180
those little

6714
01:52:59,180 --> 01:53:00,300
delicate compliments

6715
01:53:00,300 --> 01:53:00,600
which are

6716
01:53:00,600 --> 01:53:01,520
always acceptable

6717
01:53:01,520 --> 01:53:02,720
to ladies.

6718
01:53:03,380 --> 01:53:04,260
I have more than once

6719
01:53:04,260 --> 01:53:04,640
observed

6720
01:53:04,640 --> 01:53:05,840
to Lady Catherine

6721
01:53:05,880 --> 01:53:06,180
that her

6722
01:53:06,180 --> 01:53:07,100
charming daughter

6723
01:53:07,100 --> 01:53:07,800
seemed born

6724
01:53:07,800 --> 01:53:09,000
to be a duchess

6725
01:53:09,720 --> 01:53:10,640
and that the most

6726
01:53:10,640 --> 01:53:11,840
elevated rank,

6727
01:53:11,940 --> 01:53:12,780
instead of giving her

6728
01:53:12,780 --> 01:53:13,880
consequence

6729
01:53:13,880 --> 01:53:15,480
would be adorned by her.

6730
01:53:16,280 --> 01:53:17,060
These are

6731
01:53:17,060 --> 01:53:17,540
the kind of

6732
01:53:17,540 --> 01:53:18,120
little things

6733
01:53:18,120 --> 01:53:18,560
which please

6734
01:53:18,560 --> 01:53:19,620
her ladyship,

6735
01:53:19,620 --> 01:53:20,400
and it is the sort

6736
01:53:20,400 --> 01:53:21,060
of attention

6737
01:53:21,060 --> 01:53:22,200
which I conceive myself

6738
01:53:22,200 --> 01:53:23,820
peculiarly bound to pay.

6739
01:53:25,440 --> 01:53:26,960
You judge very properly.

6740
01:53:27,300 --> 01:53:27,780
Said Mr.

6741
01:53:27,780 --> 01:53:28,580
Bennett.

6742
01:53:28,580 --> 01:53:30,180
And it is happy for you

6743
01:53:30,300 --> 01:53:31,080
that you possess

6744
01:53:31,080 --> 01:53:32,540
the talent of flattering

6745
01:53:32,540 --> 01:53:33,740
with delicacy.

6746
01:53:33,920 --> 01:53:35,060
May I ask whether

6747
01:53:35,060 --> 01:53:35,780
these pleasing

6748
01:53:35,780 --> 01:53:36,860
attentions proceed

6749
01:53:36,860 --> 01:53:37,160
from the

6750
01:53:37,160 --> 01:53:38,360
impulse of the moment,

6751
01:53:38,460 --> 01:53:39,840
or are the result

6752
01:53:39,840 --> 01:53:41,040
of previous study?

6753
01:53:41,760 --> 01:53:42,360
They arise

6754
01:53:42,360 --> 01:53:43,020
chiefly from

6755
01:53:43,020 --> 01:53:43,700
what is passing

6756
01:53:43,700 --> 01:53:44,900
at the time.

6757
01:53:45,080 --> 01:53:45,540
And though I

6758
01:53:45,540 --> 01:53:46,700
sometimes amuse myself

6759
01:53:46,700 --> 01:53:47,340
with suggesting

6760
01:53:47,340 --> 01:53:47,960
and arranging

6761
01:53:47,960 --> 01:53:48,500
such little

6762
01:53:48,500 --> 01:53:49,500
elegant compliments

6763
01:53:49,500 --> 01:53:49,860
as may be

6764
01:53:49,860 --> 01:53:50,400
adapted to

6765
01:53:50,400 --> 01:53:51,600
ordinary occasions,

6766
01:53:52,400 --> 01:53:53,180
I always wish

6767
01:53:53,180 --> 01:53:53,840
to give them

6768
01:53:53,840 --> 01:53:55,340
as unstudied an error

6769
01:53:55,340 --> 01:53:56,540
as possible.

6770
01:53:57,600 --> 01:53:57,960
Mr.

6771
01:53:57,960 --> 01:53:59,160
Bennett's expectations

6772
01:53:59,160 --> 01:54:00,360
were fully answered.

6773
01:54:00,680 --> 01:54:02,160
His cousin was as absurd

6774
01:54:02,160 --> 01:54:03,120
as he had hoped.

6775
01:54:03,120 --> 01:54:03,720
And he listened.

6776
01:54:03,720 --> 01:54:04,040
To him

6777
01:54:04,040 --> 01:54:04,260
with the

6778
01:54:04,260 --> 01:54:05,460
keenest enjoyment,

6779
01:54:05,600 --> 01:54:06,240
maintaining,

6780
01:54:06,240 --> 01:54:06,980
at the same time

6781
01:54:06,980 --> 01:54:07,760
the most resolute

6782
01:54:07,760 --> 01:54:08,280
composure

6783
01:54:08,280 --> 01:54:09,920
of countenance, and

6784
01:54:10,020 --> 01:54:10,820
except in an

6785
01:54:10,820 --> 01:54:11,660
occasional glance

6786
01:54:11,660 --> 01:54:13,160
at Elizabeth requiring

6787
01:54:13,160 --> 01:54:13,980
no partner

6788
01:54:13,980 --> 01:54:15,180
in his pleasure.

6789
01:54:15,180 --> 01:54:16,040
By teatime.

6790
01:54:16,040 --> 01:54:16,440
However,

6791
01:54:16,440 --> 01:54:16,860
the dose

6792
01:54:16,860 --> 01:54:18,140
had been enough, and Mr.

6793
01:54:18,140 --> 01:54:18,440
Bennett

6794
01:54:18,440 --> 01:54:19,200
was glad to take

6795
01:54:19,200 --> 01:54:19,640
his guest

6796
01:54:19,640 --> 01:54:20,300
into the drawing

6797
01:54:20,300 --> 01:54:21,060
room again.

6798
01:54:21,060 --> 01:54:22,260
And when he was over,

6799
01:54:22,340 --> 01:54:23,300
glad to invite him

6800
01:54:23,300 --> 01:54:24,020
to read aloud

6801
01:54:24,020 --> 01:54:25,160
to the ladies.

6802
01:54:25,160 --> 01:54:25,500
Mr.

6803
01:54:25,500 --> 01:54:26,280
Collins readily

6804
01:54:26,280 --> 01:54:27,060
assented.

6805
01:54:27,060 --> 01:54:28,320
And a book was produced.

6806
01:54:28,740 --> 01:54:29,820
But on beholding.

6807
01:54:29,820 --> 01:54:30,740
It for everything,

6808
01:54:30,740 --> 01:54:31,200
announced it

6809
01:54:31,200 --> 01:54:31,440
to be

6810
01:54:31,440 --> 01:54:31,620
from the

6811
01:54:31,620 --> 01:54:32,820
circulating library.

6812
01:54:33,080 --> 01:54:34,280
He started back

6813
01:54:34,340 --> 01:54:35,640
and begging pardon,

6814
01:54:35,820 --> 01:54:36,500
protested that

6815
01:54:36,500 --> 01:54:38,240
he never read novels.

6816
01:54:38,640 --> 01:54:39,900
Kitty stared at him.

6817
01:54:40,080 --> 01:54:41,460
And Lydia exclaimed.

6818
01:54:41,900 --> 01:54:42,540
Other books

6819
01:54:42,540 --> 01:54:43,380
were produced.

6820
01:54:43,380 --> 01:54:43,820
And after

6821
01:54:43,820 --> 01:54:44,720
some deliberation,

6822
01:54:44,720 --> 01:54:45,200
he chose

6823
01:54:45,200 --> 01:54:46,400
for Dice's sermons.

6824
01:54:46,740 --> 01:54:47,660
Lydia gaped

6825
01:54:47,660 --> 01:54:48,860
as he opened the volume,

6826
01:54:49,080 --> 01:54:50,120
and before he had,

6827
01:54:50,120 --> 01:54:51,080
with very monotonous

6828
01:54:51,080 --> 01:54:51,920
solemnity, read

6829
01:54:51,920 --> 01:54:52,980
three pages.

6830
01:54:52,980 --> 01:54:53,880
She interrupted him.

6831
01:54:53,880 --> 01:54:55,200
With, Do you know

6832
01:54:55,200 --> 01:54:55,740
the law

6833
01:54:55,740 --> 01:54:56,720
that my Uncle Philips

6834
01:54:56,720 --> 01:54:57,180
talks of

6835
01:54:57,180 --> 01:54:58,380
turning away Richard?

6836
01:54:58,380 --> 01:54:59,180
And if he does

6837
01:54:59,180 --> 01:54:59,840
kind of forced

6838
01:54:59,840 --> 01:55:00,860
it will hire him.

6839
01:55:00,860 --> 01:55:01,880
My aunt told me

6840
01:55:01,880 --> 01:55:03,080
so herself on.

6841
01:55:03,320 --> 01:55:03,980
I shall walk to

6842
01:55:03,980 --> 01:55:04,740
merit in tomorrow

6843
01:55:04,740 --> 01:55:05,840
to hear more about it

6844
01:55:05,840 --> 01:55:06,800
and to ask when Mr.

6845
01:55:06,800 --> 01:55:07,460
Denny comes back

6846
01:55:07,460 --> 01:55:08,660
from town.

6847
01:55:08,960 --> 01:55:09,980
Lydia was bid by her

6848
01:55:09,980 --> 01:55:10,980
two eldest sisters

6849
01:55:10,980 --> 01:55:12,060
to hold her tongue.

6850
01:55:12,060 --> 01:55:12,500
But Mr.

6851
01:55:12,500 --> 01:55:13,980
Collins much offended,

6852
01:55:14,180 --> 01:55:15,360
laid aside his book

6853
01:55:15,360 --> 01:55:15,860
and said.

6854
01:55:17,280 --> 01:55:17,900
I have often

6855
01:55:17,900 --> 01:55:18,480
observed how

6856
01:55:18,480 --> 01:55:19,280
little young ladies

6857
01:55:19,280 --> 01:55:19,860
are interested

6858
01:55:19,860 --> 01:55:20,280
by books

6859
01:55:20,280 --> 01:55:21,480
of a serious stamp.

6860
01:55:21,920 --> 01:55:22,760
Though Written solely

6861
01:55:22,760 --> 01:55:23,960
for their benefit.

6862
01:55:24,360 --> 01:55:25,160
It amazes

6863
01:55:25,160 --> 01:55:26,360
me, I confess.

6864
01:55:26,420 --> 01:55:26,960
For certainly

6865
01:55:26,960 --> 01:55:27,680
there can be nothing

6866
01:55:27,680 --> 01:55:28,560
so advantageous

6867
01:55:28,560 --> 01:55:29,760
to them as instruction.

6868
01:55:30,920 --> 01:55:31,560
But I will no

6869
01:55:31,560 --> 01:55:32,360
longer important

6870
01:55:32,360 --> 01:55:33,560
in my young cousin.

6871
01:55:34,020 --> 01:55:35,460
Then turning to Mr.

6872
01:55:35,460 --> 01:55:36,060
Bennett,

6873
01:55:36,060 --> 01:55:37,020
he offered himself

6874
01:55:37,020 --> 01:55:38,040
as his antagonist

6875
01:55:38,040 --> 01:55:39,240
at backgammon.

6876
01:55:39,240 --> 01:55:39,600
Mr.

6877
01:55:39,600 --> 01:55:40,320
Bennett accepted

6878
01:55:40,320 --> 01:55:41,520
the challenge, observing

6879
01:55:41,520 --> 01:55:42,120
that he acted

6880
01:55:42,120 --> 01:55:43,020
very wisely

6881
01:55:43,020 --> 01:55:43,860
and leaving the girls

6882
01:55:43,860 --> 01:55:44,300
to their own

6883
01:55:44,300 --> 01:55:45,500
trifling amusements.

6884
01:55:45,840 --> 01:55:46,220
Mrs.

6885
01:55:46,220 --> 01:55:46,580
Bennett

6886
01:55:46,580 --> 01:55:47,220
and her daughters

6887
01:55:47,220 --> 01:55:48,600
apologized most severely

6888
01:55:48,600 --> 01:55:49,800
for Lydia's interruption

6889
01:55:50,000 --> 01:55:50,600
and promised

6890
01:55:50,600 --> 01:55:50,960
that it should

6891
01:55:50,960 --> 01:55:52,100
not occur again.

6892
01:55:52,100 --> 01:55:52,620
If he would

6893
01:55:52,620 --> 01:55:53,820
resume his book.

6894
01:55:53,820 --> 01:55:54,300
But Mr.

6895
01:55:54,300 --> 01:55:54,920
Collins,

6896
01:55:54,920 --> 01:55:56,040
after assuring them

6897
01:55:56,040 --> 01:55:56,480
that he bore

6898
01:55:56,480 --> 01:55:57,180
his young cousin

6899
01:55:57,180 --> 01:55:58,080
no ill will

6900
01:55:58,080 --> 01:55:58,700
and should never

6901
01:55:58,700 --> 01:55:59,580
resent her behavior

6902
01:55:59,580 --> 01:56:00,660
as any affront,

6903
01:56:00,660 --> 01:56:01,340
seated himself

6904
01:56:01,340 --> 01:56:02,000
at another table

6905
01:56:02,000 --> 01:56:02,400
with Mr.

6906
01:56:02,400 --> 01:56:03,200
Bennett and

6907
01:56:03,200 --> 01:56:04,520
prepared for backgammon.

6908
01:56:05,880 --> 01:56:07,080
Chapter 15.

6909
01:56:08,300 --> 01:56:08,600
Mr.

6910
01:56:08,600 --> 01:56:09,200
Collins was

6911
01:56:09,200 --> 01:56:10,560
not a sensible man,

6912
01:56:10,860 --> 01:56:11,780
and the deficiency

6913
01:56:11,780 --> 01:56:12,720
of nature had been

6914
01:56:12,720 --> 01:56:13,200
but little

6915
01:56:13,200 --> 01:56:14,460
assisted by education

6916
01:56:14,460 --> 01:56:15,660
or society.

6917
01:56:15,660 --> 01:56:16,560
The greatest part of

6918
01:56:16,560 --> 01:56:17,000
his life,

6919
01:56:17,000 --> 01:56:17,780
having been spent

6920
01:56:17,780 --> 01:56:18,600
under the guidance

6921
01:56:18,600 --> 01:56:19,380
of an illiterate

6922
01:56:19,380 --> 01:56:20,660
and miserly father.

6923
01:56:21,120 --> 01:56:22,080
And though belonged

6924
01:56:22,080 --> 01:56:22,340
to one

6925
01:56:22,340 --> 01:56:23,540
of the universities,

6926
01:56:23,580 --> 01:56:24,500
he had merely kept

6927
01:56:24,500 --> 01:56:25,700
the necessary terms

6928
01:56:25,880 --> 01:56:27,000
without forming at it

6929
01:56:27,000 --> 01:56:28,460
any useful acquaintance.

6930
01:56:28,980 --> 01:56:30,020
The subjection in which

6931
01:56:30,020 --> 01:56:30,540
his father

6932
01:56:30,540 --> 01:56:31,500
had brought him up

6933
01:56:31,500 --> 01:56:32,660
had given him originally

6934
01:56:32,660 --> 01:56:33,500
great humility

6935
01:56:33,500 --> 01:56:34,460
of manner.

6936
01:56:34,460 --> 01:56:35,780
But it was now a good

6937
01:56:35,780 --> 01:56:36,980
deal counteracted

6938
01:56:37,200 --> 01:56:37,860
by the self

6939
01:56:37,860 --> 01:56:39,380
conceit of a weak head

6940
01:56:39,600 --> 01:56:40,800
living in retirement

6941
01:56:40,920 --> 01:56:41,220
and the

6942
01:56:41,220 --> 01:56:42,420
consequential feelings

6943
01:56:42,420 --> 01:56:43,880
of early and unexpected

6944
01:56:43,880 --> 01:56:45,080
prosperity.

6945
01:56:45,240 --> 01:56:46,380
A fortunate chance

6946
01:56:46,380 --> 01:56:47,160
had recommended him

6947
01:56:47,160 --> 01:56:47,520
to Lady

6948
01:56:47,520 --> 01:56:48,380
Catherine de Burg

6949
01:56:48,380 --> 01:56:48,900
when the living

6950
01:56:48,900 --> 01:56:49,460
of Hansford

6951
01:56:49,460 --> 01:56:50,640
was vacant and.

6952
01:56:50,640 --> 01:56:51,260
The respect

6953
01:56:51,260 --> 01:56:52,160
which he felt for her

6954
01:56:52,160 --> 01:56:52,940
high rank

6955
01:56:52,940 --> 01:56:53,900
and his veneration

6956
01:56:53,900 --> 01:56:54,360
for her

6957
01:56:54,360 --> 01:56:55,560
as his patroness,

6958
01:56:55,560 --> 01:56:56,100
mingling

6959
01:56:56,100 --> 01:56:57,000
with a very good opinion

6960
01:56:57,000 --> 01:56:57,860
of himself,

6961
01:56:57,860 --> 01:56:58,640
of his authority

6962
01:56:58,640 --> 01:56:59,580
as a clergyman,

6963
01:56:59,580 --> 01:57:00,300
and his right

6964
01:57:00,300 --> 01:57:01,320
as, a rector.

6965
01:57:01,320 --> 01:57:01,620
Made.

6966
01:57:01,620 --> 01:57:02,340
Him altogether

6967
01:57:02,340 --> 01:57:03,440
a mixture of pride

6968
01:57:03,440 --> 01:57:04,640
and obsequiousness,

6969
01:57:04,740 --> 01:57:05,880
self-importance

6970
01:57:05,880 --> 01:57:07,080
and humility.

6971
01:57:07,500 --> 01:57:08,840
Having now a good house

6972
01:57:08,840 --> 01:57:09,240
and a very

6973
01:57:09,240 --> 01:57:10,400
sufficient income,

6974
01:57:10,400 --> 01:57:11,840
he intended to marry

6975
01:57:12,080 --> 01:57:12,780
and in seeking

6976
01:57:12,780 --> 01:57:13,580
a reconciliation

6977
01:57:13,580 --> 01:57:14,060
with the long

6978
01:57:14,060 --> 01:57:14,940
born family,

6979
01:57:14,940 --> 01:57:16,400
he had a wife in view

6980
01:57:16,580 --> 01:57:17,180
as he meant

6981
01:57:17,180 --> 01:57:17,700
to choose

6982
01:57:17,700 --> 01:57:18,740
one of the daughters

6983
01:57:18,740 --> 01:57:19,620
if he found them

6984
01:57:19,620 --> 01:57:20,820
as handsome and amiable

6985
01:57:20,820 --> 01:57:21,660
as they were represented

6986
01:57:21,660 --> 01:57:22,860
by Common Report.

6987
01:57:23,180 --> 01:57:24,440
This was his plan of a

6988
01:57:24,440 --> 01:57:25,880
means of atonement

6989
01:57:26,100 --> 01:57:27,080
for inheriting their

6990
01:57:27,080 --> 01:57:28,280
father's estate.

6991
01:57:28,400 --> 01:57:29,420
And he thought it an.

6992
01:57:29,420 --> 01:57:30,720
Excellent one, full

6993
01:57:30,720 --> 01:57:31,640
of eligibility

6994
01:57:31,640 --> 01:57:32,720
and suitable ness

6995
01:57:32,720 --> 01:57:34,200
and excessively generous

6996
01:57:34,200 --> 01:57:35,220
and disinterested

6997
01:57:35,220 --> 01:57:36,420
on his own part.

6998
01:57:36,960 --> 01:57:38,480
His plan did not vary.

6999
01:57:38,480 --> 01:57:39,660
On seeing them.

7000
01:57:39,660 --> 01:57:40,220
Misspell on

7001
01:57:40,220 --> 01:57:41,180
its lovely face,

7002
01:57:41,180 --> 01:57:42,380
confirmed his views,

7003
01:57:42,440 --> 01:57:43,220
and established

7004
01:57:43,220 --> 01:57:44,100
all his strictest

7005
01:57:44,100 --> 01:57:44,880
notions of what

7006
01:57:44,880 --> 01:57:46,080
was due to seniority.

7007
01:57:46,400 --> 01:57:47,160
And for the first

7008
01:57:47,160 --> 01:57:47,600
evening

7009
01:57:47,600 --> 01:57:48,440
she was his

7010
01:57:48,440 --> 01:57:49,640
settled choice.

7011
01:57:49,800 --> 01:57:50,660
The Next morning,

7012
01:57:50,660 --> 01:57:51,200
however, made

7013
01:57:51,200 --> 01:57:52,260
an alteration.

7014
01:57:52,260 --> 01:57:53,180
Four and a quarter of

7015
01:57:53,180 --> 01:57:53,820
an hour's tete

7016
01:57:53,820 --> 01:57:54,600
a tete with Mrs.

7017
01:57:54,600 --> 01:57:54,860
Bennett

7018
01:57:54,860 --> 01:57:56,000
before breakfast,

7019
01:57:56,000 --> 01:57:57,260
a conversation beginning

7020
01:57:57,260 --> 01:57:58,460
with his parsonage house

7021
01:57:58,520 --> 01:57:59,720
and leading naturally

7022
01:57:59,720 --> 01:58:00,920
the avowal of his hopes

7023
01:58:01,020 --> 01:58:01,800
that a mistress

7024
01:58:01,800 --> 01:58:02,540
might be found for

7025
01:58:02,540 --> 01:58:03,020
it had long.

7026
01:58:03,020 --> 01:58:04,160
Borne produced.

7027
01:58:04,160 --> 01:58:05,060
From her amid

7028
01:58:05,060 --> 01:58:06,480
very complaisant smiles

7029
01:58:06,480 --> 01:58:06,920
and general

7030
01:58:06,920 --> 01:58:07,980
encouragement.

7031
01:58:07,980 --> 01:58:08,580
A caution.

7032
01:58:08,580 --> 01:58:09,740
Against the very gaon

7033
01:58:09,740 --> 01:58:10,940
he had fixed on.

7034
01:58:11,240 --> 01:58:11,880
As to her

7035
01:58:11,880 --> 01:58:13,100
younger daughters.

7036
01:58:13,280 --> 01:58:13,880
She could not

7037
01:58:13,880 --> 01:58:15,140
take upon her to say

7038
01:58:15,380 --> 01:58:15,920
she could not

7039
01:58:15,920 --> 01:58:17,220
positively answer,

7040
01:58:17,580 --> 01:58:18,740
but she did not know

7041
01:58:18,740 --> 01:58:19,940
of any pre possession.

7042
01:58:20,100 --> 01:58:21,380
Her eldest daughter,

7043
01:58:21,380 --> 01:58:22,880
she must just mention

7044
01:58:23,100 --> 01:58:24,200
she felt it incumbent

7045
01:58:24,200 --> 01:58:25,200
on her to hint

7046
01:58:25,200 --> 01:58:26,120
what was likely to be

7047
01:58:26,120 --> 01:58:27,680
very soon engaged.

7048
01:58:28,440 --> 01:58:28,820
Mr.

7049
01:58:28,820 --> 01:58:29,360
Collins

7050
01:58:29,360 --> 01:58:30,360
had only to change

7051
01:58:30,360 --> 01:58:31,700
from Jane to Elizabeth,

7052
01:58:31,980 --> 01:58:33,180
and it was soon done.

7053
01:58:33,420 --> 01:58:34,280
Done while Mrs.

7054
01:58:34,280 --> 01:58:34,700
Bennett was

7055
01:58:34,700 --> 01:58:35,900
stirring the fire.

7056
01:58:36,020 --> 01:58:37,100
Elizabeth equally

7057
01:58:37,100 --> 01:58:38,300
next to Jane in birth

7058
01:58:38,300 --> 01:58:39,120
and beauty

7059
01:58:39,120 --> 01:58:39,980
succeeded her.

7060
01:58:39,980 --> 01:58:41,640
Of course, Mrs.

7061
01:58:41,640 --> 01:58:41,960
Bennett

7062
01:58:41,960 --> 01:58:43,140
treasured up the hint

7063
01:58:43,140 --> 01:58:43,820
and trusted

7064
01:58:43,820 --> 01:58:44,660
that she might soon

7065
01:58:44,660 --> 01:58:45,680
have two daughters

7066
01:58:45,680 --> 01:58:47,220
married and the man

7067
01:58:47,220 --> 01:58:47,640
whom she could

7068
01:58:47,640 --> 01:58:48,840
not bear to speak of

7069
01:58:48,900 --> 01:58:50,180
day before was now

7070
01:58:50,180 --> 01:58:51,680
high in her good graces.

7071
01:58:52,620 --> 01:58:53,580
Lydia's intention

7072
01:58:53,580 --> 01:58:54,540
of walking to Maritain

7073
01:58:54,540 --> 01:58:55,740
was not forgotten.

7074
01:58:55,740 --> 01:58:57,240
Every sister except Mary

7075
01:58:57,240 --> 01:58:58,320
agreed to go with her,

7076
01:58:58,320 --> 01:58:58,820
and Mr.

7077
01:58:58,820 --> 01:58:59,340
Collins

7078
01:58:59,340 --> 01:59:00,480
was to attend them

7079
01:59:00,480 --> 01:59:01,680
at the request of Mr.

7080
01:59:01,680 --> 01:59:02,220
Bennett,

7081
01:59:02,220 --> 01:59:03,240
who was most anxious

7082
01:59:03,240 --> 01:59:04,140
to get rid of him

7083
01:59:04,140 --> 01:59:05,180
and have his library

7084
01:59:05,180 --> 01:59:06,140
to himself.

7085
01:59:06,140 --> 01:59:07,040
For thither, Mr.

7086
01:59:07,040 --> 01:59:08,120
Collins had followed him

7087
01:59:08,120 --> 01:59:09,140
after breakfast,

7088
01:59:09,140 --> 01:59:09,680
and there

7089
01:59:09,680 --> 01:59:10,740
he would continue

7090
01:59:10,740 --> 01:59:11,820
nominally engaged

7091
01:59:11,820 --> 01:59:12,240
with one of the

7092
01:59:12,240 --> 01:59:13,160
largest folios

7093
01:59:13,160 --> 01:59:14,100
in the collection.

7094
01:59:14,100 --> 01:59:14,660
But really

7095
01:59:14,660 --> 01:59:15,440
talking to Mr.

7096
01:59:15,440 --> 01:59:15,960
Bennett

7097
01:59:15,960 --> 01:59:17,160
with little cessation.

7098
01:59:17,340 --> 01:59:18,060
Of his house.

7099
01:59:18,060 --> 01:59:19,440
And garden at Hansford.

7100
01:59:19,940 --> 01:59:20,840
Such doings

7101
01:59:20,840 --> 01:59:21,840
just composed Mr.

7102
01:59:21,840 --> 01:59:23,040
Bennett exceedingly.

7103
01:59:23,400 --> 01:59:24,380
In his library,

7104
01:59:24,380 --> 01:59:25,160
he had always been

7105
01:59:25,160 --> 01:59:25,880
sure of leisure

7106
01:59:25,880 --> 01:59:27,080
and tranquility,

7107
01:59:27,120 --> 01:59:28,160
and though prepared

7108
01:59:28,160 --> 01:59:29,360
as he told Elizabeth

7109
01:59:29,360 --> 01:59:30,420
to meet with folly

7110
01:59:30,420 --> 01:59:31,140
and conceit in

7111
01:59:31,140 --> 01:59:31,860
every other room

7112
01:59:31,860 --> 01:59:32,700
of the house.

7113
01:59:32,700 --> 01:59:33,480
He was used to be.

7114
01:59:33,480 --> 01:59:34,680
Free from them there.

7115
01:59:34,880 --> 01:59:36,000
His civility, therefore,

7116
01:59:36,000 --> 01:59:36,920
was most prompt

7117
01:59:36,920 --> 01:59:37,680
in inviting Mr.

7118
01:59:37,680 --> 01:59:38,360
Collins, join

7119
01:59:38,360 --> 01:59:38,880
his daughters

7120
01:59:38,880 --> 01:59:40,260
in their walk, and Mr.

7121
01:59:40,260 --> 01:59:41,780
Collins being, in fact,

7122
01:59:41,780 --> 01:59:42,680
much better fitted

7123
01:59:42,680 --> 01:59:43,400
for a walker

7124
01:59:43,400 --> 01:59:44,280
than a reader,

7125
01:59:44,280 --> 01:59:45,320
was extremely pleased

7126
01:59:45,320 --> 01:59:46,620
to close his large book

7127
01:59:46,760 --> 01:59:48,960
and go in pompous

7128
01:59:48,960 --> 01:59:50,240
nothings on his side.

7129
01:59:50,480 --> 01:59:50,700
And.

7130
01:59:50,700 --> 01:59:51,600
Civil assent

7131
01:59:51,600 --> 01:59:52,800
on that of his cousins.

7132
01:59:52,800 --> 01:59:53,900
Their time passed

7133
01:59:53,900 --> 01:59:54,260
till they

7134
01:59:54,260 --> 01:59:55,460
entered maritain.

7135
01:59:55,640 --> 01:59:56,340
The attention of.

7136
01:59:56,340 --> 01:59:57,060
The younger ones

7137
01:59:57,060 --> 01:59:57,920
was then no longer

7138
01:59:57,920 --> 01:59:59,120
to be gained by him.

7139
01:59:59,280 --> 01:59:59,900
Their eyes

7140
01:59:59,900 --> 02:00:00,540
were immediately

7141
02:00:00,540 --> 02:00:01,340
wandering up

7142
02:00:01,340 --> 02:00:01,940
in the street

7143
02:00:01,940 --> 02:00:02,480
in quest of

7144
02:00:02,480 --> 02:00:03,420
the officers,

7145
02:00:03,420 --> 02:00:03,960
and nothing

7146
02:00:03,960 --> 02:00:04,400
less than

7147
02:00:04,400 --> 02:00:05,600
a very smart bonnet.

7148
02:00:05,600 --> 02:00:06,260
Indeed,

7149
02:00:06,260 --> 02:00:07,580
or a really new muslin

7150
02:00:07,580 --> 02:00:08,880
in a shop window could.

7151
02:00:08,880 --> 02:00:10,080
Recall them.

7152
02:00:10,380 --> 02:00:11,300
But the attention

7153
02:00:11,300 --> 02:00:12,540
of every lady was soon

7154
02:00:12,540 --> 02:00:13,740
caught by young men

7155
02:00:13,880 --> 02:00:14,220
whom they

7156
02:00:14,220 --> 02:00:15,420
had never seen before.

7157
02:00:15,480 --> 02:00:16,040
Of most.

7158
02:00:16,040 --> 02:00:18,120
Gentlemen, like walking

7159
02:00:18,120 --> 02:00:19,040
with another officer

7160
02:00:19,040 --> 02:00:19,520
on the other

7161
02:00:19,520 --> 02:00:19,920
side of the.

7162
02:00:19,920 --> 02:00:20,780
Way.

7163
02:00:20,780 --> 02:00:21,560
The officer was

7164
02:00:21,560 --> 02:00:22,260
the very Mr.

7165
02:00:22,260 --> 02:00:23,340
Denny concerning

7166
02:00:23,340 --> 02:00:23,840
who had returned

7167
02:00:23,840 --> 02:00:24,420
from London.

7168
02:00:24,420 --> 02:00:25,640
Lydia came to inquire

7169
02:00:25,820 --> 02:00:26,580
and he bowed

7170
02:00:26,580 --> 02:00:27,720
as they passed.

7171
02:00:27,720 --> 02:00:28,640
All were struck

7172
02:00:28,640 --> 02:00:29,840
with the strangers air.

7173
02:00:30,060 --> 02:00:30,860
All wondered

7174
02:00:30,860 --> 02:00:32,060
who he could be.

7175
02:00:32,100 --> 02:00:32,780
And Kitty

7176
02:00:32,780 --> 02:00:34,160
and Lydia, determined.

7177
02:00:34,160 --> 02:00:34,740
If possible,

7178
02:00:34,740 --> 02:00:35,960
to find out, led

7179
02:00:35,960 --> 02:00:36,660
the way across

7180
02:00:36,660 --> 02:00:37,460
the street

7181
02:00:37,460 --> 02:00:38,400
under pretense

7182
02:00:38,400 --> 02:00:39,200
of wanting something

7183
02:00:39,200 --> 02:00:40,400
in an opposite shop

7184
02:00:40,460 --> 02:00:41,340
and fortunately had

7185
02:00:41,340 --> 02:00:41,900
just gained

7186
02:00:41,900 --> 02:00:42,680
the pavement.

7187
02:00:42,680 --> 02:00:43,820
When the two gentlemen

7188
02:00:43,820 --> 02:00:45,240
turning back had reached

7189
02:00:45,240 --> 02:00:46,440
the same spot.

7190
02:00:46,980 --> 02:00:47,700
Danny addressed them

7191
02:00:47,700 --> 02:00:48,440
directly

7192
02:00:48,440 --> 02:00:49,460
and entreated permission

7193
02:00:49,460 --> 02:00:49,980
to introduce

7194
02:00:49,980 --> 02:00:51,140
his friend, Mr.

7195
02:00:51,140 --> 02:00:51,800
Wickham,

7196
02:00:51,800 --> 02:00:52,580
who had returned

7197
02:00:52,580 --> 02:00:52,880
with him

7198
02:00:52,880 --> 02:00:53,480
the day before

7199
02:00:53,480 --> 02:00:54,380
from town.

7200
02:00:54,380 --> 02:00:55,160
And he was happy to.

7201
02:00:55,160 --> 02:00:56,000
Say, had accepted

7202
02:00:56,000 --> 02:00:56,480
a commission

7203
02:00:56,480 --> 02:00:57,660
in their corps.

7204
02:00:57,660 --> 02:00:58,800
This was exactly

7205
02:00:58,800 --> 02:00:59,840
as it should be.

7206
02:00:59,840 --> 02:01:00,680
For the young man.

7207
02:01:00,680 --> 02:01:01,880
Wanted only regimental

7208
02:01:01,940 --> 02:01:02,340
to make him

7209
02:01:02,340 --> 02:01:03,660
completely charming.

7210
02:01:04,280 --> 02:01:04,920
His appearance

7211
02:01:04,920 --> 02:01:05,420
was greatly

7212
02:01:05,420 --> 02:01:06,300
in his favor.

7213
02:01:06,300 --> 02:01:07,280
He had all the best

7214
02:01:07,280 --> 02:01:08,340
part of beauty,

7215
02:01:08,340 --> 02:01:09,500
a fine countenance,

7216
02:01:09,500 --> 02:01:10,400
a good figure,

7217
02:01:10,400 --> 02:01:10,880
and very

7218
02:01:10,880 --> 02:01:12,080
pleasing address.

7219
02:01:12,300 --> 02:01:13,280
The introduction was

7220
02:01:13,280 --> 02:01:14,520
followed up on his side

7221
02:01:14,520 --> 02:01:15,540
by a happy readiness,

7222
02:01:15,540 --> 02:01:16,220
a conversation.

7223
02:01:16,220 --> 02:01:16,940
And a.

7224
02:01:16,940 --> 02:01:17,360
Readiness

7225
02:01:17,360 --> 02:01:18,060
at the same time.

7226
02:01:18,060 --> 02:01:18,920
Perfectly correct

7227
02:01:18,920 --> 02:01:20,120
and unassuming.

7228
02:01:20,120 --> 02:01:21,120
And the whole party

7229
02:01:21,120 --> 02:01:22,100
were still standing

7230
02:01:22,100 --> 02:01:22,980
and talking together

7231
02:01:22,980 --> 02:01:24,120
very agreeably.

7232
02:01:24,120 --> 02:01:25,280
When the sound of horses

7233
02:01:25,280 --> 02:01:26,300
drew their notice

7234
02:01:26,300 --> 02:01:27,660
and Darcy and Bingley

7235
02:01:27,660 --> 02:01:27,980
were seen

7236
02:01:27,980 --> 02:01:29,180
riding down the street.

7237
02:01:29,400 --> 02:01:30,260
On distinguishing

7238
02:01:30,260 --> 02:01:31,460
the ladies of the group.

7239
02:01:31,500 --> 02:01:32,600
The two gentlemen came

7240
02:01:32,600 --> 02:01:33,800
directly towards them

7241
02:01:33,900 --> 02:01:34,380
and began

7242
02:01:34,380 --> 02:01:35,600
the usual civilities.

7243
02:01:35,940 --> 02:01:36,420
Bingley

7244
02:01:36,420 --> 02:01:37,080
was the principal

7245
02:01:37,080 --> 02:01:38,240
spokesman and Mr.

7246
02:01:38,240 --> 02:01:38,660
Bennett

7247
02:01:38,660 --> 02:01:39,860
the principal object.

7248
02:01:40,160 --> 02:01:40,880
He was then.

7249
02:01:40,880 --> 02:01:41,820
He said, on his way

7250
02:01:41,820 --> 02:01:42,440
to Long Bourne

7251
02:01:42,440 --> 02:01:43,520
on purpose, to inquire

7252
02:01:43,520 --> 02:01:44,480
after her.

7253
02:01:44,480 --> 02:01:44,820
Mr.

7254
02:01:44,820 --> 02:01:45,200
Darcy

7255
02:01:45,200 --> 02:01:45,980
corroborated it

7256
02:01:45,980 --> 02:01:46,760
with a bow,

7257
02:01:46,760 --> 02:01:47,420
and was beginning

7258
02:01:47,420 --> 02:01:47,940
to determine

7259
02:01:47,940 --> 02:01:49,020
not to fix his eyes

7260
02:01:49,020 --> 02:01:49,760
on Elizabeth

7261
02:01:49,760 --> 02:01:50,220
when they were

7262
02:01:50,220 --> 02:01:51,140
suddenly arrested

7263
02:01:51,140 --> 02:01:51,600
by the side

7264
02:01:51,600 --> 02:01:52,740
of the stranger

7265
02:01:52,740 --> 02:01:53,820
and Elizabeth happening

7266
02:01:53,820 --> 02:01:54,660
to see the countenance

7267
02:01:54,660 --> 02:01:55,200
of both

7268
02:01:55,200 --> 02:01:55,640
as they looked

7269
02:01:55,640 --> 02:01:56,480
at each other

7270
02:01:56,480 --> 02:01:57,780
was all astonishment

7271
02:01:57,780 --> 02:01:58,400
at the effect

7272
02:01:58,400 --> 02:01:59,520
of the meeting.

7273
02:01:59,520 --> 02:02:00,380
Both changed.

7274
02:02:00,380 --> 02:02:01,160
Color.

7275
02:02:01,160 --> 02:02:02,360
One looked white,

7276
02:02:02,460 --> 02:02:04,440
the other read Mr.

7277
02:02:04,440 --> 02:02:04,820
Wickham.

7278
02:02:04,820 --> 02:02:05,720
After a few moments

7279
02:02:05,720 --> 02:02:06,800
touched his hat.

7280
02:02:06,800 --> 02:02:07,700
A salutation which.

7281
02:02:07,700 --> 02:02:07,980
Mr.

7282
02:02:07,980 --> 02:02:09,080
Darcy just deigned

7283
02:02:09,080 --> 02:02:10,280
to return.

7284
02:02:10,340 --> 02:02:10,980
What could be

7285
02:02:10,980 --> 02:02:12,140
the meaning of it?

7286
02:02:12,140 --> 02:02:13,140
It was impossible

7287
02:02:13,140 --> 02:02:14,060
to imagine.

7288
02:02:14,060 --> 02:02:15,060
It was impossible

7289
02:02:15,060 --> 02:02:16,520
not too long to know.

7290
02:02:17,420 --> 02:02:18,600
In another minute, Mr.

7291
02:02:18,600 --> 02:02:19,140
Bingley.

7292
02:02:19,140 --> 02:02:20,060
But without seeming to.

7293
02:02:20,060 --> 02:02:20,540
Have noticed

7294
02:02:20,540 --> 02:02:21,420
what passed.

7295
02:02:21,420 --> 02:02:22,760
Took leave and rode on

7296
02:02:22,760 --> 02:02:23,960
with his friend.

7297
02:02:24,180 --> 02:02:24,980
Mr. Denny and.

7298
02:02:24,980 --> 02:02:25,260
Mr.

7299
02:02:25,260 --> 02:02:25,880
Wickham walked

7300
02:02:25,880 --> 02:02:26,640
with the young ladies

7301
02:02:26,640 --> 02:02:27,320
to the door of Mr.

7302
02:02:27,320 --> 02:02:28,280
Phillips house

7303
02:02:28,280 --> 02:02:28,800
and then made

7304
02:02:28,800 --> 02:02:29,460
their bows.

7305
02:02:29,460 --> 02:02:30,180
In spite of Miss

7306
02:02:30,180 --> 02:02:30,560
Lydia's

7307
02:02:30,560 --> 02:02:31,460
pressing entreaties

7308
02:02:31,460 --> 02:02:31,740
that they

7309
02:02:31,740 --> 02:02:32,600
should come in.

7310
02:02:32,600 --> 02:02:33,540
And even in spite

7311
02:02:33,540 --> 02:02:33,900
of Mrs.

7312
02:02:33,900 --> 02:02:34,260
Phillips

7313
02:02:34,260 --> 02:02:34,680
throwing up

7314
02:02:34,680 --> 02:02:35,720
the parlor window

7315
02:02:35,720 --> 02:02:36,980
and loudly seconding

7316
02:02:36,980 --> 02:02:37,860
the invitation.

7317
02:02:38,840 --> 02:02:39,240
Mrs.

7318
02:02:39,240 --> 02:02:40,140
Phillips was always

7319
02:02:40,140 --> 02:02:41,400
glad to see her nieces,

7320
02:02:41,640 --> 02:02:42,860
and the two eldest

7321
02:02:42,860 --> 02:02:43,260
from their

7322
02:02:43,260 --> 02:02:44,300
recent absence

7323
02:02:44,300 --> 02:02:45,120
were particularly

7324
02:02:45,120 --> 02:02:45,800
welcome,

7325
02:02:45,800 --> 02:02:46,280
and she was

7326
02:02:46,280 --> 02:02:47,240
eagerly expressing

7327
02:02:47,240 --> 02:02:47,840
her surprise

7328
02:02:47,840 --> 02:02:48,380
at their sudden

7329
02:02:48,380 --> 02:02:49,380
return home.

7330
02:02:49,380 --> 02:02:49,860
Which.

7331
02:02:49,860 --> 02:02:50,820
As their own carriage

7332
02:02:50,820 --> 02:02:51,920
had not fetched them.

7333
02:02:51,920 --> 02:02:52,500
She should have known

7334
02:02:52,500 --> 02:02:53,420
nothing about.

7335
02:02:53,420 --> 02:02:54,200
If she had not happened.

7336
02:02:54,200 --> 02:02:54,720
To see Mr.

7337
02:02:54,720 --> 02:02:55,500
Jones's shop

7338
02:02:55,500 --> 02:02:56,520
boy in the street

7339
02:02:56,520 --> 02:02:57,200
who had told her

7340
02:02:57,200 --> 02:02:57,560
that they were

7341
02:02:57,560 --> 02:02:58,100
not to send

7342
02:02:58,100 --> 02:02:58,880
any more drafts

7343
02:02:58,880 --> 02:02:59,720
to Netherfield

7344
02:02:59,720 --> 02:03:00,120
because

7345
02:03:00,120 --> 02:03:00,800
the Miss Bennetts

7346
02:03:00,800 --> 02:03:01,820
were come away.

7347
02:03:01,820 --> 02:03:02,060
When.

7348
02:03:02,060 --> 02:03:03,180
Her civility was claimed

7349
02:03:03,180 --> 02:03:03,740
toward Mr.

7350
02:03:03,740 --> 02:03:05,060
Collins by Jane's

7351
02:03:05,060 --> 02:03:06,260
introduction of him.

7352
02:03:06,480 --> 02:03:07,280
She received him

7353
02:03:07,280 --> 02:03:07,460
with her

7354
02:03:07,460 --> 02:03:08,700
very best politeness,

7355
02:03:08,940 --> 02:03:09,720
which he returned

7356
02:03:09,720 --> 02:03:10,920
with as much more,

7357
02:03:10,940 --> 02:03:11,900
apologizing for

7358
02:03:11,900 --> 02:03:12,780
his intrusion

7359
02:03:12,780 --> 02:03:13,400
without any

7360
02:03:13,400 --> 02:03:14,420
previous acquaintance

7361
02:03:14,420 --> 02:03:15,060
her which

7362
02:03:15,060 --> 02:03:15,740
he could not help.

7363
02:03:15,740 --> 02:03:16,260
Flattering

7364
02:03:16,260 --> 02:03:17,280
himself, however.

7365
02:03:17,280 --> 02:03:18,420
Might be justified.

7366
02:03:18,420 --> 02:03:19,260
By his relationship

7367
02:03:19,260 --> 02:03:20,100
to the young ladies

7368
02:03:20,100 --> 02:03:20,780
who introduced him

7369
02:03:20,780 --> 02:03:21,980
to her notice.

7370
02:03:22,020 --> 02:03:22,400
Mrs.

7371
02:03:22,400 --> 02:03:23,160
Phillips was quite

7372
02:03:23,160 --> 02:03:23,940
awed by such

7373
02:03:23,940 --> 02:03:24,440
an excess

7374
02:03:24,440 --> 02:03:25,460
of good breeding.

7375
02:03:25,460 --> 02:03:25,760
But her

7376
02:03:25,760 --> 02:03:26,540
contemplation of.

7377
02:03:26,540 --> 02:03:27,600
One stranger was soon

7378
02:03:27,600 --> 02:03:28,320
put to an end

7379
02:03:28,320 --> 02:03:29,220
by exclamations

7380
02:03:29,220 --> 02:03:29,760
and inquiries

7381
02:03:29,760 --> 02:03:30,840
about the other.

7382
02:03:30,840 --> 02:03:31,080
Of.

7383
02:03:31,080 --> 02:03:31,800
Whom, however,

7384
02:03:31,800 --> 02:03:32,760
she could only tell her

7385
02:03:32,760 --> 02:03:33,180
nieces

7386
02:03:33,180 --> 02:03:34,380
what they already knew

7387
02:03:34,380 --> 02:03:34,880
that Mr.

7388
02:03:34,880 --> 02:03:35,220
Denny

7389
02:03:35,220 --> 02:03:35,700
had brought him

7390
02:03:35,700 --> 02:03:36,480
from London,

7391
02:03:36,480 --> 02:03:37,440
and that he was to have

7392
02:03:37,440 --> 02:03:38,040
a lieutenant's

7393
02:03:38,040 --> 02:03:38,480
commission

7394
02:03:38,480 --> 02:03:39,720
in the blank share.

7395
02:03:40,160 --> 02:03:40,620
She had been

7396
02:03:40,620 --> 02:03:41,180
watching him.

7397
02:03:41,180 --> 02:03:42,420
The last hour, she said

7398
02:03:42,600 --> 02:03:43,440
as he walked up

7399
02:03:43,440 --> 02:03:44,540
and down the street

7400
02:03:44,540 --> 02:03:45,180
and had Mr.

7401
02:03:45,180 --> 02:03:46,160
Wickham appeared.

7402
02:03:46,160 --> 02:03:47,100
Kitty and Lydia

7403
02:03:47,100 --> 02:03:47,780
would certainly have

7404
02:03:47,780 --> 02:03:48,240
continued

7405
02:03:48,240 --> 02:03:49,440
the occupation,

7406
02:03:49,440 --> 02:03:50,220
but luckily

7407
02:03:50,220 --> 02:03:50,880
no one passed

7408
02:03:50,880 --> 02:03:51,620
windows now

7409
02:03:51,620 --> 02:03:52,280
except a few of

7410
02:03:52,280 --> 02:03:53,300
the officers.

7411
02:03:53,300 --> 02:03:53,600
Who, in.

7412
02:03:53,600 --> 02:03:54,140
Comparison

7413
02:03:54,140 --> 02:03:54,840
with the stranger,

7414
02:03:54,840 --> 02:03:54,960
would.

7415
02:03:54,960 --> 02:03:56,180
Become stupid.

7416
02:03:56,180 --> 02:03:57,380
Disagreeable fellows.

7417
02:03:57,900 --> 02:03:58,400
Some of them

7418
02:03:58,400 --> 02:03:58,860
were to dine

7419
02:03:58,860 --> 02:03:59,540
with the Phillips's

7420
02:03:59,540 --> 02:04:00,560
the next day,

7421
02:04:00,560 --> 02:04:01,700
and their aunt promised

7422
02:04:01,700 --> 02:04:02,580
to make her husband

7423
02:04:02,580 --> 02:04:03,260
call on Mr.

7424
02:04:03,260 --> 02:04:03,780
Wickham

7425
02:04:03,780 --> 02:04:04,320
and give him

7426
02:04:04,320 --> 02:04:04,880
an imitation.

7427
02:04:04,880 --> 02:04:05,540
Also,

7428
02:04:05,540 --> 02:04:06,240
if the family

7429
02:04:06,240 --> 02:04:06,920
from Long Bourn

7430
02:04:06,920 --> 02:04:07,280
would come in

7431
02:04:07,280 --> 02:04:08,280
the evening.

7432
02:04:08,280 --> 02:04:09,480
This was agreed to.

7433
02:04:09,620 --> 02:04:10,100
And Mrs..

7434
02:04:10,100 --> 02:04:11,000
Phillips protested

7435
02:04:11,000 --> 02:04:11,540
that they would have

7436
02:04:11,540 --> 02:04:12,440
a nice, comfortable,

7437
02:04:12,440 --> 02:04:13,160
noisy game

7438
02:04:13,160 --> 02:04:14,360
of lottery tickets

7439
02:04:14,360 --> 02:04:15,260
and a little bit of hot

7440
02:04:15,260 --> 02:04:16,460
supper afterwards.

7441
02:04:16,580 --> 02:04:17,460
The prospect of

7442
02:04:17,460 --> 02:04:18,200
such delights

7443
02:04:18,200 --> 02:04:19,380
was very cheering

7444
02:04:19,380 --> 02:04:20,060
and they parted

7445
02:04:20,060 --> 02:04:21,300
in mutual good spirits.

7446
02:04:21,680 --> 02:04:22,040
Mr.

7447
02:04:22,040 --> 02:04:22,460
Collins

7448
02:04:22,460 --> 02:04:23,640
repeated his apologies,

7449
02:04:23,640 --> 02:04:24,360
quitting the room

7450
02:04:24,360 --> 02:04:25,200
and was assured

7451
02:04:25,200 --> 02:04:25,560
with on

7452
02:04:25,560 --> 02:04:26,640
wearying civility

7453
02:04:26,640 --> 02:04:27,020
that they were

7454
02:04:27,020 --> 02:04:28,220
perfectly needless.

7455
02:04:29,040 --> 02:04:30,240
As they walked home,

7456
02:04:30,320 --> 02:04:31,220
Elizabeth related

7457
02:04:31,220 --> 02:04:31,640
to Jane,

7458
02:04:31,640 --> 02:04:32,240
which she had seen

7459
02:04:32,240 --> 02:04:32,940
passed between.

7460
02:04:32,940 --> 02:04:33,960
The two gentlemen.

7461
02:04:33,960 --> 02:04:34,920
But though Jane would

7462
02:04:34,920 --> 02:04:35,940
have defended either

7463
02:04:35,940 --> 02:04:36,960
or both had

7464
02:04:36,960 --> 02:04:37,440
they appeared

7465
02:04:37,440 --> 02:04:38,520
to be in the wrong.

7466
02:04:38,520 --> 02:04:38,840
She could

7467
02:04:38,840 --> 02:04:39,780
no more explain

7468
02:04:39,780 --> 02:04:40,620
such behavior

7469
02:04:40,620 --> 02:04:41,820
than her sister.

7470
02:04:42,200 --> 02:04:42,560
Mr.

7471
02:04:42,560 --> 02:04:43,880
Collins, his return

7472
02:04:44,100 --> 02:04:45,380
highly gratified Mrs.

7473
02:04:45,380 --> 02:04:45,920
Bennett.

7474
02:04:45,920 --> 02:04:46,140
By.

7475
02:04:46,140 --> 02:04:46,940
Admiring Mrs.

7476
02:04:46,940 --> 02:04:47,900
Phillips's manners

7477
02:04:47,900 --> 02:04:49,100
and politeness.

7478
02:04:49,200 --> 02:04:50,040
He protested

7479
02:04:50,040 --> 02:04:51,300
that except Lady

7480
02:04:51,300 --> 02:04:51,720
Catherine

7481
02:04:51,720 --> 02:04:52,640
and her daughter,

7482
02:04:52,640 --> 02:04:53,420
he had never seen

7483
02:04:53,420 --> 02:04:54,620
a more elegant woman.

7484
02:04:54,800 --> 02:04:55,740
For she had not only

7485
02:04:55,740 --> 02:04:56,300
received him

7486
02:04:56,300 --> 02:04:57,060
with the utmost

7487
02:04:57,060 --> 02:04:57,840
civility.

7488
02:04:57,840 --> 02:04:58,860
But even pointedly.

7489
02:04:58,860 --> 02:04:59,520
Included him

7490
02:04:59,520 --> 02:05:00,260
in her invitation

7491
02:05:00,260 --> 02:05:01,320
for the next evening,

7492
02:05:01,320 --> 02:05:02,460
although utterly unknown

7493
02:05:02,460 --> 02:05:02,640
to her

7494
02:05:02,640 --> 02:05:04,280
before something

7495
02:05:04,280 --> 02:05:05,120
he supposed.

7496
02:05:05,120 --> 02:05:06,140
Might be attributed

7497
02:05:06,140 --> 02:05:06,900
to his connection

7498
02:05:06,900 --> 02:05:07,700
with them.

7499
02:05:07,700 --> 02:05:08,940
But yet he had never met

7500
02:05:08,940 --> 02:05:10,220
with so much attention

7501
02:05:10,400 --> 02:05:11,000
in the whole

7502
02:05:11,000 --> 02:05:12,200
course of his life.

7503
02:05:13,560 --> 02:05:14,760
Chapter 16.

7504
02:05:16,200 --> 02:05:16,640
As no

7505
02:05:16,640 --> 02:05:17,580
objection was made

7506
02:05:17,580 --> 02:05:18,020
to the young

7507
02:05:18,020 --> 02:05:18,980
people's engagement

7508
02:05:18,980 --> 02:05:19,860
with their aunt

7509
02:05:19,860 --> 02:05:20,600
and all Mr.

7510
02:05:20,600 --> 02:05:21,080
Collins's

7511
02:05:21,080 --> 02:05:22,340
scruples of leaving Mr.

7512
02:05:22,340 --> 02:05:22,740
and Mrs.

7513
02:05:22,740 --> 02:05:23,040
Bennett

7514
02:05:23,040 --> 02:05:23,600
for a single

7515
02:05:23,600 --> 02:05:24,300
evening during

7516
02:05:24,300 --> 02:05:25,040
his visit were most

7517
02:05:25,040 --> 02:05:26,240
steadily resisted.

7518
02:05:26,480 --> 02:05:27,420
The coach conveyed

7519
02:05:27,420 --> 02:05:28,700
him and his five cousins

7520
02:05:28,700 --> 02:05:29,600
at a suitable hour

7521
02:05:29,600 --> 02:05:30,560
to Maritain,

7522
02:05:30,560 --> 02:05:31,220
and the girls

7523
02:05:31,220 --> 02:05:31,800
had the pleasure

7524
02:05:31,800 --> 02:05:32,520
of hearing

7525
02:05:32,520 --> 02:05:33,260
as they entered

7526
02:05:33,260 --> 02:05:34,160
the drawing room

7527
02:05:34,160 --> 02:05:34,680
that Mr.

7528
02:05:34,680 --> 02:05:35,600
Wickham had accepted

7529
02:05:35,600 --> 02:05:36,800
their uncle's invitation

7530
02:05:36,960 --> 02:05:37,760
and was then

7531
02:05:37,760 --> 02:05:38,960
in the house

7532
02:05:39,140 --> 02:05:40,160
when this information

7533
02:05:40,160 --> 02:05:40,880
was given

7534
02:05:40,880 --> 02:05:41,820
and they had all taken

7535
02:05:41,820 --> 02:05:42,680
their seats.

7536
02:05:42,680 --> 02:05:43,040
Mr.

7537
02:05:43,040 --> 02:05:44,180
Collins was at leisure

7538
02:05:44,180 --> 02:05:44,840
to look around

7539
02:05:44,840 --> 02:05:46,220
him and admire, and he.

7540
02:05:46,220 --> 02:05:47,340
Was so much struck.

7541
02:05:47,340 --> 02:05:48,000
With the size

7542
02:05:48,000 --> 02:05:48,600
and furniture

7543
02:05:48,600 --> 02:05:49,620
of the apartment

7544
02:05:49,620 --> 02:05:50,360
that he declared

7545
02:05:50,360 --> 02:05:51,260
he might almost have

7546
02:05:51,260 --> 02:05:52,080
supposed himself

7547
02:05:52,080 --> 02:05:52,980
in the small summer

7548
02:05:52,980 --> 02:05:53,780
breakfast parlor

7549
02:05:53,780 --> 02:05:54,200
at Rose.

7550
02:05:54,200 --> 02:05:55,020
Kings.

7551
02:05:55,020 --> 02:05:55,760
A comparison

7552
02:05:55,760 --> 02:05:56,280
that did not

7553
02:05:56,280 --> 02:05:56,960
at first convey

7554
02:05:56,960 --> 02:05:58,160
much gratification.

7555
02:05:58,380 --> 02:05:59,220
But when Mrs.

7556
02:05:59,220 --> 02:06:00,000
Phillips understood

7557
02:06:00,000 --> 02:06:00,300
from him.

7558
02:06:00,300 --> 02:06:01,500
What Rose Ings was

7559
02:06:01,580 --> 02:06:02,280
and who was.

7560
02:06:02,280 --> 02:06:03,480
Its proprietor.

7561
02:06:03,480 --> 02:06:04,320
When she had listened

7562
02:06:04,320 --> 02:06:04,980
to the description

7563
02:06:04,980 --> 02:06:05,960
of only one of Lady

7564
02:06:05,960 --> 02:06:06,740
Katherine's drawing.

7565
02:06:06,740 --> 02:06:07,860
Rooms and found.

7566
02:06:07,860 --> 02:06:08,060
That the

7567
02:06:08,060 --> 02:06:09,260
chimney piece alone had.

7568
02:06:09,260 --> 02:06:11,720
Cost ?800, she felt all.

7569
02:06:11,720 --> 02:06:12,540
The force of the.

7570
02:06:12,540 --> 02:06:13,760
Compliment and would.

7571
02:06:13,760 --> 02:06:14,660
Hardly have resented

7572
02:06:14,660 --> 02:06:15,320
a comparison

7573
02:06:15,320 --> 02:06:15,540
with the

7574
02:06:15,540 --> 02:06:16,520
housekeeper's room.

7575
02:06:17,520 --> 02:06:18,660
In describing to her

7576
02:06:18,660 --> 02:06:19,820
all the grandeur of Lady

7577
02:06:19,820 --> 02:06:20,240
Katharine

7578
02:06:20,240 --> 02:06:21,200
and her mansion

7579
02:06:21,200 --> 02:06:21,960
with occasional

7580
02:06:21,960 --> 02:06:22,620
digressions

7581
02:06:22,620 --> 02:06:23,040
in praise

7582
02:06:23,040 --> 02:06:24,240
of his own humble abode

7583
02:06:24,440 --> 02:06:25,440
and the improvements

7584
02:06:25,440 --> 02:06:26,540
it was receiving,

7585
02:06:26,540 --> 02:06:27,800
he was happily employed

7586
02:06:27,800 --> 02:06:28,560
until the gentleman

7587
02:06:28,560 --> 02:06:29,480
joined them

7588
02:06:29,480 --> 02:06:30,540
and he found and Mrs.

7589
02:06:30,540 --> 02:06:30,900
Phillips,

7590
02:06:30,900 --> 02:06:31,220
a very

7591
02:06:31,220 --> 02:06:32,420
attentive listener.

7592
02:06:32,460 --> 02:06:33,300
Whose opinion of his.

7593
02:06:33,300 --> 02:06:34,320
Consequence increased

7594
02:06:34,320 --> 02:06:35,480
with what she heard

7595
02:06:35,480 --> 02:06:36,380
and she was resolving

7596
02:06:36,380 --> 02:06:37,280
to retain it all

7597
02:06:37,280 --> 02:06:38,100
among her neighbors

7598
02:06:38,100 --> 02:06:38,480
as soon as.

7599
02:06:38,480 --> 02:06:39,620
She could.

7600
02:06:39,620 --> 02:06:40,340
To girls

7601
02:06:40,340 --> 02:06:41,100
who could not listen

7602
02:06:41,100 --> 02:06:42,000
to their cousin

7603
02:06:42,000 --> 02:06:42,720
and who had nothing

7604
02:06:42,720 --> 02:06:43,040
to do

7605
02:06:43,040 --> 02:06:43,520
but to wish

7606
02:06:43,520 --> 02:06:44,420
for an instrument

7607
02:06:44,420 --> 02:06:45,060
and examine

7608
02:06:45,060 --> 02:06:45,420
their own

7609
02:06:45,420 --> 02:06:45,920
indifferent

7610
02:06:45,920 --> 02:06:47,040
imitations of China

7611
02:06:47,040 --> 02:06:48,200
on the mantelpiece.

7612
02:06:48,200 --> 02:06:48,780
The interval

7613
02:06:48,780 --> 02:06:49,760
of waiting appeared

7614
02:06:49,760 --> 02:06:50,960
very long.

7615
02:06:51,060 --> 02:06:52,260
It was over at last.

7616
02:06:52,260 --> 02:06:53,580
However, the gentleman

7617
02:06:53,580 --> 02:06:54,480
did approach,

7618
02:06:54,480 --> 02:06:55,220
and when Mr.

7619
02:06:55,220 --> 02:06:55,860
Wickham walked

7620
02:06:55,860 --> 02:06:56,820
into the room,

7621
02:06:56,820 --> 02:06:57,600
Elizabeth felt

7622
02:06:57,600 --> 02:06:58,280
that she had neither

7623
02:06:58,280 --> 02:06:59,520
been seeing him before

7624
02:06:59,700 --> 02:07:00,480
nor thinking of him

7625
02:07:00,480 --> 02:07:01,140
since,

7626
02:07:01,140 --> 02:07:02,240
with the smallest degree

7627
02:07:02,240 --> 02:07:03,000
of unreasonable

7628
02:07:03,000 --> 02:07:04,200
admiration.

7629
02:07:04,260 --> 02:07:05,060
The officers

7630
02:07:05,060 --> 02:07:06,120
of the Blackshear

7631
02:07:06,120 --> 02:07:06,840
were in general

7632
02:07:06,840 --> 02:07:07,200
a very

7633
02:07:07,200 --> 02:07:08,240
creditable gentleman

7634
02:07:08,240 --> 02:07:09,140
like set,

7635
02:07:09,140 --> 02:07:10,100
and the best of them

7636
02:07:10,100 --> 02:07:10,400
were of the

7637
02:07:10,400 --> 02:07:11,600
present party.

7638
02:07:11,640 --> 02:07:12,140
But Mr.

7639
02:07:12,140 --> 02:07:13,100
Wickham was as far

7640
02:07:13,100 --> 02:07:13,640
beyond them

7641
02:07:13,640 --> 02:07:14,580
all in person.

7642
02:07:14,580 --> 02:07:16,200
Countenance ere and walk

7643
02:07:16,460 --> 02:07:17,660
as they were superior

7644
02:07:17,660 --> 02:07:18,180
to the broad

7645
02:07:18,180 --> 02:07:19,740
faced stuffy Philip's

7646
02:07:19,980 --> 02:07:21,300
breathing port wine,

7647
02:07:21,440 --> 02:07:22,200
who followed them

7648
02:07:22,200 --> 02:07:22,920
into the room.

7649
02:07:24,000 --> 02:07:24,380
Mr.

7650
02:07:24,380 --> 02:07:24,980
Wickham was the

7651
02:07:24,980 --> 02:07:26,340
happy man towards whom?

7652
02:07:26,340 --> 02:07:27,540
Almost every female

7653
02:07:27,560 --> 02:07:28,700
I was turned.

7654
02:07:28,700 --> 02:07:29,580
And Elizabeth

7655
02:07:29,580 --> 02:07:30,540
was the happy woman

7656
02:07:30,540 --> 02:07:30,900
by whom

7657
02:07:30,900 --> 02:07:31,460
he finally

7658
02:07:31,460 --> 02:07:32,600
seated himself.

7659
02:07:32,600 --> 02:07:33,740
And the agreeable manner

7660
02:07:33,740 --> 02:07:34,580
in which he immediately

7661
02:07:34,580 --> 02:07:35,780
fell into conversation.

7662
02:07:36,000 --> 02:07:36,680
Though it was only.

7663
02:07:36,680 --> 02:07:37,620
On its being a wet.

7664
02:07:37,620 --> 02:07:38,700
Night, made her.

7665
02:07:38,700 --> 02:07:39,120
Feel that

7666
02:07:39,120 --> 02:07:40,400
the commonest, dullest,

7667
02:07:40,400 --> 02:07:41,760
most threadbare topic

7668
02:07:41,960 --> 02:07:42,800
might be rendered

7669
02:07:42,800 --> 02:07:44,180
interesting by the skill

7670
02:07:44,180 --> 02:07:45,380
of the speaker.

7671
02:07:45,740 --> 02:07:46,760
With such rivals

7672
02:07:46,760 --> 02:07:47,340
for the notice

7673
02:07:47,340 --> 02:07:48,260
of the fair as Mr.

7674
02:07:48,260 --> 02:07:48,600
Wickham

7675
02:07:48,600 --> 02:07:49,980
and the officers, Mr.

7676
02:07:49,980 --> 02:07:51,180
Collins seemed to sink

7677
02:07:51,180 --> 02:07:52,380
into insignificance

7678
02:07:52,500 --> 02:07:53,460
to the young ladies.

7679
02:07:53,460 --> 02:07:53,940
He certainly

7680
02:07:53,940 --> 02:07:54,780
was nothing.

7681
02:07:54,780 --> 02:07:55,100
But he.

7682
02:07:55,100 --> 02:07:56,160
Had still at intervals

7683
02:07:56,160 --> 02:07:57,240
a kind listener and Mrs.

7684
02:07:57,240 --> 02:07:57,960
Phillips,

7685
02:07:57,960 --> 02:07:58,460
and was,

7686
02:07:58,460 --> 02:07:59,640
by her watchfulness.

7687
02:07:59,640 --> 02:07:59,940
Most.

7688
02:07:59,940 --> 02:08:00,900
Abundantly supplied

7689
02:08:00,900 --> 02:08:02,180
with coffee and muffin.

7690
02:08:02,700 --> 02:08:03,360
When the cards

7691
02:08:03,360 --> 02:08:04,400
tables were placed.

7692
02:08:04,400 --> 02:08:05,580
He had the opportunity

7693
02:08:05,580 --> 02:08:06,860
of obliging her in turn

7694
02:08:06,980 --> 02:08:08,540
by sitting down to West.

7695
02:08:09,080 --> 02:08:09,600
I know

7696
02:08:09,600 --> 02:08:10,340
little of the game

7697
02:08:10,340 --> 02:08:11,540
at present, said he,

7698
02:08:11,760 --> 02:08:12,620
but I shall be glad

7699
02:08:12,620 --> 02:08:13,980
to improve myself for

7700
02:08:13,980 --> 02:08:15,260
in my situation of life.

7701
02:08:15,560 --> 02:08:15,960
Mrs.

7702
02:08:15,960 --> 02:08:17,060
Phillips was very glad

7703
02:08:17,060 --> 02:08:18,140
for his compliance.

7704
02:08:18,140 --> 02:08:19,220
But could not wait.

7705
02:08:19,220 --> 02:08:20,420
For his reason.

7706
02:08:21,020 --> 02:08:21,380
Mr.

7707
02:08:21,380 --> 02:08:21,860
Wickham did

7708
02:08:21,860 --> 02:08:23,060
not play it west,

7709
02:08:23,100 --> 02:08:24,140
and with ready delight

7710
02:08:24,140 --> 02:08:24,840
was he received

7711
02:08:24,840 --> 02:08:25,620
at the other table

7712
02:08:25,620 --> 02:08:26,360
between Elizabeth

7713
02:08:26,360 --> 02:08:27,380
and Lydia.

7714
02:08:27,380 --> 02:08:28,080
At first

7715
02:08:28,080 --> 02:08:28,580
there seemed

7716
02:08:28,580 --> 02:08:29,480
danger of Lydia's

7717
02:08:29,480 --> 02:08:29,940
engrossing

7718
02:08:29,940 --> 02:08:30,840
hymn entirely,

7719
02:08:30,840 --> 02:08:31,680
for she was the most

7720
02:08:31,680 --> 02:08:32,880
determined talker,

7721
02:08:33,140 --> 02:08:34,200
but being likewise

7722
02:08:34,200 --> 02:08:34,980
extremely fond

7723
02:08:34,980 --> 02:08:36,080
of lottery tickets.

7724
02:08:36,080 --> 02:08:37,260
She soon grew much.

7725
02:08:37,260 --> 02:08:38,460
Interested in the game.

7726
02:08:38,540 --> 02:08:38,840
Too.

7727
02:08:38,840 --> 02:08:40,040
Eager and making bets

7728
02:08:40,040 --> 02:08:40,700
and exclaiming

7729
02:08:40,700 --> 02:08:41,760
after prizes

7730
02:08:41,760 --> 02:08:42,500
to have attention

7731
02:08:42,500 --> 02:08:43,040
for anyone

7732
02:08:43,040 --> 02:08:44,180
in particular,

7733
02:08:44,180 --> 02:08:45,300
allowing for the common

7734
02:08:45,300 --> 02:08:46,500
demands of the game.

7735
02:08:46,500 --> 02:08:46,820
Mr.

7736
02:08:46,820 --> 02:08:47,700
Wickham was therefore

7737
02:08:47,700 --> 02:08:48,120
at leisure

7738
02:08:48,120 --> 02:08:49,320
to talk to Elizabeth,

7739
02:08:49,400 --> 02:08:50,340
and she was very willing

7740
02:08:50,340 --> 02:08:51,200
to hear him,

7741
02:08:51,200 --> 02:08:52,200
Though what she chiefly

7742
02:08:52,200 --> 02:08:52,820
wished to hear,

7743
02:08:52,820 --> 02:08:53,580
she could not hope

7744
02:08:53,580 --> 02:08:54,680
to be. Told the.

7745
02:08:54,680 --> 02:08:55,140
History

7746
02:08:55,140 --> 02:08:55,800
of his acquaintance

7747
02:08:55,800 --> 02:08:56,180
with Mr.

7748
02:08:56,180 --> 02:08:57,140
Darcy.

7749
02:08:57,140 --> 02:08:57,620
She dared

7750
02:08:57,620 --> 02:08:58,440
not even mention

7751
02:08:58,440 --> 02:08:59,640
that gentleman.

7752
02:08:59,820 --> 02:09:00,660
Her curiosity,

7753
02:09:00,660 --> 02:09:01,100
however, was

7754
02:09:01,100 --> 02:09:02,520
unexpectedly relieved.

7755
02:09:02,760 --> 02:09:03,120
Mr.

7756
02:09:03,120 --> 02:09:03,740
Wickham began

7757
02:09:03,740 --> 02:09:04,940
the subject himself.

7758
02:09:05,280 --> 02:09:05,960
He inquired

7759
02:09:05,960 --> 02:09:06,860
how far Netherfield

7760
02:09:06,860 --> 02:09:08,000
was from Moreton,

7761
02:09:08,000 --> 02:09:09,060
and after receiving her

7762
02:09:09,060 --> 02:09:09,800
answer,

7763
02:09:09,800 --> 02:09:10,400
asked in a

7764
02:09:10,400 --> 02:09:11,280
hesitating manner

7765
02:09:11,280 --> 02:09:12,000
how long Mr.

7766
02:09:12,000 --> 02:09:12,680
Darcy had been

7767
02:09:12,680 --> 02:09:13,880
staying there.

7768
02:09:14,120 --> 02:09:15,300
About a month.

7769
02:09:15,300 --> 02:09:16,400
Said Elizabeth.

7770
02:09:16,400 --> 02:09:17,360
And then unwilling

7771
02:09:17,360 --> 02:09:18,180
to let the subject

7772
02:09:18,180 --> 02:09:19,380
drop at it.

7773
02:09:19,640 --> 02:09:20,280
He is a man.

7774
02:09:20,280 --> 02:09:21,320
Of very large property

7775
02:09:21,320 --> 02:09:22,020
in Derbyshire.

7776
02:09:22,020 --> 02:09:23,220
I understand.

7777
02:09:23,400 --> 02:09:25,020
Yes, replied Wickham.

7778
02:09:25,220 --> 02:09:25,800
His estate.

7779
02:09:25,800 --> 02:09:26,960
There is a noble one.

7780
02:09:26,960 --> 02:09:28,280
A clear 10,000

7781
02:09:28,280 --> 02:09:29,100
per annum.

7782
02:09:29,100 --> 02:09:30,000
You could not have met

7783
02:09:30,000 --> 02:09:30,600
with a person

7784
02:09:30,600 --> 02:09:31,340
more capable

7785
02:09:31,340 --> 02:09:31,820
of giving you

7786
02:09:31,820 --> 02:09:32,840
certain information

7787
02:09:32,840 --> 02:09:33,480
on that hedge

7788
02:09:33,480 --> 02:09:34,680
than myself.

7789
02:09:34,680 --> 02:09:34,860
For

7790
02:09:34,860 --> 02:09:35,960
I have been connected

7791
02:09:35,960 --> 02:09:36,720
his family

7792
02:09:36,720 --> 02:09:37,460
in a particular

7793
02:09:37,460 --> 02:09:38,960
manner from my infancy.

7794
02:09:42,980 --> 02:09:43,580
You may well

7795
02:09:43,580 --> 02:09:44,220
be surprised,

7796
02:09:44,220 --> 02:09:44,780
Miss Bennet,

7797
02:09:44,780 --> 02:09:45,980
at such an assertion,

7798
02:09:46,040 --> 02:09:46,380
after

7799
02:09:46,380 --> 02:09:47,180
seeing as you

7800
02:09:47,180 --> 02:09:47,960
probably might,

7801
02:09:47,960 --> 02:09:48,980
the very cold manner

7802
02:09:48,980 --> 02:09:49,220
of our

7803
02:09:49,220 --> 02:09:50,420
meeting yesterday.

7804
02:09:50,660 --> 02:09:51,720
Are you much acquainted

7805
02:09:51,720 --> 02:09:52,100
with Mr.

7806
02:09:52,100 --> 02:09:53,060
Darcy?

7807
02:09:53,060 --> 02:09:53,960
As much as I ever

7808
02:09:53,960 --> 02:09:55,040
wish to be.

7809
02:09:55,040 --> 02:09:55,820
Cried Elizabeth

7810
02:09:55,820 --> 02:09:57,020
very warmly.

7811
02:09:57,020 --> 02:09:58,340
I have spent four days

7812
02:09:58,340 --> 02:09:59,100
in the same house

7813
02:09:59,100 --> 02:09:59,660
with him

7814
02:09:59,660 --> 02:10:00,260
and think him

7815
02:10:00,260 --> 02:10:01,460
very disagreeable.

7816
02:10:02,360 --> 02:10:03,540
I have no right to give

7817
02:10:03,540 --> 02:10:04,740
my opinion,

7818
02:10:04,820 --> 02:10:05,840
said Wickham,

7819
02:10:05,840 --> 02:10:06,360
as to his

7820
02:10:06,360 --> 02:10:07,140
being agreeable

7821
02:10:07,140 --> 02:10:08,060
or otherwise.

7822
02:10:08,060 --> 02:10:08,940
I'm not qualified

7823
02:10:08,940 --> 02:10:09,720
to form one.

7824
02:10:09,720 --> 02:10:10,620
I have known him too

7825
02:10:10,620 --> 02:10:11,180
long and too

7826
02:10:11,180 --> 02:10:12,380
well to be a fair judge.

7827
02:10:12,920 --> 02:10:13,760
It is impossible

7828
02:10:13,760 --> 02:10:15,060
for me to be impartial,

7829
02:10:15,660 --> 02:10:16,260
but I believe

7830
02:10:16,260 --> 02:10:17,300
your opinion of him

7831
02:10:17,300 --> 02:10:17,660
would in

7832
02:10:17,660 --> 02:10:18,860
general astonish,

7833
02:10:19,440 --> 02:10:20,280
and perhaps you would

7834
02:10:20,280 --> 02:10:21,000
not express it

7835
02:10:21,000 --> 02:10:21,900
quite so strongly

7836
02:10:21,900 --> 02:10:22,980
anywhere else.

7837
02:10:22,980 --> 02:10:23,880
Here you are in your

7838
02:10:23,880 --> 02:10:24,620
own family.

7839
02:10:25,740 --> 02:10:26,940
Upon my word,

7840
02:10:27,060 --> 02:10:27,380
I say

7841
02:10:27,380 --> 02:10:27,720
no more

7842
02:10:27,720 --> 02:10:28,740
here than I might say in

7843
02:10:28,740 --> 02:10:29,160
any house

7844
02:10:29,160 --> 02:10:30,120
in the neighborhood.

7845
02:10:30,120 --> 02:10:30,600
Except.

7846
02:10:30,600 --> 02:10:31,680
Netherfield.

7847
02:10:31,680 --> 02:10:32,520
He is not at all

7848
02:10:32,520 --> 02:10:33,720
liked in Hertfordshire.

7849
02:10:34,080 --> 02:10:35,480
Everybody is disgusted

7850
02:10:35,480 --> 02:10:36,660
with his pride.

7851
02:10:36,660 --> 02:10:37,560
You will not find him

7852
02:10:37,560 --> 02:10:38,220
more favorably.

7853
02:10:38,220 --> 02:10:39,540
Spoken by anyone.

7854
02:10:40,400 --> 02:10:41,420
I cannot pretend

7855
02:10:41,420 --> 02:10:42,620
to be sorry.

7856
02:10:42,780 --> 02:10:43,400
Said Wickham,

7857
02:10:43,400 --> 02:10:44,160
after a short

7858
02:10:44,160 --> 02:10:45,360
interruption.

7859
02:10:45,480 --> 02:10:46,880
That he or that any man

7860
02:10:46,880 --> 02:10:48,060
should not be estimated

7861
02:10:48,060 --> 02:10:49,260
to be on their desserts.

7862
02:10:49,440 --> 02:10:50,400
But with him,

7863
02:10:50,400 --> 02:10:50,940
I believe

7864
02:10:50,940 --> 02:10:51,180
it does

7865
02:10:51,180 --> 02:10:52,260
not often happen.

7866
02:10:52,260 --> 02:10:53,300
The world is blinded

7867
02:10:53,300 --> 02:10:54,120
by his fortune

7868
02:10:54,120 --> 02:10:55,100
and consequence,

7869
02:10:55,100 --> 02:10:55,860
or frightened

7870
02:10:55,860 --> 02:10:56,480
by his high

7871
02:10:56,480 --> 02:10:57,680
and imposing manners

7872
02:10:57,800 --> 02:10:58,820
and sees him only

7873
02:10:58,820 --> 02:10:59,580
as he chooses

7874
02:10:59,580 --> 02:11:00,780
to be seen.

7875
02:11:01,440 --> 02:11:02,640
I should take him,

7876
02:11:02,660 --> 02:11:03,740
even on my slight

7877
02:11:03,740 --> 02:11:04,760
acquaintance, to be

7878
02:11:04,760 --> 02:11:06,020
an ill tempered man.

7879
02:11:06,720 --> 02:11:07,440
Wickham only

7880
02:11:07,440 --> 02:11:08,640
shook his head.

7881
02:11:08,940 --> 02:11:10,140
I wonder.

7882
02:11:10,640 --> 02:11:11,360
Said he, at the

7883
02:11:11,360 --> 02:11:12,180
next opportunity

7884
02:11:12,180 --> 02:11:12,740
of speaking.

7885
02:11:13,880 --> 02:11:14,340
Whether he is

7886
02:11:14,340 --> 02:11:15,000
likely to be in

7887
02:11:15,000 --> 02:11:15,500
this country

7888
02:11:15,500 --> 02:11:16,700
much longer.

7889
02:11:17,580 --> 02:11:18,800
I do not at all know.

7890
02:11:19,140 --> 02:11:20,120
But I heard nothing.

7891
02:11:20,120 --> 02:11:20,780
He was going away

7892
02:11:20,780 --> 02:11:21,200
when I was

7893
02:11:21,200 --> 02:11:22,400
at Netherfield.

7894
02:11:23,400 --> 02:11:24,320
I hope your plans

7895
02:11:24,320 --> 02:11:24,860
in favor of

7896
02:11:24,860 --> 02:11:25,460
the blank show

7897
02:11:25,460 --> 02:11:25,780
will not

7898
02:11:25,780 --> 02:11:26,720
be affected by his

7899
02:11:26,720 --> 02:11:27,920
being in the.

7900
02:11:29,220 --> 02:11:30,420
Oh, no.

7901
02:11:30,480 --> 02:11:31,280
It is not for me

7902
02:11:31,280 --> 02:11:32,400
to be driven away by Mr.

7903
02:11:32,400 --> 02:11:33,380
Darcy.

7904
02:11:33,380 --> 02:11:34,580
If he wishes to avoid

7905
02:11:34,580 --> 02:11:35,780
seeing me, he must go.

7906
02:11:36,660 --> 02:11:37,220
We not on

7907
02:11:37,220 --> 02:11:38,060
friendly terms.

7908
02:11:38,060 --> 02:11:38,940
And it always gives me

7909
02:11:38,940 --> 02:11:40,140
pain to meet him.

7910
02:11:40,140 --> 02:11:41,100
But I have no reason

7911
02:11:41,100 --> 02:11:42,300
for avoiding him.

7912
02:11:42,420 --> 02:11:42,800
But what I

7913
02:11:42,800 --> 02:11:43,400
might proclaim

7914
02:11:43,400 --> 02:11:44,600
to all the world.

7915
02:11:45,320 --> 02:11:46,500
A sense of very great

7916
02:11:46,500 --> 02:11:47,700
ill usage

7917
02:11:47,780 --> 02:11:49,260
and most painful regrets

7918
02:11:49,260 --> 02:11:49,800
at his being.

7919
02:11:49,800 --> 02:11:51,000
What he is

7920
02:11:52,200 --> 02:11:53,160
his father.

7921
02:11:53,160 --> 02:11:53,880
Miss Bennet,

7922
02:11:53,880 --> 02:11:54,660
the late Mr.

7923
02:11:54,660 --> 02:11:55,620
Darcy, was

7924
02:11:55,620 --> 02:11:56,280
one of the best

7925
02:11:56,280 --> 02:11:57,560
men ever breathed

7926
02:11:57,680 --> 02:11:58,800
and the truest friend

7927
02:11:58,800 --> 02:11:59,900
I ever had.

7928
02:11:59,900 --> 02:12:00,840
And I can never be

7929
02:12:00,840 --> 02:12:02,220
in company with this Mr.

7930
02:12:02,220 --> 02:12:02,840
Darcy,

7931
02:12:02,840 --> 02:12:04,020
without being grieved

7932
02:12:04,020 --> 02:12:04,620
to the soul

7933
02:12:04,620 --> 02:12:05,420
by a thousand

7934
02:12:05,420 --> 02:12:06,560
tender recollections.

7935
02:12:08,220 --> 02:12:08,880
His behavior

7936
02:12:08,880 --> 02:12:09,720
to myself has

7937
02:12:09,720 --> 02:12:10,920
been scandalous.

7938
02:12:11,340 --> 02:12:12,380
But I verily believe

7939
02:12:12,380 --> 02:12:13,080
I could forgive him

7940
02:12:13,080 --> 02:12:14,160
anything and everything

7941
02:12:14,160 --> 02:12:14,700
rather than

7942
02:12:14,700 --> 02:12:15,480
his disappointing

7943
02:12:15,480 --> 02:12:15,960
the hopes

7944
02:12:15,960 --> 02:12:16,620
and disgracing

7945
02:12:16,620 --> 02:12:17,120
the memory

7946
02:12:17,120 --> 02:12:18,320
of his father.

7947
02:12:19,820 --> 02:12:20,340
Elizabeth

7948
02:12:20,340 --> 02:12:21,060
found the interest

7949
02:12:21,060 --> 02:12:22,260
of the subject increase

7950
02:12:22,500 --> 02:12:23,000
and listened

7951
02:12:23,000 --> 02:12:24,120
with all her heart,

7952
02:12:24,120 --> 02:12:25,380
but the delicacy of it

7953
02:12:25,380 --> 02:12:25,880
prevented

7954
02:12:25,880 --> 02:12:27,080
further inquiry.

7955
02:12:27,600 --> 02:12:27,920
Mr.

7956
02:12:27,920 --> 02:12:28,580
Wickham began

7957
02:12:28,580 --> 02:12:29,240
to speak on more

7958
02:12:29,240 --> 02:12:30,440
general topics

7959
02:12:30,600 --> 02:12:31,320
Meriton,

7960
02:12:31,320 --> 02:12:31,980
the neighborhood,

7961
02:12:31,980 --> 02:12:33,080
the society

7962
02:12:33,080 --> 02:12:34,400
appearing highly pleased

7963
02:12:34,400 --> 02:12:34,760
with all that

7964
02:12:34,760 --> 02:12:35,900
he had yet seen,

7965
02:12:35,900 --> 02:12:36,560
and speaking

7966
02:12:36,560 --> 02:12:37,160
of the latter,

7967
02:12:37,160 --> 02:12:37,760
with gentle

7968
02:12:37,760 --> 02:12:38,160
but very

7969
02:12:38,160 --> 02:12:39,500
intelligible gallantry.

7970
02:12:41,120 --> 02:12:42,080
It was the prospect

7971
02:12:42,080 --> 02:12:43,280
of constant society

7972
02:12:43,280 --> 02:12:44,340
and good society.

7973
02:12:44,340 --> 02:12:45,180
He added.

7974
02:12:45,180 --> 02:12:45,800
Which was my

7975
02:12:45,800 --> 02:12:46,680
chief inducement

7976
02:12:46,680 --> 02:12:47,880
to enter the shire.

7977
02:12:48,020 --> 02:12:48,600
I know

7978
02:12:48,600 --> 02:12:48,840
to be

7979
02:12:48,840 --> 02:12:49,880
a most respectable,

7980
02:12:49,880 --> 02:12:51,080
agreeable call

7981
02:12:51,800 --> 02:12:52,400
and my friend

7982
02:12:52,400 --> 02:12:53,820
Danny tempted me further

7983
02:12:53,820 --> 02:12:54,180
by his

7984
02:12:54,180 --> 02:12:54,800
account of their

7985
02:12:54,800 --> 02:12:56,000
present quarters

7986
02:12:56,640 --> 02:12:57,120
and the very

7987
02:12:57,120 --> 02:12:57,920
great attentions

7988
02:12:57,920 --> 02:12:58,560
and excellent

7989
02:12:58,560 --> 02:12:59,460
acquaintance Meriton

7990
02:12:59,460 --> 02:13:00,180
had procured them.

7991
02:13:01,740 --> 02:13:02,940
Society I own

7992
02:13:02,940 --> 02:13:04,160
is necessary to me.

7993
02:13:04,940 --> 02:13:05,400
I've been a

7994
02:13:05,400 --> 02:13:06,260
disappointed man

7995
02:13:06,260 --> 02:13:06,980
and my spirits

7996
02:13:06,980 --> 02:13:08,240
will not bear solitude.

7997
02:13:09,680 --> 02:13:10,760
I must have employment

7998
02:13:10,760 --> 02:13:11,960
and society.

7999
02:13:13,160 --> 02:13:14,060
A military life

8000
02:13:14,060 --> 02:13:14,480
is not what

8001
02:13:14,480 --> 02:13:15,680
I was intended for,

8002
02:13:16,020 --> 02:13:16,940
but circumstances

8003
02:13:16,940 --> 02:13:17,520
have now made it

8004
02:13:17,520 --> 02:13:18,260
eligible.

8005
02:13:18,260 --> 02:13:18,960
The church

8006
02:13:18,960 --> 02:13:20,180
ought to have been

8007
02:13:20,180 --> 02:13:21,200
my profession.

8008
02:13:21,200 --> 02:13:22,160
I was brought up for

8009
02:13:22,160 --> 02:13:22,920
the church,

8010
02:13:22,920 --> 02:13:23,480
and I should

8011
02:13:23,480 --> 02:13:24,060
at this time

8012
02:13:24,060 --> 02:13:24,860
have been in possession

8013
02:13:24,860 --> 02:13:25,220
of a most

8014
02:13:25,220 --> 02:13:26,420
valuable living.

8015
02:13:26,520 --> 02:13:27,140
Had it pleased

8016
02:13:27,140 --> 02:13:27,720
the gentleman

8017
02:13:27,720 --> 02:13:28,440
we were speaking of

8018
02:13:28,440 --> 02:13:29,640
just now.

8019
02:13:30,060 --> 02:13:31,260
Indeed.

8020
02:13:31,520 --> 02:13:31,980
Yes.

8021
02:13:31,980 --> 02:13:32,660
The late Mr.

8022
02:13:32,660 --> 02:13:33,560
D'Arcy bequeathed me

8023
02:13:33,560 --> 02:13:34,500
the next presentation

8024
02:13:34,500 --> 02:13:34,980
of the best

8025
02:13:34,980 --> 02:13:36,180
living and his gift.

8026
02:13:37,020 --> 02:13:38,060
He was my godfather

8027
02:13:38,060 --> 02:13:38,840
and excessively

8028
02:13:38,840 --> 02:13:40,040
attached to me.

8029
02:13:40,040 --> 02:13:41,040
I cannot do justice

8030
02:13:41,040 --> 02:13:42,240
to his kindness.

8031
02:13:42,260 --> 02:13:43,140
He meant to provide

8032
02:13:43,140 --> 02:13:43,860
for me amply

8033
02:13:43,860 --> 02:13:44,300
and thought

8034
02:13:44,300 --> 02:13:45,500
he had done it.

8035
02:13:45,680 --> 02:13:46,460
But when the living

8036
02:13:46,460 --> 02:13:48,360
fell, it was elsewhere.

8037
02:13:50,280 --> 02:13:51,480
Good heavens!

8038
02:13:51,620 --> 02:13:52,820
Cried Elizabeth.

8039
02:13:52,920 --> 02:13:54,120
But how could that be?

8040
02:13:54,420 --> 02:13:54,860
How could his

8041
02:13:54,860 --> 02:13:56,100
will be disregarded?

8042
02:13:56,640 --> 02:13:57,380
Why not?

8043
02:13:57,380 --> 02:13:58,700
You seek legal redress.

8044
02:13:59,400 --> 02:13:59,900
There was just

8045
02:13:59,900 --> 02:14:01,020
such an informality

8046
02:14:01,020 --> 02:14:01,580
in the terms

8047
02:14:01,580 --> 02:14:02,340
of the bequest

8048
02:14:02,340 --> 02:14:02,880
as to give me

8049
02:14:02,880 --> 02:14:04,080
no hope from law.

8050
02:14:05,820 --> 02:14:06,600
A man of honor

8051
02:14:06,600 --> 02:14:07,440
could have doubted

8052
02:14:07,440 --> 02:14:08,640
the intention.

8053
02:14:09,000 --> 02:14:09,440
But Mr.

8054
02:14:09,440 --> 02:14:10,640
D'Arcy chose to doubt it

8055
02:14:11,220 --> 02:14:12,020
or to treat it

8056
02:14:12,020 --> 02:14:12,500
as a merely

8057
02:14:12,500 --> 02:14:13,080
conditional

8058
02:14:13,080 --> 02:14:14,280
recommendation

8059
02:14:14,280 --> 02:14:15,120
and to assert that

8060
02:14:15,120 --> 02:14:16,020
I had forfeited

8061
02:14:16,020 --> 02:14:16,740
all claim

8062
02:14:16,740 --> 02:14:17,940
it by extravagance

8063
02:14:18,000 --> 02:14:18,680
imprudence.

8064
02:14:18,680 --> 02:14:20,180
In short, anything or

8065
02:14:20,180 --> 02:14:21,380
nothing

8066
02:14:21,900 --> 02:14:22,400
certain, it

8067
02:14:22,400 --> 02:14:23,060
is that the living

8068
02:14:23,060 --> 02:14:23,820
became vacant

8069
02:14:23,820 --> 02:14:25,020
two years ago

8070
02:14:25,100 --> 02:14:26,180
exactly as I was

8071
02:14:26,180 --> 02:14:27,380
of an age to hold it,

8072
02:14:27,780 --> 02:14:28,560
and that it was given

8073
02:14:28,560 --> 02:14:29,760
to another man

8074
02:14:29,940 --> 02:14:30,660
and no less

8075
02:14:30,660 --> 02:14:31,860
certain is it

8076
02:14:31,980 --> 02:14:32,600
that I cannot

8077
02:14:32,600 --> 02:14:33,500
accuse myself

8078
02:14:33,500 --> 02:14:33,900
of having

8079
02:14:33,900 --> 02:14:34,400
really done

8080
02:14:34,400 --> 02:14:34,860
anything to

8081
02:14:34,860 --> 02:14:35,820
deserve to lose it?

8082
02:14:36,860 --> 02:14:37,800
I have a warm,

8083
02:14:37,800 --> 02:14:39,000
unguarded temper

8084
02:14:39,660 --> 02:14:40,160
and I may

8085
02:14:40,160 --> 02:14:40,680
perhaps have

8086
02:14:40,680 --> 02:14:41,580
sometimes spoken

8087
02:14:41,580 --> 02:14:42,780
my opinion of him

8088
02:14:42,840 --> 02:14:44,580
and to him too freely.

8089
02:14:44,760 --> 02:14:45,440
I can recall

8090
02:14:45,440 --> 02:14:46,640
nothing worse.

8091
02:14:47,160 --> 02:14:48,360
But the fact is

8092
02:14:48,360 --> 02:14:48,720
that we are

8093
02:14:48,720 --> 02:14:49,320
very different

8094
02:14:49,320 --> 02:14:50,220
sort of men

8095
02:14:50,220 --> 02:14:51,420
and that he hates me.

8096
02:14:53,100 --> 02:14:54,500
This is quite shocking.

8097
02:14:54,840 --> 02:14:55,440
He desires

8098
02:14:55,440 --> 02:14:55,640
to be

8099
02:14:55,640 --> 02:14:57,060
publicly disgraced.

8100
02:14:58,140 --> 02:14:58,640
Sometime

8101
02:14:58,640 --> 02:14:59,840
or other he will be.

8102
02:15:00,020 --> 02:15:00,840
But it shall not be

8103
02:15:00,840 --> 02:15:02,040
by me

8104
02:15:02,660 --> 02:15:03,420
till I can forget

8105
02:15:03,420 --> 02:15:04,020
his father.

8106
02:15:04,020 --> 02:15:05,000
I can never defy

8107
02:15:05,000 --> 02:15:06,200
or expose him.

8108
02:15:07,020 --> 02:15:07,580
Elizabeth

8109
02:15:07,580 --> 02:15:08,120
honored him

8110
02:15:08,120 --> 02:15:09,300
for such feelings

8111
02:15:09,300 --> 02:15:09,900
and thought him

8112
02:15:09,900 --> 02:15:10,820
handsomer than ever

8113
02:15:10,820 --> 02:15:12,020
as he expressed them.

8114
02:15:12,440 --> 02:15:14,160
But what she said

8115
02:15:14,160 --> 02:15:15,360
after a pause.

8116
02:15:15,440 --> 02:15:16,860
Cannot be his motive.

8117
02:15:17,180 --> 02:15:18,000
What can have

8118
02:15:18,000 --> 02:15:19,220
induced him to behave so

8119
02:15:19,220 --> 02:15:20,420
cruelly?

8120
02:15:20,820 --> 02:15:22,160
A thorough, determined

8121
02:15:22,160 --> 02:15:23,360
dislike of me.

8122
02:15:24,440 --> 02:15:25,820
A dislike which I cannot

8123
02:15:25,820 --> 02:15:26,760
but attribute in

8124
02:15:26,760 --> 02:15:27,300
some measure

8125
02:15:27,300 --> 02:15:27,980
to jealousy.

8126
02:15:29,220 --> 02:15:30,120
Had the late Mr.

8127
02:15:30,120 --> 02:15:31,320
D'Arcy liked me less.

8128
02:15:31,460 --> 02:15:32,520
His son might have borne

8129
02:15:32,520 --> 02:15:33,720
with me better,

8130
02:15:34,320 --> 02:15:34,980
but his father's

8131
02:15:34,980 --> 02:15:35,960
uncommon attachment

8132
02:15:35,960 --> 02:15:37,020
to me irritated him,

8133
02:15:37,020 --> 02:15:38,040
I believe,

8134
02:15:38,040 --> 02:15:39,240
very early in life.

8135
02:15:40,520 --> 02:15:41,400
He had not a temper

8136
02:15:41,400 --> 02:15:41,760
to bear

8137
02:15:41,760 --> 02:15:42,740
the sort of competition

8138
02:15:42,740 --> 02:15:43,940
in which we stood,

8139
02:15:44,360 --> 02:15:45,320
the sort of preference

8140
02:15:45,320 --> 02:15:45,920
which was often

8141
02:15:45,920 --> 02:15:47,120
given me.

8142
02:15:48,660 --> 02:15:49,800
I had not thought Mr.

8143
02:15:49,800 --> 02:15:51,120
D'Arcy so bad as this,

8144
02:15:51,440 --> 02:15:51,620
though

8145
02:15:51,620 --> 02:15:52,820
I have never liked him.

8146
02:15:53,060 --> 02:15:54,120
I had not thought so

8147
02:15:54,120 --> 02:15:55,320
very ill of him.

8148
02:15:55,580 --> 02:15:56,520
I had supposed him to.

8149
02:15:56,520 --> 02:15:57,560
Be despising his fellow

8150
02:15:57,560 --> 02:15:57,980
creatures in.

8151
02:15:57,980 --> 02:15:58,760
General,

8152
02:15:58,760 --> 02:15:59,820
but did not suspect him

8153
02:15:59,820 --> 02:16:00,380
of descending

8154
02:16:00,380 --> 02:16:01,400
to such malicious

8155
02:16:01,400 --> 02:16:02,180
revenge.

8156
02:16:02,180 --> 02:16:03,380
Such injustice.

8157
02:16:03,420 --> 02:16:04,580
Such inhumanity

8158
02:16:04,580 --> 02:16:05,780
as this.

8159
02:16:06,300 --> 02:16:07,220
After a few minutes

8160
02:16:07,220 --> 02:16:08,040
reflection, however,

8161
02:16:08,040 --> 02:16:09,240
she continued.

8162
02:16:09,500 --> 02:16:10,280
I do remember

8163
02:16:10,280 --> 02:16:10,920
his boasting.

8164
02:16:10,920 --> 02:16:12,120
One day at Netherfield.

8165
02:16:12,300 --> 02:16:13,260
Of the implacable

8166
02:16:13,260 --> 02:16:13,520
city,

8167
02:16:13,520 --> 02:16:14,660
of his resentments.

8168
02:16:14,660 --> 02:16:15,500
Of his having

8169
02:16:15,500 --> 02:16:16,700
an unforgiving temper.

8170
02:16:17,180 --> 02:16:17,960
His disposition

8171
02:16:17,960 --> 02:16:19,160
must be dreadful.

8172
02:16:19,800 --> 02:16:21,060
I will not trust myself

8173
02:16:21,060 --> 02:16:21,980
on the subject.

8174
02:16:21,980 --> 02:16:23,180
Replied Wickham.

8175
02:16:23,220 --> 02:16:24,020
I can hardly be

8176
02:16:24,020 --> 02:16:24,720
just to him.

8177
02:16:25,700 --> 02:16:26,420
Elizabeth was

8178
02:16:26,420 --> 02:16:27,620
again, deep in thought

8179
02:16:27,860 --> 02:16:28,760
and after a time

8180
02:16:28,760 --> 02:16:29,960
exclaimed.

8181
02:16:30,680 --> 02:16:31,520
To treat in

8182
02:16:31,520 --> 02:16:32,360
such a manner

8183
02:16:32,360 --> 02:16:33,920
the godson, the friend,

8184
02:16:33,920 --> 02:16:34,520
the favorite

8185
02:16:34,520 --> 02:16:35,720
of his father.

8186
02:16:36,940 --> 02:16:38,160
She could added.

8187
02:16:38,360 --> 02:16:39,980
A young man to like you,

8188
02:16:40,200 --> 02:16:41,240
whose very countenance

8189
02:16:41,240 --> 02:16:41,720
may vouch

8190
02:16:41,720 --> 02:16:42,920
for your being amiable.

8191
02:16:43,520 --> 02:16:44,300
But she contented

8192
02:16:44,300 --> 02:16:44,720
herself.

8193
02:16:44,720 --> 02:16:46,400
With and one too,

8194
02:16:46,400 --> 02:16:47,200
would probably

8195
02:16:47,200 --> 02:16:47,860
his companion

8196
02:16:47,860 --> 02:16:48,900
from childhood.

8197
02:16:48,900 --> 02:16:49,820
Connected together.

8198
02:16:49,820 --> 02:16:50,200
As I think

8199
02:16:50,200 --> 02:16:50,720
you said, in the.

8200
02:16:50,720 --> 02:16:51,920
Closest manner.

8201
02:16:53,620 --> 02:16:54,280
We were born

8202
02:16:54,280 --> 02:16:55,260
in the same parish,

8203
02:16:55,260 --> 02:16:56,460
within the same park.

8204
02:16:57,260 --> 02:16:57,800
The greatest

8205
02:16:57,800 --> 02:16:58,500
part of our youth

8206
02:16:58,500 --> 02:16:59,700
was passed together.

8207
02:17:00,200 --> 02:17:00,700
Inmates

8208
02:17:00,700 --> 02:17:01,520
of the same house

8209
02:17:01,520 --> 02:17:02,060
sharing the

8210
02:17:02,060 --> 02:17:03,260
same amusements.

8211
02:17:03,660 --> 02:17:04,680
Objects of the same

8212
02:17:04,680 --> 02:17:05,880
parental care.

8213
02:17:06,420 --> 02:17:06,980
My father

8214
02:17:06,980 --> 02:17:07,520
began life

8215
02:17:07,520 --> 02:17:08,240
in the profession

8216
02:17:08,240 --> 02:17:09,280
which your uncle, Mr.

8217
02:17:09,280 --> 02:17:09,940
Phillips,

8218
02:17:09,940 --> 02:17:11,000
appears to do so much

8219
02:17:11,000 --> 02:17:11,820
credit to.

8220
02:17:11,820 --> 02:17:12,500
But he gave up

8221
02:17:12,500 --> 02:17:13,400
everything to be of use

8222
02:17:13,400 --> 02:17:14,120
to the late Mr.

8223
02:17:14,120 --> 02:17:15,320
D'Arcy,

8224
02:17:15,420 --> 02:17:16,640
and devoted his time

8225
02:17:16,640 --> 02:17:17,340
to the care of the

8226
02:17:17,340 --> 02:17:18,260
Pemberley property.

8227
02:17:19,400 --> 02:17:19,700
He was

8228
02:17:19,700 --> 02:17:20,200
most highly

8229
02:17:20,200 --> 02:17:21,080
esteemed by Mr.

8230
02:17:21,080 --> 02:17:22,680
Darcy, a most intimate,

8231
02:17:22,680 --> 02:17:23,880
confidential friend.

8232
02:17:24,700 --> 02:17:25,040
Mr.

8233
02:17:25,040 --> 02:17:25,820
Darcy, often

8234
02:17:25,820 --> 02:17:26,660
acknowledged himself

8235
02:17:26,660 --> 02:17:27,080
to be under

8236
02:17:27,080 --> 02:17:28,360
the greatest obligations

8237
02:17:28,360 --> 02:17:28,980
to my father's

8238
02:17:28,980 --> 02:17:30,280
active superintendence.

8239
02:17:32,060 --> 02:17:32,960
And when?

8240
02:17:32,960 --> 02:17:33,540
Immediately

8241
02:17:33,540 --> 02:17:34,460
before my father's

8242
02:17:34,460 --> 02:17:35,400
death, Mr.

8243
02:17:35,400 --> 02:17:36,180
Darcy gave him

8244
02:17:36,180 --> 02:17:37,080
a voluntary promise

8245
02:17:37,080 --> 02:17:38,280
of providing for me.

8246
02:17:39,260 --> 02:17:39,900
I am convinced

8247
02:17:39,900 --> 02:17:40,540
that he felt it

8248
02:17:40,540 --> 02:17:40,760
to be

8249
02:17:40,760 --> 02:17:41,420
as much a debt

8250
02:17:41,420 --> 02:17:42,620
of gratitude to him

8251
02:17:43,640 --> 02:17:44,400
as of affection

8252
02:17:44,400 --> 02:17:45,600
to myself.

8253
02:17:47,300 --> 02:17:48,500
How strange!

8254
02:17:48,700 --> 02:17:49,920
Cried Elizabeth.

8255
02:17:49,940 --> 02:17:51,200
How abominable.

8256
02:17:51,740 --> 02:17:52,920
I wonder that the very.

8257
02:17:52,920 --> 02:17:53,900
Pride of this Mr..

8258
02:17:53,900 --> 02:17:54,860
Darcy has not made him

8259
02:17:54,860 --> 02:17:56,060
just to you.

8260
02:17:56,120 --> 02:17:56,420
If from

8261
02:17:56,420 --> 02:17:57,620
no better motive,

8262
02:17:57,700 --> 02:17:58,400
that he should not

8263
02:17:58,400 --> 02:17:59,580
have been too proud

8264
02:17:59,580 --> 02:18:00,680
to be dishonest

8265
02:18:00,680 --> 02:18:01,460
for dishonesty,

8266
02:18:01,460 --> 02:18:02,660
I must call it.

8267
02:18:03,020 --> 02:18:04,220
It is wonderful.

8268
02:18:04,220 --> 02:18:05,340
Replied Wickham.

8269
02:18:05,340 --> 02:18:06,120
For almost all

8270
02:18:06,120 --> 02:18:06,700
his actions

8271
02:18:06,700 --> 02:18:07,920
may be traced to pride.

8272
02:18:08,480 --> 02:18:09,140
And pride has

8273
02:18:09,140 --> 02:18:09,800
often been his

8274
02:18:09,800 --> 02:18:10,440
best friend.

8275
02:18:11,700 --> 02:18:12,380
It is connected

8276
02:18:12,380 --> 02:18:12,840
him nearer

8277
02:18:12,840 --> 02:18:13,520
with virtue

8278
02:18:13,520 --> 02:18:14,720
than any other feeling.

8279
02:18:16,340 --> 02:18:17,120
But we are none of us

8280
02:18:17,120 --> 02:18:18,040
consistent

8281
02:18:18,040 --> 02:18:18,900
and in his behavior.

8282
02:18:18,900 --> 02:18:19,360
To me,

8283
02:18:19,360 --> 02:18:19,620
there were

8284
02:18:19,620 --> 02:18:20,580
stronger impulses

8285
02:18:20,580 --> 02:18:21,780
even than pride.

8286
02:18:23,660 --> 02:18:24,200
Can such

8287
02:18:24,200 --> 02:18:25,400
abominable pride

8288
02:18:25,400 --> 02:18:25,920
as hares

8289
02:18:25,920 --> 02:18:27,320
have ever done him good?

8290
02:18:28,020 --> 02:18:29,220
Yes.

8291
02:18:29,280 --> 02:18:29,820
It has often

8292
02:18:29,820 --> 02:18:30,800
led him to be liberal

8293
02:18:30,800 --> 02:18:32,000
and generous

8294
02:18:32,280 --> 02:18:33,080
to give his money

8295
02:18:33,080 --> 02:18:34,520
freely, to display

8296
02:18:34,520 --> 02:18:35,720
hospitality,

8297
02:18:36,080 --> 02:18:37,320
to assist his tenants

8298
02:18:37,320 --> 02:18:38,520
and relieve the poor

8299
02:18:39,320 --> 02:18:40,520
family pride

8300
02:18:40,640 --> 02:18:41,840
and filial pride,

8301
02:18:42,500 --> 02:18:43,540
for he is very proud

8302
02:18:43,540 --> 02:18:44,760
of what his father was.

8303
02:18:44,900 --> 02:18:46,100
Have done this

8304
02:18:47,520 --> 02:18:48,260
not to appear

8305
02:18:48,260 --> 02:18:49,520
to disgrace his family.

8306
02:18:50,240 --> 02:18:51,000
To degenerate

8307
02:18:51,000 --> 02:18:51,200
from the

8308
02:18:51,200 --> 02:18:52,400
popular qualities

8309
02:18:52,640 --> 02:18:53,720
or lose the influence

8310
02:18:53,720 --> 02:18:54,920
of the Pemberley house

8311
02:18:55,220 --> 02:18:56,480
is a powerful motive.

8312
02:18:57,500 --> 02:18:58,220
He has also

8313
02:18:58,220 --> 02:18:59,840
brotherly pride, which,

8314
02:18:59,840 --> 02:19:00,380
with some

8315
02:19:00,380 --> 02:19:01,520
brotherly affection,

8316
02:19:01,520 --> 02:19:02,540
makes him very kind

8317
02:19:02,540 --> 02:19:03,120
and careful

8318
02:19:03,120 --> 02:19:04,320
guardian of his sister.

8319
02:19:05,060 --> 02:19:05,860
And you will hear him

8320
02:19:05,860 --> 02:19:06,920
generally cried up

8321
02:19:06,920 --> 02:19:07,820
as the most attentive

8322
02:19:07,820 --> 02:19:08,940
and best of brothers.

8323
02:19:10,100 --> 02:19:10,740
What sort of

8324
02:19:10,740 --> 02:19:11,480
a girl is Mr.

8325
02:19:11,480 --> 02:19:12,680
Darcy?

8326
02:19:13,400 --> 02:19:14,600
He shook his head.

8327
02:19:15,020 --> 02:19:15,900
I wish I could call her

8328
02:19:15,900 --> 02:19:17,100
amiable.

8329
02:19:17,180 --> 02:19:17,960
It gives me pain

8330
02:19:17,960 --> 02:19:19,320
to speak ill of a Darcy.

8331
02:19:19,460 --> 02:19:20,620
But she is too much like

8332
02:19:20,620 --> 02:19:21,200
her brother.

8333
02:19:21,200 --> 02:19:22,400
Very, very proud.

8334
02:19:23,280 --> 02:19:24,000
As a child,

8335
02:19:24,000 --> 02:19:24,860
she was affectionate

8336
02:19:24,860 --> 02:19:25,460
and pleasing

8337
02:19:25,460 --> 02:19:26,280
and extremely

8338
02:19:26,280 --> 02:19:27,180
fond of me.

8339
02:19:27,180 --> 02:19:28,580
And I have devoted hours

8340
02:19:28,580 --> 02:19:29,180
and hours

8341
02:19:29,180 --> 02:19:30,380
to her amusement.

8342
02:19:30,380 --> 02:19:30,840
But she is

8343
02:19:30,840 --> 02:19:32,040
nothing to me now.

8344
02:19:32,600 --> 02:19:33,380
She is a handsome

8345
02:19:33,380 --> 02:19:34,980
girl, about 15 or 16.

8346
02:19:34,980 --> 02:19:35,860
And I understand.

8347
02:19:35,860 --> 02:19:37,080
Highly accomplished.

8348
02:19:37,780 --> 02:19:38,160
Since her

8349
02:19:38,160 --> 02:19:38,780
father's death,

8350
02:19:38,780 --> 02:19:39,240
her home

8351
02:19:39,240 --> 02:19:39,940
has been London,

8352
02:19:39,940 --> 02:19:41,060
where a lady lives with

8353
02:19:41,060 --> 02:19:41,860
and superintend

8354
02:19:41,860 --> 02:19:43,080
her education.

8355
02:19:44,520 --> 02:19:45,680
After many pauses

8356
02:19:45,680 --> 02:19:46,400
and many trials

8357
02:19:46,400 --> 02:19:47,600
of other subjects.

8358
02:19:47,700 --> 02:19:48,560
Elizabeth could not

8359
02:19:48,560 --> 02:19:49,160
help, reverting

8360
02:19:49,160 --> 02:19:50,200
once more to the first

8361
02:19:50,200 --> 02:19:51,420
and saying.

8362
02:19:51,500 --> 02:19:52,460
I am astonished

8363
02:19:52,460 --> 02:19:53,600
at his intimacy with Mr.

8364
02:19:53,600 --> 02:19:54,620
Bingley.

8365
02:19:54,620 --> 02:19:55,260
How can Mr.

8366
02:19:55,260 --> 02:19:56,620
Bingley, who seems good

8367
02:19:56,620 --> 02:19:57,740
humor itself

8368
02:19:57,740 --> 02:19:58,200
and is,

8369
02:19:58,200 --> 02:19:58,860
I really believe,

8370
02:19:58,860 --> 02:20:00,060
truly amiable

8371
02:20:00,200 --> 02:20:01,980
being with such a man.

8372
02:20:02,300 --> 02:20:03,200
How can they suit

8373
02:20:03,200 --> 02:20:04,280
each other?

8374
02:20:04,280 --> 02:20:05,040
Do you know Mr.

8375
02:20:05,040 --> 02:20:06,240
Bingley?

8376
02:20:06,280 --> 02:20:07,500
Not at all.

8377
02:20:07,760 --> 02:20:08,720
He is a sweet

8378
02:20:08,720 --> 02:20:09,200
tempered,

8379
02:20:09,200 --> 02:20:10,620
amiable, charming man.

8380
02:20:11,180 --> 02:20:12,280
He cannot know what Mr.

8381
02:20:12,280 --> 02:20:13,160
Darcy is.

8382
02:20:14,240 --> 02:20:15,440
Probably not.

8383
02:20:15,440 --> 02:20:15,860
But Mr.

8384
02:20:15,860 --> 02:20:16,760
Darcy can please

8385
02:20:16,760 --> 02:20:17,820
where he chooses.

8386
02:20:17,820 --> 02:20:18,280
He does not

8387
02:20:18,280 --> 02:20:19,500
want abilities.

8388
02:20:19,500 --> 02:20:20,000
He can be

8389
02:20:20,000 --> 02:20:21,320
a convertible companion

8390
02:20:21,320 --> 02:20:21,900
if he thinks it

8391
02:20:21,900 --> 02:20:23,100
worth his while.

8392
02:20:23,420 --> 02:20:24,120
Among those

8393
02:20:24,120 --> 02:20:24,700
who are at all

8394
02:20:24,700 --> 02:20:25,220
his equals.

8395
02:20:25,220 --> 02:20:26,420
In consequence,

8396
02:20:26,780 --> 02:20:27,320
he is a very

8397
02:20:27,320 --> 02:20:28,080
different man

8398
02:20:28,080 --> 02:20:28,400
from what

8399
02:20:28,400 --> 02:20:28,700
he is

8400
02:20:28,700 --> 02:20:29,900
to the less prosperous.

8401
02:20:30,600 --> 02:20:31,220
His pride

8402
02:20:31,220 --> 02:20:32,420
never deserts him,

8403
02:20:32,960 --> 02:20:33,840
but with the rich,

8404
02:20:33,840 --> 02:20:35,040
he is liberal minded,

8405
02:20:35,040 --> 02:20:36,240
just sincere,

8406
02:20:36,380 --> 02:20:37,680
rational, honorable

8407
02:20:37,680 --> 02:20:38,880
and perhaps agreeable,

8408
02:20:39,140 --> 02:20:40,100
allowing something

8409
02:20:40,100 --> 02:20:41,360
for fortune and figure.

8410
02:20:42,200 --> 02:20:43,020
The West Party.

8411
02:20:43,020 --> 02:20:43,760
Soon afterwards,

8412
02:20:43,760 --> 02:20:44,600
breaking up,

8413
02:20:44,600 --> 02:20:45,620
the players gathered

8414
02:20:45,620 --> 02:20:46,820
round the other table,

8415
02:20:46,820 --> 02:20:47,280
and Mr.

8416
02:20:47,280 --> 02:20:48,440
Collins took his station

8417
02:20:48,440 --> 02:20:49,160
between his cousin

8418
02:20:49,160 --> 02:20:50,360
Elizabeth and Mrs..

8419
02:20:51,000 --> 02:20:52,040
The usual inquiries

8420
02:20:52,040 --> 02:20:53,000
as to his success

8421
02:20:53,000 --> 02:20:54,200
was made by the latter.

8422
02:20:54,540 --> 02:20:55,340
It had not been

8423
02:20:55,340 --> 02:20:56,200
very great.

8424
02:20:56,200 --> 02:20:57,600
He had lost every point.

8425
02:20:57,840 --> 02:20:58,520
But when Mrs.

8426
02:20:58,520 --> 02:20:59,180
Phillips began

8427
02:20:59,180 --> 02:20:59,780
to express her

8428
02:20:59,780 --> 02:21:00,980
concern, thereupon

8429
02:21:01,160 --> 02:21:02,360
he assured her with much

8430
02:21:02,360 --> 02:21:03,540
earnest gravity,

8431
02:21:03,540 --> 02:21:04,160
that it was not

8432
02:21:04,160 --> 02:21:05,360
of the least importance

8433
02:21:05,440 --> 02:21:06,120
that he considered

8434
02:21:06,120 --> 02:21:06,480
the money

8435
02:21:06,480 --> 02:21:07,580
as a mere trifle,

8436
02:21:07,580 --> 02:21:08,200
and begged

8437
02:21:08,200 --> 02:21:08,580
that she would

8438
02:21:08,580 --> 02:21:09,380
not make herself.

8439
02:21:11,420 --> 02:21:12,620
I know very well, madam.

8440
02:21:13,020 --> 02:21:13,880
Said he.

8441
02:21:13,880 --> 02:21:14,700
That when persons

8442
02:21:14,700 --> 02:21:15,180
sit down

8443
02:21:15,180 --> 02:21:16,360
to a card table,

8444
02:21:16,360 --> 02:21:17,000
they must take

8445
02:21:17,000 --> 02:21:17,520
their chance

8446
02:21:17,520 --> 02:21:18,500
of these things

8447
02:21:18,500 --> 02:21:19,100
and happily

8448
02:21:19,100 --> 02:21:19,760
I am not in

8449
02:21:19,760 --> 02:21:20,820
such circumstances

8450
02:21:20,820 --> 02:21:21,260
as to make

8451
02:21:21,260 --> 02:21:22,120
five shillings

8452
02:21:22,120 --> 02:21:23,340
any object.

8453
02:21:23,780 --> 02:21:24,180
There are

8454
02:21:24,180 --> 02:21:25,280
undoubtedly many

8455
02:21:25,280 --> 02:21:25,780
who could not

8456
02:21:25,780 --> 02:21:27,000
say the same.

8457
02:21:27,660 --> 02:21:28,520
But thanks to Lady

8458
02:21:28,520 --> 02:21:29,620
Catherine de Borg,

8459
02:21:29,620 --> 02:21:30,740
I am removed far

8460
02:21:30,740 --> 02:21:31,780
beyond the necessity

8461
02:21:31,780 --> 02:21:32,400
of regarding

8462
02:21:32,400 --> 02:21:33,600
little matters.

8463
02:21:34,920 --> 02:21:35,280
Mr.

8464
02:21:35,280 --> 02:21:35,660
Wickham's

8465
02:21:35,660 --> 02:21:36,860
attention was caught

8466
02:21:36,920 --> 02:21:38,160
and after observing Mr.

8467
02:21:38,160 --> 02:21:38,600
Collins

8468
02:21:38,600 --> 02:21:39,680
for a few moments.

8469
02:21:39,680 --> 02:21:40,700
He asked Elizabeth.

8470
02:21:40,700 --> 02:21:41,420
In a low voice

8471
02:21:41,420 --> 02:21:42,240
whether her relation

8472
02:21:42,240 --> 02:21:43,100
was very intimately

8473
02:21:43,100 --> 02:21:43,540
acquainted

8474
02:21:43,540 --> 02:21:44,360
with the family of De.

8475
02:21:44,360 --> 02:21:45,560
Berg,

8476
02:21:45,700 --> 02:21:47,200
Lady Catherine de Berg.

8477
02:21:47,400 --> 02:21:48,500
She replied.

8478
02:21:48,500 --> 02:21:49,260
Has very lately

8479
02:21:49,260 --> 02:21:50,440
given him a living.

8480
02:21:50,440 --> 02:21:51,560
I hardly know how Mr.

8481
02:21:51,560 --> 02:21:52,360
Collins was first

8482
02:21:52,360 --> 02:21:52,920
introduced to

8483
02:21:52,920 --> 02:21:54,000
her notice.

8484
02:21:54,000 --> 02:21:54,980
But he certainly has

8485
02:21:54,980 --> 02:21:56,180
not known how long.

8486
02:21:56,820 --> 02:21:57,200
You know,

8487
02:21:57,200 --> 02:21:57,660
of course,

8488
02:21:57,660 --> 02:21:58,080
that lady

8489
02:21:58,080 --> 02:21:58,940
Catherine de Borg

8490
02:21:58,940 --> 02:21:59,440
and Lady

8491
02:21:59,440 --> 02:22:00,700
and Darcy were sisters.

8492
02:22:00,900 --> 02:22:01,520
Consequently,

8493
02:22:01,520 --> 02:22:02,420
that she is aunt

8494
02:22:02,420 --> 02:22:03,080
to the present.

8495
02:22:03,080 --> 02:22:03,860
Mr. Darcy?

8496
02:22:05,300 --> 02:22:06,180
No, indeed,

8497
02:22:06,180 --> 02:22:07,360
I did not.

8498
02:22:07,360 --> 02:22:07,860
I knew

8499
02:22:07,860 --> 02:22:08,960
nothing at all of Lady

8500
02:22:08,960 --> 02:22:10,160
Katherine's connections.

8501
02:22:10,400 --> 02:22:11,040
I never heard

8502
02:22:11,040 --> 02:22:11,780
of her existence

8503
02:22:11,780 --> 02:22:12,180
till the day

8504
02:22:12,180 --> 02:22:13,380
before yesterday.

8505
02:22:14,120 --> 02:22:15,020
Her daughter, Mr.

8506
02:22:15,020 --> 02:22:15,360
Borg,

8507
02:22:15,360 --> 02:22:15,680
will have

8508
02:22:15,680 --> 02:22:16,920
a very large fortune.

8509
02:22:16,920 --> 02:22:17,900
And it is believed

8510
02:22:17,900 --> 02:22:19,220
that she and her cousin

8511
02:22:19,220 --> 02:22:20,060
will unite the

8512
02:22:20,060 --> 02:22:21,260
two estates.

8513
02:22:22,540 --> 02:22:23,420
This information

8514
02:22:23,420 --> 02:22:24,620
made Elizabeth smile

8515
02:22:24,740 --> 02:22:25,820
as she thought of poor

8516
02:22:25,820 --> 02:22:27,000
Miss Bingley.

8517
02:22:27,000 --> 02:22:27,900
Vain, indeed

8518
02:22:27,900 --> 02:22:28,460
must be all

8519
02:22:28,460 --> 02:22:29,480
her attentions,

8520
02:22:29,480 --> 02:22:30,600
vain and useless.

8521
02:22:30,600 --> 02:22:31,200
Her affection

8522
02:22:31,200 --> 02:22:31,980
for his sister

8523
02:22:31,980 --> 02:22:32,180
and her

8524
02:22:32,180 --> 02:22:33,380
praise of himself

8525
02:22:33,480 --> 02:22:34,580
if he were already self

8526
02:22:34,580 --> 02:22:35,860
destined for another.

8527
02:22:36,980 --> 02:22:37,340
Mr.

8528
02:22:37,340 --> 02:22:38,440
Collins said.

8529
02:22:38,440 --> 02:22:40,080
She speaks highly,

8530
02:22:40,080 --> 02:22:41,040
both of Lady Catherine

8531
02:22:41,040 --> 02:22:42,240
and her daughter,

8532
02:22:42,560 --> 02:22:43,780
but in some particulars

8533
02:22:43,780 --> 02:22:44,120
that he is

8534
02:22:44,120 --> 02:22:45,320
related of her Ladyship.

8535
02:22:45,660 --> 02:22:47,100
I suspect his gratitude

8536
02:22:47,100 --> 02:22:48,380
misleads him and.

8537
02:22:48,380 --> 02:22:49,280
That in spite of her

8538
02:22:49,280 --> 02:22:49,680
being his.

8539
02:22:49,680 --> 02:22:50,580
Patroness,

8540
02:22:50,580 --> 02:22:51,600
she is an arrogant,

8541
02:22:51,600 --> 02:22:52,800
conceited woman.

8542
02:22:53,340 --> 02:22:54,180
I believe her to be

8543
02:22:54,180 --> 02:22:55,400
both in a great degree,

8544
02:22:55,540 --> 02:22:56,720
replied Wickham.

8545
02:22:56,720 --> 02:22:57,600
I have not seen her

8546
02:22:57,600 --> 02:22:58,580
for many years,

8547
02:22:58,580 --> 02:22:59,820
but I very well remember

8548
02:22:59,820 --> 02:23:01,020
that I never liked her

8549
02:23:01,080 --> 02:23:01,860
and that her manners

8550
02:23:01,860 --> 02:23:02,780
were dictatorial

8551
02:23:02,780 --> 02:23:03,980
and insolent.

8552
02:23:04,400 --> 02:23:05,720
She has the reputation

8553
02:23:05,720 --> 02:23:06,800
of being remarkably

8554
02:23:06,800 --> 02:23:08,060
sensible and clever,

8555
02:23:08,400 --> 02:23:09,360
but I rather believe

8556
02:23:09,360 --> 02:23:10,020
she derives

8557
02:23:10,020 --> 02:23:11,000
part of her abilities

8558
02:23:11,000 --> 02:23:11,620
from her rank

8559
02:23:11,620 --> 02:23:12,480
and fortune,

8560
02:23:12,480 --> 02:23:12,740
apart

8561
02:23:12,740 --> 02:23:13,100
from her

8562
02:23:13,100 --> 02:23:14,300
authoritative manner

8563
02:23:14,420 --> 02:23:15,320
and the rest from the

8564
02:23:15,320 --> 02:23:16,520
pride of her nephew

8565
02:23:16,760 --> 02:23:17,580
who chooses

8566
02:23:17,580 --> 02:23:18,500
everyone connected

8567
02:23:18,500 --> 02:23:18,840
with him

8568
02:23:18,840 --> 02:23:19,280
should have

8569
02:23:19,280 --> 02:23:20,120
an understanding of

8570
02:23:20,120 --> 02:23:21,080
the first class.

8571
02:23:22,680 --> 02:23:23,520
Elizabeth allowed

8572
02:23:23,520 --> 02:23:24,040
that he had given

8573
02:23:24,040 --> 02:23:24,280
a very

8574
02:23:24,280 --> 02:23:25,500
rational account of it.

8575
02:23:25,700 --> 02:23:26,420
And they continued

8576
02:23:26,420 --> 02:23:26,840
talking.

8577
02:23:26,840 --> 02:23:27,320
Together

8578
02:23:27,320 --> 02:23:28,760
with mutual satisfaction

8579
02:23:29,040 --> 02:23:29,620
till supper,

8580
02:23:29,620 --> 02:23:30,840
put an end to cards

8581
02:23:31,020 --> 02:23:31,820
and gave the rest

8582
02:23:31,820 --> 02:23:32,400
of the ladies

8583
02:23:32,400 --> 02:23:33,200
their share of Mr.

8584
02:23:33,200 --> 02:23:34,400
Wickham's attentions.

8585
02:23:34,740 --> 02:23:35,200
There could be.

8586
02:23:35,200 --> 02:23:36,240
No conversation in the.

8587
02:23:36,240 --> 02:23:36,860
Noise of Mrs.

8588
02:23:36,860 --> 02:23:38,060
Phillips supper party,

8589
02:23:38,180 --> 02:23:38,960
but his manners

8590
02:23:38,960 --> 02:23:39,600
recommended him

8591
02:23:39,600 --> 02:23:40,740
to everybody.

8592
02:23:40,740 --> 02:23:41,700
Whatever he said

8593
02:23:41,700 --> 02:23:42,900
was well said,

8594
02:23:42,940 --> 02:23:44,100
and whatever he did

8595
02:23:44,100 --> 02:23:45,300
done gracefully.

8596
02:23:45,700 --> 02:23:46,820
Elizabeth went away

8597
02:23:46,820 --> 02:23:47,400
with, her head

8598
02:23:47,400 --> 02:23:48,420
full of him.

8599
02:23:48,420 --> 02:23:48,940
She could think

8600
02:23:48,940 --> 02:23:49,880
of nothing but of Mr.

8601
02:23:49,880 --> 02:23:50,440
Wickham.

8602
02:23:50,440 --> 02:23:50,760
And of.

8603
02:23:50,760 --> 02:23:51,680
What he had told her

8604
02:23:51,680 --> 02:23:52,880
all the way home.

8605
02:23:52,880 --> 02:23:53,840
But there was not time

8606
02:23:53,840 --> 02:23:54,120
for her

8607
02:23:54,120 --> 02:23:55,160
even to mention his name

8608
02:23:55,160 --> 02:23:56,100
as they went

8609
02:23:56,100 --> 02:23:57,140
for neither Lydia.

8610
02:23:57,140 --> 02:23:57,420
Mr.

8611
02:23:57,420 --> 02:23:58,020
Collins were

8612
02:23:58,020 --> 02:23:59,220
once silent.

8613
02:23:59,280 --> 02:24:00,080
Lydia talked

8614
02:24:00,080 --> 02:24:01,320
incessantly of lottery

8615
02:24:01,320 --> 02:24:02,520
tickets of the fish

8616
02:24:02,520 --> 02:24:03,180
she had lost

8617
02:24:03,180 --> 02:24:03,560
and the fish

8618
02:24:03,560 --> 02:24:04,400
she had won.

8619
02:24:04,400 --> 02:24:04,860
And Mr.

8620
02:24:04,860 --> 02:24:05,820
Collins, in describing

8621
02:24:05,820 --> 02:24:06,740
the civility of Mr.

8622
02:24:06,740 --> 02:24:07,820
and Mrs. Phillips.

8623
02:24:07,820 --> 02:24:08,660
Protesting that he did.

8624
02:24:08,660 --> 02:24:09,240
Not in the least

8625
02:24:09,240 --> 02:24:09,700
regard his.

8626
02:24:09,700 --> 02:24:10,780
Losses at whist.

8627
02:24:10,780 --> 02:24:11,720
Enumerating all

8628
02:24:11,720 --> 02:24:12,920
the dishes at supper.

8629
02:24:12,940 --> 02:24:14,060
And repeatedly fearing

8630
02:24:14,060 --> 02:24:14,700
that he crowded

8631
02:24:14,700 --> 02:24:15,620
his cousins.

8632
02:24:15,620 --> 02:24:16,320
Had more to say

8633
02:24:16,320 --> 02:24:16,640
than he could

8634
02:24:16,640 --> 02:24:17,240
well manage

8635
02:24:17,240 --> 02:24:18,000
before the carriage

8636
02:24:18,000 --> 02:24:18,700
stopped at

8637
02:24:18,700 --> 02:24:19,700
Longhorn House.

8638
02:24:21,560 --> 02:24:22,760
Chapter 17.

8639
02:24:24,380 --> 02:24:25,440
Elizabeth Related

8640
02:24:25,440 --> 02:24:26,780
to Jane the next day

8641
02:24:26,780 --> 02:24:27,500
what had passed

8642
02:24:27,500 --> 02:24:28,120
between Mr.

8643
02:24:28,120 --> 02:24:29,340
Wickham and herself.

8644
02:24:29,600 --> 02:24:30,500
Jane listened

8645
02:24:30,500 --> 02:24:31,440
with astonishment

8646
02:24:31,440 --> 02:24:32,640
and concern.

8647
02:24:32,780 --> 02:24:33,560
She knew not

8648
02:24:33,560 --> 02:24:34,820
how to believe that Mr.

8649
02:24:34,820 --> 02:24:35,540
Darcy could be

8650
02:24:35,540 --> 02:24:36,900
so unworthy of Mr.

8651
02:24:36,900 --> 02:24:38,100
Bailey's regard.

8652
02:24:38,280 --> 02:24:38,940
And yet

8653
02:24:38,940 --> 02:24:40,120
it was not in her nature

8654
02:24:40,120 --> 02:24:41,400
to question the veracity

8655
02:24:41,400 --> 02:24:42,020
of a young man

8656
02:24:42,020 --> 02:24:42,360
of such

8657
02:24:42,360 --> 02:24:43,400
amiable appearance

8658
02:24:43,400 --> 02:24:44,600
as Wickham.

8659
02:24:44,660 --> 02:24:45,660
The possibility

8660
02:24:45,660 --> 02:24:46,760
of his having endured

8661
02:24:46,760 --> 02:24:48,080
such unkindness

8662
02:24:48,360 --> 02:24:49,440
was enough to interest

8663
02:24:49,440 --> 02:24:50,780
all her tender feelings,

8664
02:24:51,140 --> 02:24:52,160
and nothing remained

8665
02:24:52,160 --> 02:24:53,360
therefore to be done,

8666
02:24:53,420 --> 02:24:54,040
but to think

8667
02:24:54,040 --> 02:24:55,260
well of them both,

8668
02:24:55,360 --> 02:24:56,780
to defend the conduct

8669
02:24:56,780 --> 02:24:58,100
of each and throw

8670
02:24:58,100 --> 02:24:58,760
into the account

8671
02:24:58,760 --> 02:25:00,140
of accident or mistake,

8672
02:25:00,280 --> 02:25:00,900
whatever could

8673
02:25:00,900 --> 02:25:01,940
not be otherwise

8674
02:25:01,940 --> 02:25:03,140
explained.

8675
02:25:03,620 --> 02:25:05,520
They have both said

8676
02:25:05,520 --> 02:25:07,440
she been deceived.

8677
02:25:07,440 --> 02:25:08,940
I daresay in some way

8678
02:25:08,940 --> 02:25:09,680
or other

8679
02:25:09,680 --> 02:25:10,700
of which we can form.

8680
02:25:10,700 --> 02:25:11,900
No idea.

8681
02:25:12,080 --> 02:25:13,400
Interested people have

8682
02:25:13,400 --> 02:25:14,660
perhaps misrepresented

8683
02:25:14,660 --> 02:25:15,860
each to the other.

8684
02:25:16,220 --> 02:25:17,280
It is, in short,

8685
02:25:17,280 --> 02:25:18,000
impossible

8686
02:25:18,000 --> 02:25:19,040
for us to conjecture

8687
02:25:19,040 --> 02:25:19,760
the causes

8688
02:25:19,760 --> 02:25:21,000
or circumstances

8689
02:25:21,000 --> 02:25:21,420
which may have

8690
02:25:21,420 --> 02:25:22,540
alienated them

8691
02:25:22,540 --> 02:25:23,780
without actual blame

8692
02:25:23,780 --> 02:25:24,980
on either side.

8693
02:25:25,500 --> 02:25:26,780
Very true indeed.

8694
02:25:27,280 --> 02:25:28,220
And now, my dear

8695
02:25:28,220 --> 02:25:28,620
Jane,

8696
02:25:28,620 --> 02:25:29,860
what have you got to on

8697
02:25:29,860 --> 02:25:30,940
behalf of the interested

8698
02:25:30,940 --> 02:25:31,280
people

8699
02:25:31,280 --> 02:25:31,500
who have

8700
02:25:31,500 --> 02:25:32,600
probably been concerned

8701
02:25:32,600 --> 02:25:33,700
in the business?

8702
02:25:33,700 --> 02:25:35,060
Do you clear them too?

8703
02:25:35,240 --> 02:25:36,440
Or we shall be obliged

8704
02:25:36,440 --> 02:25:37,840
to think of somebody

8705
02:25:38,480 --> 02:25:39,380
love as

8706
02:25:39,380 --> 02:25:40,400
as you choose.

8707
02:25:40,400 --> 02:25:41,300
But you will not

8708
02:25:41,300 --> 02:25:41,840
laugh me

8709
02:25:41,840 --> 02:25:43,040
out of my opinion.

8710
02:25:43,520 --> 02:25:44,660
My dearest Lizzie.

8711
02:25:44,660 --> 02:25:46,320
But do consider in what

8712
02:25:46,320 --> 02:25:47,540
a disgraceful light

8713
02:25:47,540 --> 02:25:48,380
it pleases. Mr.

8714
02:25:48,380 --> 02:25:49,340
Darcy

8715
02:25:49,340 --> 02:25:50,060
to be treating

8716
02:25:50,060 --> 02:25:51,180
his father's favorite

8717
02:25:51,180 --> 02:25:52,380
in such a manner.

8718
02:25:52,460 --> 02:25:53,580
One whom his father.

8719
02:25:53,580 --> 02:25:54,180
Had promised

8720
02:25:54,180 --> 02:25:55,380
to provide for.

8721
02:25:55,680 --> 02:25:56,880
It is impossible.

8722
02:25:57,420 --> 02:25:58,280
No man of

8723
02:25:58,280 --> 02:25:59,580
common humanity,

8724
02:25:59,860 --> 02:26:01,980
no man who had any value

8725
02:26:01,980 --> 02:26:03,180
for his character

8726
02:26:03,260 --> 02:26:04,640
could be capable of it.

8727
02:26:05,160 --> 02:26:06,040
Can his most

8728
02:26:06,040 --> 02:26:06,920
intimate friends

8729
02:26:06,920 --> 02:26:07,860
be so excessively

8730
02:26:07,860 --> 02:26:09,060
deceived in?

8731
02:26:09,280 --> 02:26:10,500
Oh, no.

8732
02:26:11,060 --> 02:26:12,420
I can much more easily

8733
02:26:12,420 --> 02:26:12,920
believe Mr.

8734
02:26:12,920 --> 02:26:13,340
Bingley is

8735
02:26:13,340 --> 02:26:14,540
being imposed on

8736
02:26:14,620 --> 02:26:15,280
then that Mr.

8737
02:26:15,280 --> 02:26:15,660
Wickham

8738
02:26:15,660 --> 02:26:16,080
should invent

8739
02:26:16,080 --> 02:26:16,760
such a history

8740
02:26:16,760 --> 02:26:17,240
of himself

8741
02:26:17,240 --> 02:26:17,780
as he gave me

8742
02:26:17,780 --> 02:26:18,980
last night.

8743
02:26:19,160 --> 02:26:19,920
Names,

8744
02:26:19,920 --> 02:26:21,140
facts, everything.

8745
02:26:21,140 --> 02:26:21,900
Mentioned without.

8746
02:26:21,900 --> 02:26:23,100
Ceremony.

8747
02:26:23,160 --> 02:26:24,780
If it be not so, let Mr.

8748
02:26:24,780 --> 02:26:25,980
Darcy contradict it.

8749
02:26:26,580 --> 02:26:27,240
Besides,

8750
02:26:27,240 --> 02:26:27,920
there was truth

8751
02:26:27,920 --> 02:26:29,120
in looks.

8752
02:26:29,620 --> 02:26:30,540
It is difficult.

8753
02:26:30,540 --> 02:26:31,540
Indeed,

8754
02:26:31,540 --> 02:26:32,960
it is distressing.

8755
02:26:33,380 --> 02:26:34,160
One does not know

8756
02:26:34,160 --> 02:26:35,360
what to think.

8757
02:26:35,720 --> 02:26:37,020
I beg your pardon?

8758
02:26:37,040 --> 02:26:39,000
One knows what to think.

8759
02:26:39,840 --> 02:26:41,000
But Jane could think

8760
02:26:41,000 --> 02:26:41,700
with certainty

8761
02:26:41,700 --> 02:26:42,540
on only one.

8762
02:26:42,540 --> 02:26:43,360
Point.

8763
02:26:43,360 --> 02:26:43,940
That Mr.

8764
02:26:43,940 --> 02:26:44,620
Bingley.

8765
02:26:44,620 --> 02:26:45,980
If he had been imposed

8766
02:26:45,980 --> 02:26:46,920
on, would have.

8767
02:26:46,920 --> 02:26:47,780
Much to suffer

8768
02:26:47,780 --> 02:26:48,480
when the affair

8769
02:26:48,480 --> 02:26:49,620
became public.

8770
02:26:49,620 --> 02:26:50,600
The two young ladies.

8771
02:26:50,600 --> 02:26:51,020
Were summoned

8772
02:26:51,020 --> 02:26:51,780
from the shrubbery,

8773
02:26:51,780 --> 02:26:52,120
where this

8774
02:26:52,120 --> 02:26:53,340
conversation passed

8775
02:26:53,440 --> 02:26:54,260
by the arrival

8776
02:26:54,260 --> 02:26:55,280
of the very persons

8777
02:26:55,280 --> 02:26:55,980
of whom they had been.

8778
02:26:55,980 --> 02:26:57,280
Speaking. Mr.

8779
02:26:57,280 --> 02:26:58,580
Bingley and his sisters

8780
02:26:58,580 --> 02:26:59,180
came to give

8781
02:26:59,180 --> 02:26:59,820
their personal

8782
02:26:59,820 --> 02:27:00,480
invitation

8783
02:27:00,480 --> 02:27:01,540
for the long expected

8784
02:27:01,540 --> 02:27:02,760
ball at Netherfield,

8785
02:27:02,900 --> 02:27:03,660
which was fixed

8786
02:27:03,660 --> 02:27:03,860
for the

8787
02:27:03,860 --> 02:27:05,060
following Tuesday.

8788
02:27:05,400 --> 02:27:06,180
The two ladies

8789
02:27:06,180 --> 02:27:06,780
were delighted

8790
02:27:06,780 --> 02:27:07,360
to see their dear

8791
02:27:07,360 --> 02:27:08,280
friend again,

8792
02:27:08,280 --> 02:27:09,380
called it an age

8793
02:27:09,380 --> 02:27:09,860
since they had.

8794
02:27:09,860 --> 02:27:10,360
Met

8795
02:27:10,360 --> 02:27:11,540
and repeatedly asked.

8796
02:27:11,540 --> 02:27:11,960
What she had

8797
02:27:11,960 --> 02:27:12,900
been doing with herself

8798
02:27:12,900 --> 02:27:13,280
since their.

8799
02:27:13,280 --> 02:27:14,480
Separation.

8800
02:27:14,520 --> 02:27:15,200
To the rest of

8801
02:27:15,200 --> 02:27:15,700
the family.

8802
02:27:15,700 --> 02:27:16,120
They paid

8803
02:27:16,120 --> 02:27:17,280
little attention,

8804
02:27:17,280 --> 02:27:18,180
avoiding Mrs.

8805
02:27:18,180 --> 02:27:18,540
Bennett

8806
02:27:18,540 --> 02:27:19,740
as much as possible,

8807
02:27:19,740 --> 02:27:20,160
saying

8808
02:27:20,160 --> 02:27:21,420
not much to Elizabeth

8809
02:27:21,620 --> 02:27:22,160
and nothing

8810
02:27:22,160 --> 02:27:23,360
at all to the others.

8811
02:27:23,760 --> 02:27:24,440
They were soon

8812
02:27:24,440 --> 02:27:25,820
gone again, rising

8813
02:27:25,820 --> 02:27:26,540
from their seats

8814
02:27:26,540 --> 02:27:27,360
with an activity

8815
02:27:27,360 --> 02:27:28,220
which took their brother

8816
02:27:28,220 --> 02:27:29,280
by surprise

8817
02:27:29,280 --> 02:27:30,240
and hurrying off

8818
02:27:30,240 --> 02:27:31,460
as if eager to escape

8819
02:27:31,460 --> 02:27:31,920
from Mrs.

8820
02:27:31,920 --> 02:27:33,120
Bennett's civilities.

8821
02:27:34,120 --> 02:27:35,000
The prospect of

8822
02:27:35,000 --> 02:27:35,900
the Netherfield Ball

8823
02:27:35,900 --> 02:27:37,200
was extremely agreeable

8824
02:27:37,200 --> 02:27:38,060
to every female

8825
02:27:38,060 --> 02:27:39,260
of the family.

8826
02:27:39,260 --> 02:27:39,660
Mrs.

8827
02:27:39,660 --> 02:27:40,280
Bennett chose

8828
02:27:40,280 --> 02:27:40,940
to consider it

8829
02:27:40,940 --> 02:27:42,080
as given in compliment

8830
02:27:42,080 --> 02:27:43,280
to her eldest daughter

8831
02:27:43,400 --> 02:27:43,680
and was

8832
02:27:43,680 --> 02:27:44,700
particularly flattered

8833
02:27:44,700 --> 02:27:45,260
by receiving

8834
02:27:45,260 --> 02:27:46,320
the invitation from Mr.

8835
02:27:46,320 --> 02:27:47,400
Bingley himself.

8836
02:27:47,400 --> 02:27:48,060
Instead of a

8837
02:27:48,060 --> 02:27:49,260
ceremonious card,

8838
02:27:49,700 --> 02:27:50,580
Jane pictured

8839
02:27:50,580 --> 02:27:51,120
to herself

8840
02:27:51,120 --> 02:27:51,920
a happy evening

8841
02:27:51,920 --> 02:27:52,580
in the society

8842
02:27:52,580 --> 02:27:53,720
of her two friends.

8843
02:27:53,720 --> 02:27:54,140
And the.

8844
02:27:54,140 --> 02:27:54,960
Attentions of

8845
02:27:54,960 --> 02:27:55,920
her brother.

8846
02:27:55,920 --> 02:27:57,120
And Elizabeth thought

8847
02:27:57,140 --> 02:27:58,200
pleasure of dancing

8848
02:27:58,200 --> 02:27:59,360
a great deal with Mr..

8849
02:27:59,360 --> 02:28:00,560
Wickham and of seeing.

8850
02:28:00,560 --> 02:28:01,320
A confirmation

8851
02:28:01,320 --> 02:28:02,340
of everything in Mr.

8852
02:28:02,340 --> 02:28:03,080
Darcy's look

8853
02:28:03,080 --> 02:28:04,280
and behavior.

8854
02:28:04,400 --> 02:28:05,060
The happiness

8855
02:28:05,060 --> 02:28:06,180
anticipated by Katherine

8856
02:28:06,180 --> 02:28:07,400
and Lydia depended

8857
02:28:07,400 --> 02:28:08,720
less on any single event

8858
02:28:08,720 --> 02:28:09,120
or on any

8859
02:28:09,120 --> 02:28:10,320
particular person.

8860
02:28:10,400 --> 02:28:10,640
Four.

8861
02:28:10,640 --> 02:28:10,980
Though

8862
02:28:10,980 --> 02:28:11,700
they each

8863
02:28:11,700 --> 02:28:12,720
like Elizabeth.

8864
02:28:12,720 --> 02:28:13,080
Meant.

8865
02:28:13,080 --> 02:28:13,560
To dance

8866
02:28:13,560 --> 02:28:14,220
half the evening

8867
02:28:14,220 --> 02:28:15,260
with Mr. Wickham.

8868
02:28:15,260 --> 02:28:16,460
He was by no means

8869
02:28:16,520 --> 02:28:17,160
only partner

8870
02:28:17,160 --> 02:28:18,360
who could satisfy them,

8871
02:28:18,500 --> 02:28:19,680
and a ball was,

8872
02:28:19,680 --> 02:28:21,020
at any rate, a ball.

8873
02:28:21,440 --> 02:28:22,320
And even Mary

8874
02:28:22,320 --> 02:28:23,280
could assure her family

8875
02:28:23,280 --> 02:28:23,600
that she

8876
02:28:23,600 --> 02:28:25,040
had no disinclination

8877
02:28:25,040 --> 02:28:26,240
for it.

8878
02:28:26,480 --> 02:28:27,420
While I can have

8879
02:28:27,420 --> 02:28:29,000
my mornings to myself,

8880
02:28:29,340 --> 02:28:30,380
said she,

8881
02:28:30,380 --> 02:28:31,460
it is enough.

8882
02:28:31,460 --> 02:28:32,100
I think it is

8883
02:28:32,100 --> 02:28:32,940
no sacrifice

8884
02:28:32,940 --> 02:28:33,840
to join occasionally

8885
02:28:33,840 --> 02:28:35,040
in evening engagements.

8886
02:28:35,400 --> 02:28:36,300
Society

8887
02:28:36,300 --> 02:28:37,500
claims on us all,

8888
02:28:37,760 --> 02:28:39,200
and I profess myself

8889
02:28:39,200 --> 02:28:39,860
one of those who

8890
02:28:39,860 --> 02:28:40,760
consider intervals

8891
02:28:40,760 --> 02:28:41,480
of recreation

8892
02:28:41,480 --> 02:28:42,140
and amusement

8893
02:28:42,140 --> 02:28:42,920
as desirable

8894
02:28:42,920 --> 02:28:44,120
for everybody.

8895
02:28:44,700 --> 02:28:45,900
Elizabeth Spirits

8896
02:28:45,900 --> 02:28:46,620
were so high on

8897
02:28:46,620 --> 02:28:47,520
this occasion.

8898
02:28:47,520 --> 02:28:47,900
That though

8899
02:28:47,900 --> 02:28:48,780
she did not often.

8900
02:28:48,780 --> 02:28:49,080
Speak

8901
02:28:49,080 --> 02:28:50,280
unnecessarily to Mr.

8902
02:28:50,280 --> 02:28:51,060
Collins.

8903
02:28:51,060 --> 02:28:51,840
She could not help.

8904
02:28:51,840 --> 02:28:52,440
Asking him

8905
02:28:52,440 --> 02:28:53,120
whether he intended

8906
02:28:53,120 --> 02:28:53,900
to accept Mr.

8907
02:28:53,900 --> 02:28:54,260
Bigley's.

8908
02:28:54,260 --> 02:28:55,220
Invitation

8909
02:28:55,220 --> 02:28:56,280
and if he did.

8910
02:28:56,280 --> 02:28:57,060
Whether he would think

8911
02:28:57,060 --> 02:28:58,020
it proper to join

8912
02:28:58,020 --> 02:28:58,200
in the.

8913
02:28:58,200 --> 02:28:59,400
Evening's amusement.

8914
02:28:59,540 --> 02:29:00,260
And she was rather

8915
02:29:00,260 --> 02:29:01,140
surprised to find

8916
02:29:01,140 --> 02:29:01,820
that he entertained

8917
02:29:01,820 --> 02:29:02,880
no scruple whatsoever

8918
02:29:02,880 --> 02:29:03,780
on that head

8919
02:29:03,780 --> 02:29:04,580
and was very far

8920
02:29:04,580 --> 02:29:05,720
from dreading a rebuke,

8921
02:29:05,720 --> 02:29:06,080
either

8922
02:29:06,080 --> 02:29:07,160
from the archbishop

8923
02:29:07,160 --> 02:29:07,700
or Lady

8924
02:29:07,700 --> 02:29:08,700
Catherine de Berg

8925
02:29:08,700 --> 02:29:10,020
by venturing to dance.

8926
02:29:11,280 --> 02:29:12,180
I am by no means of

8927
02:29:12,180 --> 02:29:13,400
opinion, I assure you.

8928
02:29:13,760 --> 02:29:14,960
Said he.

8929
02:29:15,360 --> 02:29:16,140
That a ball of this

8930
02:29:16,140 --> 02:29:16,760
kind given

8931
02:29:16,760 --> 02:29:17,360
by a young man

8932
02:29:17,360 --> 02:29:17,960
of character

8933
02:29:17,960 --> 02:29:19,160
to respectable people

8934
02:29:20,660 --> 02:29:21,660
can have any evil

8935
02:29:21,660 --> 02:29:22,860
tendency.

8936
02:29:24,840 --> 02:29:25,620
And I am so far

8937
02:29:25,620 --> 02:29:26,180
from objecting

8938
02:29:26,180 --> 02:29:27,180
to dancing myself

8939
02:29:27,180 --> 02:29:27,780
that I shall hope

8940
02:29:27,780 --> 02:29:28,980
to be honored

8941
02:29:29,160 --> 02:29:29,840
with the hands

8942
02:29:29,840 --> 02:29:31,200
of all my fair cousins

8943
02:29:31,200 --> 02:29:31,800
in the course

8944
02:29:31,800 --> 02:29:33,000
of the evening.

8945
02:29:33,200 --> 02:29:33,740
And I take

8946
02:29:33,740 --> 02:29:34,580
this opportunity

8947
02:29:34,580 --> 02:29:35,280
of soliciting

8948
02:29:35,280 --> 02:29:36,480
yours, Miss Elizabeth,

8949
02:29:37,220 --> 02:29:37,680
for the two

8950
02:29:37,680 --> 02:29:39,080
first dances, especially

8951
02:29:40,680 --> 02:29:41,300
a preference

8952
02:29:41,300 --> 02:29:42,380
which I trust my cousin

8953
02:29:42,380 --> 02:29:42,900
Jane.

8954
02:29:42,900 --> 02:29:43,520
When a tribute

8955
02:29:43,520 --> 02:29:44,720
to the right cause

8956
02:29:45,260 --> 02:29:45,840
and not to

8957
02:29:45,840 --> 02:29:47,040
any disrespect for her.

8958
02:29:48,300 --> 02:29:49,560
Elizabeth felt herself

8959
02:29:49,560 --> 02:29:51,020
completely taken in.

8960
02:29:51,420 --> 02:29:52,560
She had fully proposed

8961
02:29:52,560 --> 02:29:53,580
being engaged by Mr.

8962
02:29:53,580 --> 02:29:53,940
Wickham

8963
02:29:53,940 --> 02:29:55,140
for those very dances

8964
02:29:55,400 --> 02:29:56,160
and to have Mr.

8965
02:29:56,160 --> 02:29:57,440
Collins instead.

8966
02:29:57,920 --> 02:29:58,800
Her liveliness

8967
02:29:58,800 --> 02:29:59,460
had never been

8968
02:29:59,460 --> 02:30:00,660
worse timed.

8969
02:30:00,780 --> 02:30:01,520
There was no help

8970
02:30:01,520 --> 02:30:01,860
for it.

8971
02:30:01,860 --> 02:30:02,900
However, Mr.

8972
02:30:02,900 --> 02:30:03,840
Wickham's happiness

8973
02:30:03,840 --> 02:30:04,380
and her own

8974
02:30:04,380 --> 02:30:04,940
were perforce

8975
02:30:04,940 --> 02:30:06,140
delayed a little longer,

8976
02:30:06,260 --> 02:30:06,720
and Mr.

8977
02:30:06,720 --> 02:30:07,100
Collins

8978
02:30:07,100 --> 02:30:08,040
proposal accepted

8979
02:30:08,040 --> 02:30:08,520
with as good

8980
02:30:08,520 --> 02:30:09,720
a grace as she could.

8981
02:30:09,960 --> 02:30:10,520
She was not.

8982
02:30:10,520 --> 02:30:11,300
The better pleased

8983
02:30:11,300 --> 02:30:12,060
with his gallantry

8984
02:30:12,060 --> 02:30:12,800
from the idea.

8985
02:30:12,800 --> 02:30:13,440
Suggested of

8986
02:30:13,440 --> 02:30:14,640
something more.

8987
02:30:14,720 --> 02:30:16,320
It now first struck her.

8988
02:30:16,620 --> 02:30:16,940
That.

8989
02:30:16,940 --> 02:30:18,140
She was selected

8990
02:30:18,140 --> 02:30:19,100
from among her sisters

8991
02:30:19,100 --> 02:30:19,700
as worthy

8992
02:30:19,700 --> 02:30:20,660
of being mistress

8993
02:30:20,660 --> 02:30:21,860
of Hansford Parsonage

8994
02:30:22,020 --> 02:30:23,100
and of assisting to form

8995
02:30:23,100 --> 02:30:24,060
a quadrille table

8996
02:30:24,060 --> 02:30:24,480
at Rose

8997
02:30:24,480 --> 02:30:25,800
Ings in the absence

8998
02:30:25,800 --> 02:30:26,580
of more eligible

8999
02:30:26,580 --> 02:30:27,720
visitors.

9000
02:30:27,720 --> 02:30:28,820
The idea soon.

9001
02:30:28,820 --> 02:30:30,020
Reached a conviction.

9002
02:30:30,140 --> 02:30:30,420
As.

9003
02:30:30,420 --> 02:30:31,100
She observed

9004
02:30:31,100 --> 02:30:31,760
as increasing

9005
02:30:31,760 --> 02:30:33,080
civilities herself

9006
02:30:33,360 --> 02:30:33,800
and her

9007
02:30:33,800 --> 02:30:34,760
his frequent attempt

9008
02:30:34,760 --> 02:30:35,480
at a compliment

9009
02:30:35,480 --> 02:30:36,860
on her wit and vivacity.

9010
02:30:37,320 --> 02:30:37,700
And though

9011
02:30:37,700 --> 02:30:38,640
more astonished

9012
02:30:38,640 --> 02:30:39,960
than gratified herself

9013
02:30:39,960 --> 02:30:40,260
by the

9014
02:30:40,260 --> 02:30:41,460
effect of her charms,

9015
02:30:41,520 --> 02:30:42,420
it was not long

9016
02:30:42,420 --> 02:30:42,800
before her

9017
02:30:42,800 --> 02:30:43,380
mother gave her

9018
02:30:43,380 --> 02:30:44,160
to understand that

9019
02:30:44,160 --> 02:30:44,820
the probability

9020
02:30:44,820 --> 02:30:45,480
of their marriage

9021
02:30:45,480 --> 02:30:46,640
was extremely agreeable

9022
02:30:46,640 --> 02:30:47,840
to her.

9023
02:30:47,840 --> 02:30:48,740
Elizabeth, however,

9024
02:30:48,740 --> 02:30:49,460
did not choose

9025
02:30:49,460 --> 02:30:50,420
to take the hint.

9026
02:30:50,420 --> 02:30:51,300
Being well aware

9027
02:30:51,300 --> 02:30:52,440
that a serious dispute

9028
02:30:52,440 --> 02:30:53,420
must be the consequence

9029
02:30:53,420 --> 02:30:54,620
of any reply.

9030
02:30:54,860 --> 02:30:55,200
Mr.

9031
02:30:55,200 --> 02:30:55,800
Collins might

9032
02:30:55,800 --> 02:30:57,000
never make the offer.

9033
02:30:57,020 --> 02:30:58,200
And still he did.

9034
02:30:58,200 --> 02:30:59,040
It was useless.

9035
02:30:59,040 --> 02:31:00,240
To quarrel about him

9036
02:31:00,980 --> 02:31:01,820
if there had not

9037
02:31:01,820 --> 02:31:02,580
another field ball

9038
02:31:02,580 --> 02:31:03,300
to prepare for

9039
02:31:03,300 --> 02:31:04,740
and talk of the younger

9040
02:31:04,740 --> 02:31:05,300
Miss Bennetts

9041
02:31:05,300 --> 02:31:05,660
would have been

9042
02:31:05,660 --> 02:31:06,800
in a very pitiable state

9043
02:31:06,800 --> 02:31:07,980
at this time. Four.

9044
02:31:07,980 --> 02:31:08,280
From the.

9045
02:31:08,280 --> 02:31:09,380
Day of the invitation.

9046
02:31:09,380 --> 02:31:10,580
To the day of the ball,

9047
02:31:10,620 --> 02:31:11,240
there was such

9048
02:31:11,240 --> 02:31:11,960
a succession

9049
02:31:11,960 --> 02:31:12,900
rain as prevented

9050
02:31:12,900 --> 02:31:13,820
their walking to merit.

9051
02:31:13,820 --> 02:31:14,820
And once

9052
02:31:14,820 --> 02:31:16,580
no aunt, no officers.

9053
02:31:16,800 --> 02:31:17,820
No news could.

9054
02:31:17,820 --> 02:31:18,860
Be sought after.

9055
02:31:18,860 --> 02:31:20,180
The very shoe roses

9056
02:31:20,180 --> 02:31:21,380
for Netherfield were by.

9057
02:31:22,500 --> 02:31:23,280
Even Elizabeth

9058
02:31:23,280 --> 02:31:23,820
might have found

9059
02:31:23,820 --> 02:31:24,360
some trial

9060
02:31:24,360 --> 02:31:25,040
of her patience

9061
02:31:25,040 --> 02:31:25,460
and weather,

9062
02:31:25,460 --> 02:31:26,600
which totally suspended

9063
02:31:26,600 --> 02:31:27,180
the improvement

9064
02:31:27,180 --> 02:31:27,780
of her acquaintance

9065
02:31:27,780 --> 02:31:28,860
with Mr. Wickham.

9066
02:31:28,860 --> 02:31:29,360
Has nothing.

9067
02:31:29,360 --> 02:31:29,840
Less than a

9068
02:31:29,840 --> 02:31:31,040
dance On Tuesday.

9069
02:31:31,220 --> 02:31:32,180
Could have made such

9070
02:31:32,180 --> 02:31:33,420
a Friday, Saturday,

9071
02:31:33,420 --> 02:31:34,620
Sunday and Monday

9072
02:31:34,820 --> 02:31:36,240
endurable to Kitty

9073
02:31:36,240 --> 02:31:37,440
and Lydia.

9074
02:31:38,220 --> 02:31:39,420
Chapter 18

9075
02:31:41,040 --> 02:31:42,260
Till Elizabeth entered

9076
02:31:42,260 --> 02:31:42,860
the drawing room

9077
02:31:42,860 --> 02:31:43,760
at Netherfield

9078
02:31:43,760 --> 02:31:44,820
and looked in vain

9079
02:31:44,820 --> 02:31:45,560
for Mr. Wickham.

9080
02:31:45,560 --> 02:31:46,260
Among the cluster

9081
02:31:46,260 --> 02:31:47,000
of red coats

9082
02:31:47,000 --> 02:31:48,080
there assembled.

9083
02:31:48,080 --> 02:31:48,980
A doubt of his.

9084
02:31:48,980 --> 02:31:49,800
Being present,

9085
02:31:49,800 --> 02:31:51,060
had never to her

9086
02:31:51,500 --> 02:31:52,280
the certainty of

9087
02:31:52,280 --> 02:31:52,740
meeting him

9088
02:31:52,740 --> 02:31:53,660
and not being shocked

9089
02:31:53,660 --> 02:31:54,180
by any of

9090
02:31:54,180 --> 02:31:55,020
those recollections

9091
02:31:55,020 --> 02:31:55,380
that might

9092
02:31:55,380 --> 02:31:56,400
not unreasonably

9093
02:31:56,400 --> 02:31:57,600
have alarmed her.

9094
02:31:57,620 --> 02:31:58,520
She had dressed with

9095
02:31:58,520 --> 02:31:59,720
more than usual care

9096
02:31:59,880 --> 02:32:00,600
and, prepared

9097
02:32:00,600 --> 02:32:01,740
in the highest spirits

9098
02:32:01,740 --> 02:32:02,540
for the conquest

9099
02:32:02,540 --> 02:32:03,500
of all that remained

9100
02:32:03,500 --> 02:32:04,220
on, subdued

9101
02:32:04,220 --> 02:32:05,180
of his heart,

9102
02:32:05,180 --> 02:32:06,380
trusting that it was not

9103
02:32:06,380 --> 02:32:07,440
more than might be won

9104
02:32:07,440 --> 02:32:07,920
in the course

9105
02:32:07,920 --> 02:32:09,120
of the evening.

9106
02:32:09,200 --> 02:32:11,100
But in an instant rose

9107
02:32:11,100 --> 02:32:12,300
the dreadful suspicion

9108
02:32:12,480 --> 02:32:12,960
of his.

9109
02:32:12,960 --> 02:32:13,760
Being purposely

9110
02:32:13,760 --> 02:32:14,660
omitted for Mr.

9111
02:32:14,660 --> 02:32:15,660
Darcy's pleasure

9112
02:32:15,660 --> 02:32:16,260
in the binky's

9113
02:32:16,260 --> 02:32:16,760
invitation

9114
02:32:16,760 --> 02:32:17,960
to the officers.

9115
02:32:18,020 --> 02:32:18,600
And though this was.

9116
02:32:18,600 --> 02:32:19,800
Not exactly the case,

9117
02:32:19,980 --> 02:32:20,720
the absolute

9118
02:32:20,720 --> 02:32:21,840
fact of his absence

9119
02:32:21,840 --> 02:32:22,460
was pronounced

9120
02:32:22,460 --> 02:32:23,660
by his friend Danny,

9121
02:32:23,840 --> 02:32:24,240
to whom

9122
02:32:24,240 --> 02:32:25,520
Lydia eagerly applied,

9123
02:32:25,760 --> 02:32:26,660
and who told them

9124
02:32:26,660 --> 02:32:27,180
that Wickham

9125
02:32:27,180 --> 02:32:27,800
had been obliged

9126
02:32:27,800 --> 02:32:28,460
to go to town

9127
02:32:28,460 --> 02:32:28,940
on business

9128
02:32:28,940 --> 02:32:29,840
the day before

9129
02:32:29,840 --> 02:32:30,420
and was not

9130
02:32:30,420 --> 02:32:31,620
yet returned,

9131
02:32:31,620 --> 02:32:32,420
adding with a

9132
02:32:32,420 --> 02:32:33,620
significant smile.

9133
02:32:34,280 --> 02:32:35,160
I do not imagine

9134
02:32:35,160 --> 02:32:35,700
his business

9135
02:32:35,700 --> 02:32:35,900
would have

9136
02:32:35,900 --> 02:32:37,100
called him away just now

9137
02:32:37,440 --> 02:32:38,120
if he had not wish

9138
02:32:38,120 --> 02:32:38,780
to avoid a

9139
02:32:38,780 --> 02:32:39,980
certain gentleman here.

9140
02:32:41,220 --> 02:32:41,900
This part of

9141
02:32:41,900 --> 02:32:42,860
his intelligence,

9142
02:32:42,860 --> 02:32:43,820
although unheard

9143
02:32:43,820 --> 02:32:44,600
by Lydia,

9144
02:32:44,600 --> 02:32:45,840
was caught by Elizabeth,

9145
02:32:46,200 --> 02:32:47,220
and as it assured her

9146
02:32:47,220 --> 02:32:48,440
that Darcy was not less

9147
02:32:48,440 --> 02:32:48,980
answerable

9148
02:32:48,980 --> 02:32:50,000
for Wickham's absence

9149
02:32:50,000 --> 02:32:50,400
than if her

9150
02:32:50,400 --> 02:32:51,140
first surmise

9151
02:32:51,140 --> 02:32:52,260
had been, just.

9152
02:32:52,260 --> 02:32:52,680
Every.

9153
02:32:52,680 --> 02:32:53,720
Feeling of displeasure

9154
02:32:53,720 --> 02:32:54,540
against the former

9155
02:32:54,540 --> 02:32:55,560
was so sharpened

9156
02:32:55,560 --> 02:32:56,040
by immediate

9157
02:32:56,040 --> 02:32:56,880
disappointment

9158
02:32:56,880 --> 02:32:57,360
that she could

9159
02:32:57,360 --> 02:32:58,200
hardly reply,

9160
02:32:58,200 --> 02:32:59,460
with tolerable civility

9161
02:32:59,460 --> 02:33:00,660
to the polite inquiries

9162
02:33:00,660 --> 02:33:00,920
which he

9163
02:33:00,920 --> 02:33:01,920
directly afterwards

9164
02:33:01,920 --> 02:33:03,120
approached to make

9165
02:33:03,300 --> 02:33:04,080
attendance.

9166
02:33:04,080 --> 02:33:05,000
Forbearance.

9167
02:33:05,000 --> 02:33:06,320
Patience with Darcy.

9168
02:33:06,420 --> 02:33:06,680
Was.

9169
02:33:06,680 --> 02:33:07,880
Injury to Wickham.

9170
02:33:08,240 --> 02:33:08,600
She was.

9171
02:33:08,600 --> 02:33:09,720
Resolved against any.

9172
02:33:09,720 --> 02:33:10,640
Sort of conversation

9173
02:33:10,640 --> 02:33:11,820
with him and turned.

9174
02:33:11,820 --> 02:33:12,440
Away with a degree

9175
02:33:12,440 --> 02:33:13,140
of ill humor,

9176
02:33:13,140 --> 02:33:13,820
which she could not

9177
02:33:13,820 --> 02:33:14,700
wholly surmount.

9178
02:33:14,700 --> 02:33:15,800
Even in speaking to Mr.

9179
02:33:15,800 --> 02:33:16,520
Bingley,

9180
02:33:16,520 --> 02:33:17,960
whose blind partiality

9181
02:33:18,060 --> 02:33:19,260
provoked her.

9182
02:33:19,760 --> 02:33:20,400
But Elizabeth

9183
02:33:20,400 --> 02:33:21,200
was not formed

9184
02:33:21,200 --> 02:33:22,260
for ill humor,

9185
02:33:22,260 --> 02:33:22,680
and though

9186
02:33:22,680 --> 02:33:23,480
every prospect

9187
02:33:23,480 --> 02:33:23,940
of her own

9188
02:33:23,940 --> 02:33:24,540
was destroyed

9189
02:33:24,540 --> 02:33:25,440
for the evening.

9190
02:33:25,440 --> 02:33:26,280
It could not long.

9191
02:33:26,280 --> 02:33:27,480
Dwell on her spirits.

9192
02:33:27,740 --> 02:33:28,320
And having.

9193
02:33:28,320 --> 02:33:29,280
Told all her griefs

9194
02:33:29,280 --> 02:33:29,720
to Charlotte.

9195
02:33:29,720 --> 02:33:30,980
Lucas, whom she had not.

9196
02:33:30,980 --> 02:33:32,060
Seen for a week,

9197
02:33:32,060 --> 02:33:32,900
she was soon able

9198
02:33:32,900 --> 02:33:33,180
to make

9199
02:33:33,180 --> 02:33:34,340
a voluntary transition

9200
02:33:34,340 --> 02:33:35,060
to the oddities

9201
02:33:35,060 --> 02:33:35,880
of her cousin

9202
02:33:35,880 --> 02:33:36,780
and to point him out

9203
02:33:36,780 --> 02:33:36,960
to her

9204
02:33:36,960 --> 02:33:38,160
particular notice.

9205
02:33:38,400 --> 02:33:39,680
The first two dances,

9206
02:33:39,680 --> 02:33:40,320
however,

9207
02:33:40,320 --> 02:33:40,680
brought a

9208
02:33:40,680 --> 02:33:41,880
return of distress.

9209
02:33:42,080 --> 02:33:43,200
They were dances of

9210
02:33:43,200 --> 02:33:44,900
mortification, Mr.

9211
02:33:44,900 --> 02:33:45,480
Collins,

9212
02:33:45,480 --> 02:33:46,680
awkward and solemn,

9213
02:33:46,800 --> 02:33:47,720
apologizing

9214
02:33:47,720 --> 02:33:48,800
instead of attending

9215
02:33:48,800 --> 02:33:49,920
and often moving wrong

9216
02:33:49,920 --> 02:33:50,460
without being

9217
02:33:50,460 --> 02:33:51,360
aware of it,

9218
02:33:51,360 --> 02:33:52,560
gave her all the shame

9219
02:33:52,560 --> 02:33:53,100
and misery

9220
02:33:53,100 --> 02:33:53,300
which a

9221
02:33:53,300 --> 02:33:54,300
disagreeable partner

9222
02:33:54,300 --> 02:33:55,400
for a couple of dances

9223
02:33:55,400 --> 02:33:56,360
can give.

9224
02:33:56,360 --> 02:33:57,020
The moment of.

9225
02:33:57,020 --> 02:33:57,680
Her release from

9226
02:33:57,680 --> 02:33:59,100
him was Ecstasy.

9227
02:34:00,120 --> 02:34:01,320
She danced next with an.

9228
02:34:01,320 --> 02:34:01,980
Officer

9229
02:34:01,980 --> 02:34:03,060
and had the refreshment

9230
02:34:03,060 --> 02:34:04,200
of talking of Wickham.

9231
02:34:04,200 --> 02:34:04,400
And.

9232
02:34:04,400 --> 02:34:04,800
Of hearing

9233
02:34:04,800 --> 02:34:05,120
that he was

9234
02:34:05,120 --> 02:34:06,320
universally liked.

9235
02:34:06,540 --> 02:34:07,400
When those dances

9236
02:34:07,400 --> 02:34:08,060
were over,

9237
02:34:08,060 --> 02:34:08,640
she returned

9238
02:34:08,640 --> 02:34:09,800
to Charlotte Lucas

9239
02:34:09,800 --> 02:34:10,980
and was in conversation

9240
02:34:10,980 --> 02:34:11,720
with her

9241
02:34:11,720 --> 02:34:12,620
when she found herself

9242
02:34:12,620 --> 02:34:13,380
suddenly addressed

9243
02:34:13,380 --> 02:34:13,760
by Mr.

9244
02:34:13,760 --> 02:34:14,520
Darcy,

9245
02:34:14,520 --> 02:34:14,940
who took her

9246
02:34:14,940 --> 02:34:16,100
so much by surprise

9247
02:34:16,100 --> 02:34:16,320
and his

9248
02:34:16,320 --> 02:34:17,520
application for her

9249
02:34:18,000 --> 02:34:18,780
that without knowing.

9250
02:34:18,780 --> 02:34:19,860
What she did, she.

9251
02:34:19,860 --> 02:34:21,060
Accepted him.

9252
02:34:21,140 --> 02:34:22,200
He walked away again

9253
02:34:22,200 --> 02:34:23,000
immediately

9254
02:34:23,000 --> 02:34:23,760
and she was left

9255
02:34:23,760 --> 02:34:24,900
to fret over her own

9256
02:34:24,900 --> 02:34:25,280
want of

9257
02:34:25,280 --> 02:34:26,480
presence of mind.

9258
02:34:26,600 --> 02:34:27,180
Charlotte

9259
02:34:27,180 --> 02:34:28,380
Tried to console her.

9260
02:34:29,160 --> 02:34:30,420
I daresay will find him

9261
02:34:30,420 --> 02:34:31,620
very agreeable.

9262
02:34:31,920 --> 02:34:33,120
Heaven forbid.

9263
02:34:33,420 --> 02:34:33,900
That would be

9264
02:34:33,900 --> 02:34:34,880
the greatest misfortune

9265
02:34:34,880 --> 02:34:35,600
of all.

9266
02:34:35,600 --> 02:34:37,020
To find a man agreeable

9267
02:34:37,200 --> 02:34:37,500
one is

9268
02:34:37,500 --> 02:34:38,700
determined to hate.

9269
02:34:38,840 --> 02:34:39,720
Do not wish me

9270
02:34:39,720 --> 02:34:40,920
such an evil.

9271
02:34:41,280 --> 02:34:42,060
When the dancing.

9272
02:34:42,060 --> 02:34:42,660
Recommenced,

9273
02:34:42,660 --> 02:34:43,760
however, and Darcy

9274
02:34:43,760 --> 02:34:44,600
approached to claim

9275
02:34:44,600 --> 02:34:45,420
her hand.

9276
02:34:45,420 --> 02:34:46,040
Charlotte could

9277
02:34:46,040 --> 02:34:46,460
not help.

9278
02:34:46,460 --> 02:34:47,280
Cautioning her

9279
02:34:47,280 --> 02:34:48,120
in a whisper

9280
02:34:48,120 --> 02:34:49,460
not to be a simpleton

9281
02:34:49,680 --> 02:34:50,840
and allow her fancy

9282
02:34:50,840 --> 02:34:51,360
for Wickham

9283
02:34:51,360 --> 02:34:52,100
to make her appear

9284
02:34:52,100 --> 02:34:53,300
unpleasant in the eyes

9285
02:34:53,300 --> 02:34:54,660
of a man of ten times

9286
02:34:54,660 --> 02:34:55,860
his consequence.

9287
02:34:56,120 --> 02:34:57,440
Elizabeth made answer

9288
02:34:57,600 --> 02:34:58,140
and took her

9289
02:34:58,140 --> 02:34:59,340
place in the set.

9290
02:34:59,340 --> 02:35:00,600
Amazed at the dignity

9291
02:35:00,600 --> 02:35:00,920
to which.

9292
02:35:00,920 --> 02:35:01,700
She was arrived

9293
02:35:01,700 --> 02:35:02,360
and being allowed

9294
02:35:02,360 --> 02:35:03,680
to stand opposite to Mr.

9295
02:35:03,680 --> 02:35:05,040
Darcy and reading it,

9296
02:35:05,040 --> 02:35:05,540
her neighbors

9297
02:35:05,540 --> 02:35:07,260
looks their amazement

9298
02:35:07,260 --> 02:35:08,460
and beholding it.

9299
02:35:08,540 --> 02:35:09,740
They stood for some time

9300
02:35:09,740 --> 02:35:10,940
without speaking a word,

9301
02:35:11,040 --> 02:35:12,180
and she began to imagine

9302
02:35:12,180 --> 02:35:13,040
that their silence

9303
02:35:13,040 --> 02:35:13,740
was to last

9304
02:35:13,740 --> 02:35:14,940
in the two dances.

9305
02:35:15,060 --> 02:35:15,600
And at first

9306
02:35:15,600 --> 02:35:16,220
she was resolved

9307
02:35:16,220 --> 02:35:17,420
not to break it

9308
02:35:17,460 --> 02:35:18,860
till suddenly fancying

9309
02:35:18,860 --> 02:35:19,280
that it would be

9310
02:35:19,280 --> 02:35:20,160
the greater punishment

9311
02:35:20,160 --> 02:35:20,720
to her partner

9312
02:35:20,720 --> 02:35:21,920
to oblige him to talk.

9313
02:35:22,160 --> 02:35:22,640
She made

9314
02:35:22,640 --> 02:35:24,000
some slight observation

9315
02:35:24,000 --> 02:35:25,200
on the dance.

9316
02:35:25,200 --> 02:35:26,180
He replied

9317
02:35:26,180 --> 02:35:26,940
and was again.

9318
02:35:26,940 --> 02:35:28,040
Silent

9319
02:35:28,040 --> 02:35:28,940
after a pause

9320
02:35:28,940 --> 02:35:29,880
of some minutes.

9321
02:35:29,880 --> 02:35:30,560
She addressed him

9322
02:35:30,560 --> 02:35:31,760
a second time with.

9323
02:35:32,340 --> 02:35:33,200
It is your turn

9324
02:35:33,200 --> 02:35:34,020
to say something now.

9325
02:35:34,020 --> 02:35:35,100
Mr. Darcy.

9326
02:35:35,100 --> 02:35:35,780
I talked

9327
02:35:35,780 --> 02:35:36,680
about the dance,

9328
02:35:36,680 --> 02:35:37,980
and you ought to make

9329
02:35:37,980 --> 02:35:38,940
some sort of remark

9330
02:35:38,940 --> 02:35:39,980
on the size of the room

9331
02:35:39,980 --> 02:35:40,560
or the number

9332
02:35:40,560 --> 02:35:41,760
of couples.

9333
02:35:41,940 --> 02:35:42,840
He smiled

9334
02:35:42,840 --> 02:35:43,620
and assured her

9335
02:35:43,620 --> 02:35:44,160
that whatever

9336
02:35:44,160 --> 02:35:45,240
she wished him to say

9337
02:35:45,240 --> 02:35:45,560
should be.

9338
02:35:45,560 --> 02:35:47,540
Said very well.

9339
02:35:47,840 --> 02:35:48,740
That reply will.

9340
02:35:48,740 --> 02:35:49,940
Do for the present.

9341
02:35:49,940 --> 02:35:51,120
Perhaps by and by

9342
02:35:51,120 --> 02:35:51,980
I may observe.

9343
02:35:51,980 --> 02:35:53,000
That private balls.

9344
02:35:53,000 --> 02:35:53,700
Are much pleasanter

9345
02:35:53,700 --> 02:35:54,900
than public ones.

9346
02:35:55,100 --> 02:35:56,060
But now we may

9347
02:35:56,060 --> 02:35:57,260
be silent.

9348
02:35:57,540 --> 02:35:58,040
Do you talk

9349
02:35:58,040 --> 02:35:58,740
by rule then,

9350
02:35:58,740 --> 02:35:59,940
while you are dancing?

9351
02:36:00,260 --> 02:36:01,340
Sometimes

9352
02:36:01,340 --> 02:36:02,480
one must speak

9353
02:36:02,480 --> 02:36:03,680
a little, you know.

9354
02:36:03,780 --> 02:36:04,640
It would look odd

9355
02:36:04,640 --> 02:36:05,820
to be entirely silent

9356
02:36:05,820 --> 02:36:06,480
for half an hour

9357
02:36:06,480 --> 02:36:07,380
together.

9358
02:36:07,380 --> 02:36:07,860
And yet,

9359
02:36:07,860 --> 02:36:08,480
for the advantages

9360
02:36:08,480 --> 02:36:09,840
of some conversation

9361
02:36:09,840 --> 02:36:10,860
ought to be so arranged.

9362
02:36:10,860 --> 02:36:11,660
As they might have

9363
02:36:11,660 --> 02:36:12,140
the trouble of.

9364
02:36:12,140 --> 02:36:12,380
Saying

9365
02:36:12,380 --> 02:36:13,580
as little as possible.

9366
02:36:13,620 --> 02:36:14,780
Are you consulting

9367
02:36:14,780 --> 02:36:15,360
own feelings

9368
02:36:15,360 --> 02:36:16,500
in the present case,

9369
02:36:16,500 --> 02:36:17,400
or do you imagine

9370
02:36:17,400 --> 02:36:17,840
that you are

9371
02:36:17,840 --> 02:36:19,040
gratifying mine?

9372
02:36:19,580 --> 02:36:20,520
Both.

9373
02:36:20,520 --> 02:36:21,020
Replied

9374
02:36:21,020 --> 02:36:22,220
Elizabeth archly.

9375
02:36:22,680 --> 02:36:23,720
For I have always seen

9376
02:36:23,720 --> 02:36:24,800
a great similarity

9377
02:36:24,800 --> 02:36:26,000
the town of our minds.

9378
02:36:26,280 --> 02:36:26,880
We are each of

9379
02:36:26,880 --> 02:36:28,260
an unsocial, taciturn

9380
02:36:28,260 --> 02:36:29,180
disposition,

9381
02:36:29,180 --> 02:36:30,320
unwilling to speak

9382
02:36:30,320 --> 02:36:30,780
unless.

9383
02:36:30,780 --> 02:36:31,400
We expect

9384
02:36:31,400 --> 02:36:32,160
to say something

9385
02:36:32,160 --> 02:36:32,780
upon the Mays.

9386
02:36:32,780 --> 02:36:33,900
The whole room,

9387
02:36:33,900 --> 02:36:34,860
and be handed

9388
02:36:34,860 --> 02:36:35,540
to posterity.

9389
02:36:35,540 --> 02:36:36,560
With all the eclat

9390
02:36:36,560 --> 02:36:37,760
of a proverb.

9391
02:36:37,920 --> 02:36:39,080
This is no very striking

9392
02:36:39,080 --> 02:36:39,660
resemblance

9393
02:36:39,660 --> 02:36:40,560
of your own character.

9394
02:36:40,560 --> 02:36:41,660
I am sure.

9395
02:36:41,660 --> 02:36:42,720
Said he.

9396
02:36:42,720 --> 02:36:43,500
How near it may be

9397
02:36:43,500 --> 02:36:43,940
to mine.

9398
02:36:43,940 --> 02:36:45,140
I cannot to say.

9399
02:36:45,260 --> 02:36:45,920
You think

9400
02:36:45,920 --> 02:36:46,520
it's a faithful

9401
02:36:46,520 --> 02:36:47,660
portrait? Undoubtedly.

9402
02:36:48,900 --> 02:36:49,400
I must

9403
02:36:49,400 --> 02:36:50,300
not decide on my

9404
02:36:50,300 --> 02:36:51,500
own performance.

9405
02:36:51,900 --> 02:36:53,100
He made no answer.

9406
02:36:53,180 --> 02:36:54,060
And they were again

9407
02:36:54,060 --> 02:36:54,600
silent,

9408
02:36:54,600 --> 02:36:55,320
until they had gone

9409
02:36:55,320 --> 02:36:56,120
down the dance.

9410
02:36:56,120 --> 02:36:56,960
When he asked her

9411
02:36:56,960 --> 02:36:57,920
if she and her sisters

9412
02:36:57,920 --> 02:36:59,220
did not very often walk

9413
02:36:59,220 --> 02:37:00,420
to Maritain,

9414
02:37:00,440 --> 02:37:01,200
she answered in

9415
02:37:01,200 --> 02:37:02,180
the affirmative

9416
02:37:02,180 --> 02:37:02,960
and unable

9417
02:37:02,960 --> 02:37:03,500
to resist the.

9418
02:37:03,500 --> 02:37:04,700
Temptation, added

9419
02:37:05,220 --> 02:37:06,020
When you met us there

9420
02:37:06,020 --> 02:37:07,280
the other day, we had

9421
02:37:07,280 --> 02:37:08,180
just been forming

9422
02:37:08,180 --> 02:37:09,380
a new acquaintance.

9423
02:37:09,900 --> 02:37:10,500
The effect

9424
02:37:10,500 --> 02:37:11,480
was immediate.

9425
02:37:11,480 --> 02:37:12,420
A deeper shade

9426
02:37:12,420 --> 02:37:13,200
of hauteur

9427
02:37:13,200 --> 02:37:14,400
over Sparta's features.

9428
02:37:14,580 --> 02:37:15,840
But he said not a word.

9429
02:37:16,140 --> 02:37:17,060
And Elizabeth,

9430
02:37:17,060 --> 02:37:18,180
though blaming herself

9431
02:37:18,180 --> 02:37:19,260
for her own weakness,

9432
02:37:19,260 --> 02:37:20,460
could not go on.

9433
02:37:20,840 --> 02:37:22,220
At length, Dorothy spoke

9434
02:37:22,440 --> 02:37:22,820
and in a

9435
02:37:22,820 --> 02:37:23,720
constrained manner,

9436
02:37:23,720 --> 02:37:24,920
said.

9437
02:37:25,100 --> 02:37:25,460
Mr.

9438
02:37:25,460 --> 02:37:26,300
Wickham is blessed

9439
02:37:26,300 --> 02:37:27,500
with such happy manners

9440
02:37:27,680 --> 02:37:28,400
as may ensure

9441
02:37:28,400 --> 02:37:29,600
his making friends.

9442
02:37:30,140 --> 02:37:30,860
Whether he may be

9443
02:37:30,860 --> 02:37:31,700
equally capable

9444
02:37:31,700 --> 02:37:32,600
of retaining them

9445
02:37:32,600 --> 02:37:33,540
is less certain.

9446
02:37:34,740 --> 02:37:35,600
He has been so

9447
02:37:35,600 --> 02:37:36,480
unlucky as to lose

9448
02:37:36,480 --> 02:37:37,680
your friendship.

9449
02:37:38,000 --> 02:37:38,880
Replied Elizabeth,

9450
02:37:38,880 --> 02:37:39,980
with emphasis.

9451
02:37:39,980 --> 02:37:40,860
And in a manner

9452
02:37:40,860 --> 02:37:41,180
which he is

9453
02:37:41,180 --> 02:37:41,900
likely to suffer

9454
02:37:41,900 --> 02:37:43,100
from all his life.

9455
02:37:43,700 --> 02:37:44,900
Darcy made no answer

9456
02:37:45,140 --> 02:37:46,260
and seemed desirous

9457
02:37:46,260 --> 02:37:47,460
of changing the subject.

9458
02:37:47,960 --> 02:37:48,840
At that moment,

9459
02:37:48,840 --> 02:37:49,320
Sir William

9460
02:37:49,320 --> 02:37:49,980
Lucas appeared

9461
02:37:49,980 --> 02:37:51,260
close to them, meaning

9462
02:37:51,260 --> 02:37:52,340
to pass through the set

9463
02:37:52,340 --> 02:37:52,760
to the other

9464
02:37:52,760 --> 02:37:53,780
side of the room.

9465
02:37:53,780 --> 02:37:54,840
But on proceeding, Mr..

9466
02:37:54,840 --> 02:37:56,100
Darcy, he stopped

9467
02:37:56,100 --> 02:37:57,080
with a bow of superior

9468
02:37:57,080 --> 02:37:57,540
courtesy

9469
02:37:57,540 --> 02:37:58,260
to compliment him

9470
02:37:58,260 --> 02:37:58,940
on his dancing

9471
02:37:58,940 --> 02:38:00,140
and his partner.

9472
02:38:00,600 --> 02:38:01,400
I have been most

9473
02:38:01,400 --> 02:38:02,360
highly gratified.

9474
02:38:02,360 --> 02:38:03,560
Indeed, my dear sir.

9475
02:38:04,020 --> 02:38:05,240
Such very superior

9476
02:38:05,240 --> 02:38:06,420
dancing is not often

9477
02:38:06,420 --> 02:38:07,620
seen.

9478
02:38:07,620 --> 02:38:08,340
It is evident

9479
02:38:08,340 --> 02:38:09,020
that you belong

9480
02:38:09,020 --> 02:38:10,340
to the first circles.

9481
02:38:11,360 --> 02:38:12,200
Allow me to say,

9482
02:38:12,200 --> 02:38:12,780
however, that

9483
02:38:12,780 --> 02:38:13,640
your fair partner

9484
02:38:13,640 --> 02:38:14,840
does not disgrace you

9485
02:38:15,440 --> 02:38:16,460
and that I must hope

9486
02:38:16,460 --> 02:38:17,360
to have this pleasure

9487
02:38:17,360 --> 02:38:18,560
often repeated,

9488
02:38:18,720 --> 02:38:19,580
especially when a

9489
02:38:19,580 --> 02:38:21,060
certain desirable event.

9490
02:38:21,080 --> 02:38:22,380
My dear Miss Eliza.

9491
02:38:22,860 --> 02:38:23,420
Glancing,

9492
02:38:23,420 --> 02:38:24,620
her sister and Bingley.

9493
02:38:24,920 --> 02:38:26,120
Shall take place.

9494
02:38:26,360 --> 02:38:26,640
What?

9495
02:38:26,640 --> 02:38:27,560
Congratulations

9496
02:38:27,560 --> 02:38:28,760
will then flow in.

9497
02:38:29,160 --> 02:38:30,080
I appeal to Mr.

9498
02:38:30,080 --> 02:38:30,500
Darcy.

9499
02:38:31,500 --> 02:38:32,180
But let me not

9500
02:38:32,180 --> 02:38:33,380
interrupt you, sir.

9501
02:38:33,560 --> 02:38:34,520
You will not thank me

9502
02:38:34,520 --> 02:38:35,300
for detaining you

9503
02:38:35,300 --> 02:38:35,580
from the

9504
02:38:35,580 --> 02:38:36,560
bewitching converse

9505
02:38:36,560 --> 02:38:37,760
of that young lady

9506
02:38:37,880 --> 02:38:38,480
whose bright

9507
02:38:38,480 --> 02:38:39,240
eyes are also

9508
02:38:39,240 --> 02:38:40,440
upbraiding me.

9509
02:38:41,780 --> 02:38:42,300
The latter

9510
02:38:42,300 --> 02:38:43,220
part of this address

9511
02:38:43,220 --> 02:38:43,820
was scarcely

9512
02:38:43,820 --> 02:38:45,020
heard by Darcy.

9513
02:38:45,140 --> 02:38:45,560
But Sir

9514
02:38:45,560 --> 02:38:46,380
William's allusion

9515
02:38:46,380 --> 02:38:47,060
to his friend

9516
02:38:47,060 --> 02:38:47,840
seemed to strike him

9517
02:38:47,840 --> 02:38:48,840
forcibly,

9518
02:38:48,840 --> 02:38:49,520
and his eyes

9519
02:38:49,520 --> 02:38:50,120
were directed

9520
02:38:50,120 --> 02:38:50,300
with a

9521
02:38:50,300 --> 02:38:51,660
very serious expression

9522
02:38:51,660 --> 02:38:52,940
towards Bingley and Jane

9523
02:38:53,180 --> 02:38:53,940
who were dancing

9524
02:38:53,940 --> 02:38:54,980
together.

9525
02:38:54,980 --> 02:38:55,980
Recovering himself.

9526
02:38:55,980 --> 02:38:56,960
However, shortly

9527
02:38:56,960 --> 02:38:58,160
he turned to his partner

9528
02:38:58,340 --> 02:38:59,480
and said.

9529
02:38:59,480 --> 02:39:00,180
Sir William's

9530
02:39:00,180 --> 02:39:00,900
interruption

9531
02:39:00,900 --> 02:39:01,760
has made me forget

9532
02:39:01,760 --> 02:39:02,960
what we were talking.

9533
02:39:03,180 --> 02:39:04,120
I do not think we were

9534
02:39:04,120 --> 02:39:05,280
speaking at all.

9535
02:39:05,280 --> 02:39:05,900
Sir William

9536
02:39:05,900 --> 02:39:06,200
could not

9537
02:39:06,200 --> 02:39:06,840
have interrupted

9538
02:39:06,840 --> 02:39:07,820
two people in the wrong

9539
02:39:07,820 --> 02:39:08,660
who had less to say

9540
02:39:08,660 --> 02:39:09,860
for themselves.

9541
02:39:09,920 --> 02:39:10,640
We have tried

9542
02:39:10,640 --> 02:39:11,100
two or three

9543
02:39:11,100 --> 02:39:11,580
subjects

9544
02:39:11,580 --> 02:39:12,360
already without.

9545
02:39:12,360 --> 02:39:13,280
Success

9546
02:39:13,280 --> 02:39:13,740
and what

9547
02:39:13,740 --> 02:39:15,020
we are to talk of next.

9548
02:39:15,020 --> 02:39:16,220
I cannot imagine.

9549
02:39:16,580 --> 02:39:17,780
What think you of books?

9550
02:39:18,080 --> 02:39:19,280
Said he, smiling.

9551
02:39:19,900 --> 02:39:20,900
Perks.

9552
02:39:20,900 --> 02:39:22,080
Ho no,

9553
02:39:22,080 --> 02:39:22,640
I am sure

9554
02:39:22,640 --> 02:39:23,300
we never read

9555
02:39:23,300 --> 02:39:24,380
the same or not

9556
02:39:24,380 --> 02:39:25,580
with the same feelings.

9557
02:39:26,700 --> 02:39:27,240
I am sorry.

9558
02:39:27,240 --> 02:39:28,200
You think so?

9559
02:39:28,200 --> 02:39:29,300
But if that be the case,

9560
02:39:29,300 --> 02:39:30,060
there can at least be

9561
02:39:30,060 --> 02:39:31,260
no want of subject.

9562
02:39:31,520 --> 02:39:33,140
We compare our different

9563
02:39:33,140 --> 02:39:34,340
opinions.

9564
02:39:34,400 --> 02:39:36,140
No, I cannot talk of

9565
02:39:36,140 --> 02:39:37,400
books in a ballroom.

9566
02:39:37,700 --> 02:39:38,820
My head is always full

9567
02:39:38,820 --> 02:39:40,020
of something else.

9568
02:39:40,080 --> 02:39:40,700
The present

9569
02:39:40,700 --> 02:39:41,700
always occupies.

9570
02:39:41,700 --> 02:39:42,620
You in such scenes.

9571
02:39:42,620 --> 02:39:43,320
Does it?

9572
02:39:43,320 --> 02:39:44,120
Said he,

9573
02:39:44,120 --> 02:39:45,320
with a look of doubt.

9574
02:39:45,560 --> 02:39:46,280
Yes.

9575
02:39:46,280 --> 02:39:47,960
Always, she replied,

9576
02:39:48,180 --> 02:39:48,800
without knowing

9577
02:39:48,800 --> 02:39:50,000
what she said, for her

9578
02:39:50,000 --> 02:39:50,600
thoughts had

9579
02:39:50,600 --> 02:39:51,120
wandered

9580
02:39:51,120 --> 02:39:52,320
far from the subject

9581
02:39:52,340 --> 02:39:53,340
as soon afterwards

9582
02:39:53,340 --> 02:39:54,080
appeared by her

9583
02:39:54,080 --> 02:39:55,280
suddenly exclaiming.

9584
02:39:55,820 --> 02:39:56,700
I remember hearing you

9585
02:39:56,700 --> 02:39:57,560
once say, Mr.

9586
02:39:57,560 --> 02:39:58,680
Darcy, that you hardly

9587
02:39:58,680 --> 02:39:59,880
ever forgave

9588
02:39:59,900 --> 02:40:01,080
that your resentment

9589
02:40:01,080 --> 02:40:02,000
once created

9590
02:40:02,000 --> 02:40:03,200
was on a peaceable.

9591
02:40:03,480 --> 02:40:04,680
You are very cautious,

9592
02:40:04,680 --> 02:40:05,940
I suppose, as to its

9593
02:40:05,940 --> 02:40:07,140
being created.

9594
02:40:07,740 --> 02:40:08,700
I am.

9595
02:40:08,700 --> 02:40:09,140
Said he,

9596
02:40:09,140 --> 02:40:10,340
with a firm voice,

9597
02:40:10,880 --> 02:40:12,200
and never allow yourself

9598
02:40:12,200 --> 02:40:12,960
to be blinded

9599
02:40:12,960 --> 02:40:14,160
by prejudice.

9600
02:40:14,220 --> 02:40:15,420
I hope not.

9601
02:40:15,860 --> 02:40:16,220
It is

9602
02:40:16,220 --> 02:40:17,520
particularly incumbent

9603
02:40:17,520 --> 02:40:17,940
on those

9604
02:40:17,940 --> 02:40:18,720
who never change

9605
02:40:18,720 --> 02:40:19,640
their opinion

9606
02:40:19,640 --> 02:40:20,780
to be secure of judging

9607
02:40:20,780 --> 02:40:22,020
properly at first.

9608
02:40:23,340 --> 02:40:23,820
May I

9609
02:40:23,820 --> 02:40:24,540
ask to what

9610
02:40:24,540 --> 02:40:25,740
these questions tend.

9611
02:40:26,520 --> 02:40:26,940
Merely

9612
02:40:26,940 --> 02:40:27,720
to the illustration

9613
02:40:27,720 --> 02:40:28,920
of your character?

9614
02:40:29,040 --> 02:40:30,440
Said she endeavoring,

9615
02:40:30,440 --> 02:40:30,960
to shake off

9616
02:40:30,960 --> 02:40:32,160
her gravity.

9617
02:40:32,160 --> 02:40:32,900
I am trying.

9618
02:40:32,900 --> 02:40:34,100
To make it out.

9619
02:40:34,820 --> 02:40:35,360
And what is

9620
02:40:35,360 --> 02:40:36,480
your success?

9621
02:40:36,480 --> 02:40:37,680
She shook her head.

9622
02:40:37,980 --> 02:40:39,480
I do not get on at all.

9623
02:40:39,740 --> 02:40:41,040
I such different

9624
02:40:41,040 --> 02:40:41,700
accounts of you

9625
02:40:41,700 --> 02:40:42,300
as to puzzle

9626
02:40:42,300 --> 02:40:43,500
me exceedingly.

9627
02:40:44,280 --> 02:40:45,480
I can readily believe.

9628
02:40:45,840 --> 02:40:47,040
Answered he gravely.

9629
02:40:47,580 --> 02:40:48,660
That reports may vary

9630
02:40:48,660 --> 02:40:49,620
greatly with respect

9631
02:40:49,620 --> 02:40:50,820
to me,

9632
02:40:51,060 --> 02:40:51,540
and I could

9633
02:40:51,540 --> 02:40:52,740
wish Miss Bennet

9634
02:40:53,100 --> 02:40:53,720
that you were not

9635
02:40:53,720 --> 02:40:54,180
to sketch

9636
02:40:54,180 --> 02:40:54,780
my character

9637
02:40:54,780 --> 02:40:55,980
at the present moment,

9638
02:40:57,000 --> 02:40:57,780
as there is reason

9639
02:40:57,780 --> 02:40:58,200
to fear

9640
02:40:58,200 --> 02:40:59,100
that the performance

9641
02:40:59,100 --> 02:40:59,660
would reflect

9642
02:40:59,660 --> 02:41:00,860
no credit on either.

9643
02:41:02,240 --> 02:41:03,260
But if I do not to take

9644
02:41:03,260 --> 02:41:04,460
your likeness now,

9645
02:41:04,520 --> 02:41:05,340
I may never have

9646
02:41:05,340 --> 02:41:06,540
another opportunity.

9647
02:41:06,960 --> 02:41:08,000
I would by no means

9648
02:41:08,000 --> 02:41:08,400
suspend

9649
02:41:08,400 --> 02:41:09,500
any pleasure of yours.

9650
02:41:09,500 --> 02:41:10,700
He called the replied.

9651
02:41:11,060 --> 02:41:12,260
She said no more.

9652
02:41:12,300 --> 02:41:13,200
And they went down

9653
02:41:13,200 --> 02:41:13,920
the other dance

9654
02:41:13,920 --> 02:41:15,140
and parted in silence.

9655
02:41:15,480 --> 02:41:16,040
And on each.

9656
02:41:16,040 --> 02:41:17,300
Side dissatisfied,

9657
02:41:17,460 --> 02:41:17,660
though

9658
02:41:17,660 --> 02:41:19,020
not to an equal degree.

9659
02:41:19,440 --> 02:41:20,660
For in Dorothy's breast

9660
02:41:20,660 --> 02:41:21,500
there was a tolerable

9661
02:41:21,500 --> 02:41:22,020
powerful

9662
02:41:22,020 --> 02:41:23,220
feeling towards her.

9663
02:41:23,360 --> 02:41:24,480
Which soon procured her.

9664
02:41:24,480 --> 02:41:26,120
Pardon and directed all

9665
02:41:26,120 --> 02:41:26,780
his anger

9666
02:41:26,780 --> 02:41:27,620
against another.

9667
02:41:28,800 --> 02:41:29,060
They had

9668
02:41:29,060 --> 02:41:30,260
not long separated.

9669
02:41:30,380 --> 02:41:31,520
When Miss Bingley came

9670
02:41:31,520 --> 02:41:32,360
towards her

9671
02:41:32,360 --> 02:41:33,360
and with an expression

9672
02:41:33,360 --> 02:41:34,380
of civil disdain,

9673
02:41:34,380 --> 02:41:35,580
accosted her.

9674
02:41:35,760 --> 02:41:37,820
So, Miss Eliza,

9675
02:41:38,100 --> 02:41:38,660
I hear

9676
02:41:38,660 --> 02:41:40,100
you are quite delighted

9677
02:41:40,100 --> 02:41:41,300
with George Wickham.

9678
02:41:41,340 --> 02:41:42,420
Your sister has been

9679
02:41:42,420 --> 02:41:43,620
talking to me about him

9680
02:41:43,700 --> 02:41:44,820
and asking me a

9681
02:41:44,820 --> 02:41:46,040
thousand questions.

9682
02:41:46,400 --> 02:41:47,100
And I find that

9683
02:41:47,100 --> 02:41:47,600
the young man

9684
02:41:47,600 --> 02:41:48,300
quite forgot

9685
02:41:48,300 --> 02:41:49,020
to tell you,

9686
02:41:49,020 --> 02:41:49,500
among his

9687
02:41:49,500 --> 02:41:50,700
other communication,

9688
02:41:50,720 --> 02:41:51,180
that he was

9689
02:41:51,180 --> 02:41:52,660
the son of Old Wickham.

9690
02:41:52,800 --> 02:41:53,520
The late Mr.

9691
02:41:53,520 --> 02:41:54,720
Darcy Stewart.

9692
02:41:55,320 --> 02:41:56,420
Let me recommend you,

9693
02:41:56,420 --> 02:41:57,660
however, as a friend,

9694
02:41:57,840 --> 02:41:58,260
not to

9695
02:41:58,260 --> 02:41:59,580
give implicit confidence

9696
02:41:59,580 --> 02:42:00,860
to all his assertions

9697
02:42:01,280 --> 02:42:02,000
for as to Mr.

9698
02:42:02,000 --> 02:42:03,260
Darcy's using him ill,

9699
02:42:03,260 --> 02:42:04,820
it is perfectly false

9700
02:42:05,280 --> 02:42:06,480
for on the contrary,

9701
02:42:06,540 --> 02:42:07,620
he has always

9702
02:42:07,620 --> 02:42:08,280
been remarkably

9703
02:42:08,280 --> 02:42:09,480
kind to him.

9704
02:42:09,540 --> 02:42:09,840
Though

9705
02:42:09,840 --> 02:42:10,440
George Wickham

9706
02:42:10,440 --> 02:42:11,100
is treated Mr.

9707
02:42:11,100 --> 02:42:11,540
Darcy

9708
02:42:11,540 --> 02:42:12,240
in a most

9709
02:42:12,240 --> 02:42:13,440
infamous manner,

9710
02:42:13,940 --> 02:42:14,780
I do not know

9711
02:42:14,780 --> 02:42:15,560
the particulars,

9712
02:42:15,560 --> 02:42:16,020
but I know

9713
02:42:16,020 --> 02:42:16,740
very well that Mr.

9714
02:42:16,740 --> 02:42:17,340
Darcy is not

9715
02:42:17,340 --> 02:42:18,540
at least to blame,

9716
02:42:18,720 --> 02:42:19,840
that he cannot bear

9717
02:42:19,840 --> 02:42:20,100
to hear

9718
02:42:20,100 --> 02:42:20,400
George

9719
02:42:20,400 --> 02:42:21,300
Wickham mentioned.

9720
02:42:21,300 --> 02:42:22,100
And that though

9721
02:42:22,100 --> 02:42:22,980
my brother thought

9722
02:42:22,980 --> 02:42:23,580
that he could not

9723
02:42:23,580 --> 02:42:24,780
well avoid including him

9724
02:42:24,780 --> 02:42:25,500
in his invitation

9725
02:42:25,500 --> 02:42:26,600
to the officers,

9726
02:42:26,600 --> 02:42:27,480
he was excessively

9727
02:42:27,480 --> 02:42:28,400
glad to that

9728
02:42:28,400 --> 02:42:29,240
he had taken himself

9729
02:42:29,240 --> 02:42:30,380
out of the way.

9730
02:42:30,380 --> 02:42:31,200
His coming into

9731
02:42:31,200 --> 02:42:32,240
the country at all

9732
02:42:32,240 --> 02:42:32,400
is the

9733
02:42:32,400 --> 02:42:33,660
most insolent thing.

9734
02:42:33,660 --> 02:42:34,500
Indeed.

9735
02:42:34,500 --> 02:42:35,160
And I wonder

9736
02:42:35,160 --> 02:42:35,540
how he could

9737
02:42:35,540 --> 02:42:36,740
presume to do it.

9738
02:42:37,260 --> 02:42:38,640
I pity Miss Eliza

9739
02:42:38,880 --> 02:42:39,740
for this discovery

9740
02:42:39,740 --> 02:42:41,060
of your favorites guilt.

9741
02:42:41,420 --> 02:42:42,020
But really,

9742
02:42:42,020 --> 02:42:43,400
considering his descent,

9743
02:42:43,400 --> 02:42:44,040
one could not

9744
02:42:44,040 --> 02:42:45,360
expect much better.

9745
02:42:46,380 --> 02:42:47,460
His guilt and his

9746
02:42:47,460 --> 02:42:48,180
descent appear

9747
02:42:48,180 --> 02:42:48,900
by your account,

9748
02:42:48,900 --> 02:42:50,060
to be the same.

9749
02:42:50,060 --> 02:42:51,260
Said Elizabeth angrily.

9750
02:42:51,720 --> 02:42:52,380
For I have heard

9751
02:42:52,380 --> 02:42:52,880
you accuse him

9752
02:42:52,880 --> 02:42:53,280
of nothing

9753
02:42:53,280 --> 02:42:54,000
worse than being

9754
02:42:54,000 --> 02:42:54,660
the son of Mr.

9755
02:42:54,660 --> 02:42:55,860
Darcy Stewart.

9756
02:42:55,920 --> 02:42:56,480
And of that,

9757
02:42:56,480 --> 02:42:57,200
I can assure you,

9758
02:42:57,200 --> 02:42:58,620
he informed me himself.

9759
02:42:59,520 --> 02:43:01,500
I beg your pardon?

9760
02:43:01,880 --> 02:43:03,080
Replied Miss Bingley,

9761
02:43:03,120 --> 02:43:03,780
turning away

9762
02:43:03,780 --> 02:43:04,920
with a sneer.

9763
02:43:04,920 --> 02:43:06,800
Excuse my interference.

9764
02:43:06,980 --> 02:43:08,420
It was kindly meant

9765
02:43:09,420 --> 02:43:10,620
insolent girl.

9766
02:43:10,940 --> 02:43:11,600
Said Elizabeth

9767
02:43:11,600 --> 02:43:12,660
to herself.

9768
02:43:12,660 --> 02:43:13,500
You are much.

9769
02:43:13,500 --> 02:43:14,700
Mistaken if you expect.

9770
02:43:14,700 --> 02:43:15,440
To influence me

9771
02:43:15,440 --> 02:43:16,820
by such a paltry attack

9772
02:43:16,820 --> 02:43:18,020
as this.

9773
02:43:18,060 --> 02:43:18,920
I see nothing in it

9774
02:43:18,920 --> 02:43:19,380
but your own

9775
02:43:19,380 --> 02:43:20,300
willful ignorance

9776
02:43:20,300 --> 02:43:21,320
and the malice of Mr.

9777
02:43:21,320 --> 02:43:22,520
Darcy.

9778
02:43:22,820 --> 02:43:23,900
She then sought out

9779
02:43:23,900 --> 02:43:25,100
her eldest sister,

9780
02:43:25,200 --> 02:43:26,060
who has undertaken

9781
02:43:26,060 --> 02:43:26,880
to make inquiries

9782
02:43:26,880 --> 02:43:27,320
on the same

9783
02:43:27,320 --> 02:43:28,520
subject of Bingley.

9784
02:43:28,760 --> 02:43:29,540
Jane met her

9785
02:43:29,540 --> 02:43:30,540
with a smile of such

9786
02:43:30,540 --> 02:43:31,740
sweet complacency,

9787
02:43:31,800 --> 02:43:32,520
a glow of such

9788
02:43:32,520 --> 02:43:33,720
happy expression.

9789
02:43:33,720 --> 02:43:34,440
As sufficiently.

9790
02:43:34,440 --> 02:43:34,940
Marked how

9791
02:43:34,940 --> 02:43:36,060
well she was satisfied

9792
02:43:36,060 --> 02:43:36,860
with the occurrences

9793
02:43:36,860 --> 02:43:37,940
of the evening.

9794
02:43:37,940 --> 02:43:38,960
Elizabeth instantly

9795
02:43:38,960 --> 02:43:40,040
read her feelings,

9796
02:43:40,040 --> 02:43:40,460
and at that

9797
02:43:40,460 --> 02:43:41,400
moment solicitude

9798
02:43:41,400 --> 02:43:42,660
for Wickham resentment

9799
02:43:42,660 --> 02:43:43,580
against his enemies

9800
02:43:43,580 --> 02:43:44,760
and everything else.

9801
02:43:44,760 --> 02:43:45,360
Gave way

9802
02:43:45,360 --> 02:43:45,960
before the hope

9803
02:43:45,960 --> 02:43:46,560
of Jane's.

9804
02:43:46,560 --> 02:43:47,700
Being in the fairest way

9805
02:43:47,700 --> 02:43:48,900
for happiness.

9806
02:43:49,160 --> 02:43:50,340
I want to know,

9807
02:43:50,340 --> 02:43:50,940
said she.

9808
02:43:50,940 --> 02:43:51,680
With a countenance

9809
02:43:51,680 --> 02:43:52,520
no less smiling

9810
02:43:52,520 --> 02:43:53,720
than her sisters.

9811
02:43:53,720 --> 02:43:54,620
What do you have learned

9812
02:43:54,620 --> 02:43:55,160
about Mr.

9813
02:43:55,160 --> 02:43:56,040
Wickham?

9814
02:43:56,040 --> 02:43:56,780
But perhaps

9815
02:43:56,780 --> 02:43:57,300
you've been too

9816
02:43:57,300 --> 02:43:58,280
pleasantly engaged

9817
02:43:58,280 --> 02:43:58,680
to think of

9818
02:43:58,680 --> 02:43:59,880
any third person,

9819
02:44:00,060 --> 02:44:01,200
in which case you may be

9820
02:44:01,200 --> 02:44:02,400
sure of my pardon.

9821
02:44:03,080 --> 02:44:04,700
No, replied Jane.

9822
02:44:04,980 --> 02:44:05,600
I have not

9823
02:44:05,600 --> 02:44:06,660
forgotten him.

9824
02:44:06,660 --> 02:44:07,340
But have nothing

9825
02:44:07,340 --> 02:44:08,120
unsatisfactory

9826
02:44:08,120 --> 02:44:09,120
to tell you.

9827
02:44:09,120 --> 02:44:09,500
Mr.

9828
02:44:09,500 --> 02:44:10,260
Bingley just don't know.

9829
02:44:10,260 --> 02:44:10,640
The whole of

9830
02:44:10,640 --> 02:44:11,700
his history, and he.

9831
02:44:11,700 --> 02:44:12,060
Is quite

9832
02:44:12,060 --> 02:44:12,600
ignorant of

9833
02:44:12,600 --> 02:44:13,440
the circumstances

9834
02:44:13,440 --> 02:44:14,100
which have principally.

9835
02:44:14,100 --> 02:44:14,700
Offended Mr.

9836
02:44:14,700 --> 02:44:15,500
Darcy.

9837
02:44:15,500 --> 02:44:15,900
But he will

9838
02:44:15,900 --> 02:44:17,100
vouch for the good,

9839
02:44:17,280 --> 02:44:17,900
the probity

9840
02:44:17,900 --> 02:44:19,100
and honor of his friend,

9841
02:44:19,400 --> 02:44:20,240
and is perfectly

9842
02:44:20,240 --> 02:44:21,080
convinced. That Mr.

9843
02:44:21,080 --> 02:44:21,980
Wickham has deserved

9844
02:44:21,980 --> 02:44:22,980
much less attention

9845
02:44:22,980 --> 02:44:23,340
from Mr.

9846
02:44:23,340 --> 02:44:23,700
Darcy

9847
02:44:23,700 --> 02:44:24,900
than he has received.

9848
02:44:25,200 --> 02:44:26,100
And I am sorry to.

9849
02:44:26,100 --> 02:44:27,080
Say by account,

9850
02:44:27,080 --> 02:44:28,280
as well as his sisters.

9851
02:44:28,440 --> 02:44:28,800
Mr.

9852
02:44:28,800 --> 02:44:29,960
Wickham is by no means

9853
02:44:29,960 --> 02:44:31,220
a respectable young man.

9854
02:44:31,760 --> 02:44:32,460
I am afraid

9855
02:44:32,460 --> 02:44:32,780
he has been

9856
02:44:32,780 --> 02:44:33,900
very imprudent

9857
02:44:33,900 --> 02:44:34,860
and has deserved

9858
02:44:34,860 --> 02:44:35,460
to lose Mr.

9859
02:44:35,460 --> 02:44:36,660
Darcy's regard.

9860
02:44:37,340 --> 02:44:37,740
Mr.

9861
02:44:37,740 --> 02:44:38,040
Bingley

9862
02:44:38,040 --> 02:44:38,700
just don't know Mr.

9863
02:44:38,700 --> 02:44:39,900
Wickham himself.

9864
02:44:40,160 --> 02:44:41,780
No, he never saw him

9865
02:44:41,780 --> 02:44:42,500
till the other morning

9866
02:44:42,500 --> 02:44:43,700
at Meriton.

9867
02:44:43,980 --> 02:44:44,880
This account,

9868
02:44:44,880 --> 02:44:45,240
then, is

9869
02:44:45,240 --> 02:44:46,080
what he has received

9870
02:44:46,080 --> 02:44:46,460
from Mr.

9871
02:44:46,460 --> 02:44:47,660
Darcy.

9872
02:44:47,720 --> 02:44:49,080
I am satisfied.

9873
02:44:49,460 --> 02:44:50,320
But what does he say

9874
02:44:50,320 --> 02:44:51,520
of the living?

9875
02:44:51,780 --> 02:44:52,340
He does not

9876
02:44:52,340 --> 02:44:53,160
exactly recollect

9877
02:44:53,160 --> 02:44:54,360
the circumstances,

9878
02:44:54,420 --> 02:44:54,620
though

9879
02:44:54,620 --> 02:44:55,560
he has heard them. Mr.

9880
02:44:55,560 --> 02:44:56,760
Darcy more than once,

9881
02:44:57,000 --> 02:44:57,840
but believes

9882
02:44:57,840 --> 02:44:58,740
that it was left to him

9883
02:44:58,740 --> 02:45:00,080
conditionally only.

9884
02:45:00,980 --> 02:45:01,740
I have not

9885
02:45:01,740 --> 02:45:02,600
a doubt of Mr.

9886
02:45:02,600 --> 02:45:03,800
Bingley sincerity.

9887
02:45:04,100 --> 02:45:05,300
Said Elizabeth warmly.

9888
02:45:05,700 --> 02:45:06,960
But he must excuse my

9889
02:45:06,960 --> 02:45:07,920
not being convinced

9890
02:45:07,920 --> 02:45:08,700
by assurances.

9891
02:45:08,700 --> 02:45:09,920
Only Mr.

9892
02:45:09,920 --> 02:45:10,260
Bingley,

9893
02:45:10,260 --> 02:45:10,760
his defense

9894
02:45:10,760 --> 02:45:11,360
of his friend,

9895
02:45:11,360 --> 02:45:12,420
was a very able one,

9896
02:45:12,420 --> 02:45:13,580
I daresay,

9897
02:45:13,580 --> 02:45:14,060
but since he

9898
02:45:14,060 --> 02:45:14,660
is unacquainted

9899
02:45:14,660 --> 02:45:15,120
with several

9900
02:45:15,120 --> 02:45:16,320
parts of the story

9901
02:45:16,340 --> 02:45:17,360
and has learned the rest

9902
02:45:17,360 --> 02:45:17,760
from that

9903
02:45:17,760 --> 02:45:18,960
friend himself,

9904
02:45:19,140 --> 02:45:19,920
I shall venture to

9905
02:45:19,920 --> 02:45:20,340
still think

9906
02:45:20,340 --> 02:45:21,260
of both gentlemen

9907
02:45:21,260 --> 02:45:22,460
as I did before.

9908
02:45:22,760 --> 02:45:23,280
She then.

9909
02:45:23,280 --> 02:45:24,320
Changed the discourse

9910
02:45:24,320 --> 02:45:24,860
to one more

9911
02:45:24,860 --> 02:45:26,060
gratifying each

9912
02:45:26,280 --> 02:45:27,060
and on which

9913
02:45:27,060 --> 02:45:27,480
there could be

9914
02:45:27,480 --> 02:45:28,160
no difference of.

9915
02:45:28,160 --> 02:45:29,180
Sentiment.

9916
02:45:29,180 --> 02:45:30,080
Elizabeth listened

9917
02:45:30,080 --> 02:45:30,720
with delight

9918
02:45:30,720 --> 02:45:31,460
to the happy,

9919
02:45:31,460 --> 02:45:32,600
though modest hopes

9920
02:45:32,600 --> 02:45:33,680
which Jane entertained

9921
02:45:33,680 --> 02:45:34,020
of Mr.

9922
02:45:34,020 --> 02:45:35,220
Bingley regard,

9923
02:45:35,220 --> 02:45:35,660
and said

9924
02:45:35,660 --> 02:45:36,440
all in her power

9925
02:45:36,440 --> 02:45:36,900
to heighten

9926
02:45:36,900 --> 02:45:38,100
her confidence in it.

9927
02:45:38,460 --> 02:45:39,420
On their being joined

9928
02:45:39,420 --> 02:45:39,800
by Mr.

9929
02:45:39,800 --> 02:45:40,880
Bingley himself.

9930
02:45:40,880 --> 02:45:41,940
Elizabeth withdrew

9931
02:45:41,940 --> 02:45:43,020
to Miss Lucas.

9932
02:45:43,020 --> 02:45:43,440
To whose.

9933
02:45:43,440 --> 02:45:43,920
Inquiry

9934
02:45:43,920 --> 02:45:44,720
after the pleasantness

9935
02:45:44,720 --> 02:45:45,680
of her last partner

9936
02:45:45,680 --> 02:45:46,980
she had scarcely replied

9937
02:45:47,340 --> 02:45:47,960
before Mr.

9938
02:45:47,960 --> 02:45:49,200
Collins came up to them

9939
02:45:49,460 --> 02:45:50,180
and told her

9940
02:45:50,180 --> 02:45:51,680
with great exaltation.

9941
02:45:51,900 --> 02:45:52,280
That he had

9942
02:45:52,280 --> 02:45:52,820
just been

9943
02:45:52,820 --> 02:45:53,840
so fortunate as.

9944
02:45:53,840 --> 02:45:55,260
To make a most important

9945
02:45:55,260 --> 02:45:56,460
discovery.

9946
02:45:56,520 --> 02:45:57,840
I have found out,

9947
02:45:58,220 --> 02:45:59,280
said he,

9948
02:45:59,280 --> 02:46:00,560
by a singular accident,

9949
02:46:00,900 --> 02:46:01,800
that there is now

9950
02:46:01,800 --> 02:46:02,360
in the room

9951
02:46:02,360 --> 02:46:03,240
a near relation

9952
02:46:03,240 --> 02:46:04,380
to my patroness.

9953
02:46:04,380 --> 02:46:05,280
I happened to overhear

9954
02:46:05,280 --> 02:46:06,320
the gentleman himself

9955
02:46:06,320 --> 02:46:06,900
mentioning to

9956
02:46:06,900 --> 02:46:07,860
the young lady

9957
02:46:07,860 --> 02:46:08,700
who does the honors

9958
02:46:08,700 --> 02:46:09,300
of this house

9959
02:46:09,300 --> 02:46:09,840
the names of

9960
02:46:09,840 --> 02:46:10,580
his cousin, Mr.

9961
02:46:10,580 --> 02:46:11,960
Borg, and of her mother,

9962
02:46:11,960 --> 02:46:13,160
Lady Katharine.

9963
02:46:13,680 --> 02:46:14,640
How Wonderfully,

9964
02:46:14,640 --> 02:46:15,480
these sort of things

9965
02:46:15,480 --> 02:46:16,680
occur.

9966
02:46:16,740 --> 02:46:17,460
Who would have thought

9967
02:46:17,460 --> 02:46:18,060
of my meeting

9968
02:46:18,060 --> 02:46:18,780
with perhaps

9969
02:46:18,780 --> 02:46:19,640
a nephew of Lady

9970
02:46:19,640 --> 02:46:20,480
Katharine de Borg

9971
02:46:20,480 --> 02:46:21,300
in this assembly?

9972
02:46:22,440 --> 02:46:23,640
I am most thankful

9973
02:46:23,640 --> 02:46:24,600
the discovery is made

9974
02:46:24,600 --> 02:46:25,260
in time for me

9975
02:46:25,260 --> 02:46:26,180
to pay my respects

9976
02:46:26,180 --> 02:46:26,700
to him,

9977
02:46:26,700 --> 02:46:27,360
which I am now

9978
02:46:27,360 --> 02:46:28,520
going to do and trust.

9979
02:46:28,520 --> 02:46:29,340
He will excuse my

9980
02:46:29,340 --> 02:46:30,000
not having done it

9981
02:46:30,000 --> 02:46:31,200
before.

9982
02:46:31,320 --> 02:46:31,980
My total

9983
02:46:31,980 --> 02:46:32,580
ignorance of

9984
02:46:32,580 --> 02:46:33,420
the connection

9985
02:46:33,420 --> 02:46:34,820
must plead my apology.

9986
02:46:36,320 --> 02:46:37,100
You are not going

9987
02:46:37,100 --> 02:46:37,880
to introduce yourself

9988
02:46:37,880 --> 02:46:39,080
to Mr. Darcy.

9989
02:46:39,680 --> 02:46:40,880
Indeed I am.

9990
02:46:41,160 --> 02:46:41,820
I shall entreat

9991
02:46:41,820 --> 02:46:42,360
his pardon

9992
02:46:42,360 --> 02:46:42,960
for not having

9993
02:46:42,960 --> 02:46:44,160
done it earlier.

9994
02:46:44,240 --> 02:46:45,380
I believe him to be Lady

9995
02:46:45,380 --> 02:46:46,580
Catherine's nephew.

9996
02:46:47,060 --> 02:46:48,080
It will be in my power

9997
02:46:48,080 --> 02:46:48,780
to assure him

9998
02:46:48,780 --> 02:46:49,400
that her Ladyship

9999
02:46:49,400 --> 02:46:49,860
was quite

10000
02:46:49,860 --> 02:46:50,660
well yesterday.

10001
02:46:50,660 --> 02:46:51,860
The night.

10002
02:46:52,440 --> 02:46:53,900
Elizabeth tried hard to.

10003
02:46:53,900 --> 02:46:54,480
Dissuade him

10004
02:46:54,480 --> 02:46:55,640
from such a scheme.

10005
02:46:55,640 --> 02:46:56,720
Assuring him that Mr.

10006
02:46:56,720 --> 02:46:57,620
Darcy would consider

10007
02:46:57,620 --> 02:46:58,340
his addressing him

10008
02:46:58,340 --> 02:46:59,300
without introduction

10009
02:46:59,300 --> 02:46:59,600
as an

10010
02:46:59,600 --> 02:47:00,800
impertinent freedom,

10011
02:47:00,960 --> 02:47:01,980
rather than a compliment

10012
02:47:01,980 --> 02:47:03,320
to his aunt that it was

10013
02:47:03,320 --> 02:47:04,100
not in the least

10014
02:47:04,100 --> 02:47:04,760
necessary.

10015
02:47:04,760 --> 02:47:05,120
There should be

10016
02:47:05,120 --> 02:47:05,720
any notice

10017
02:47:05,720 --> 02:47:06,920
on either side.

10018
02:47:06,920 --> 02:47:07,500
And that if it.

10019
02:47:07,500 --> 02:47:08,700
Were, it must belong

10020
02:47:08,700 --> 02:47:09,060
to Mr.

10021
02:47:09,060 --> 02:47:09,740
Darcy,

10022
02:47:09,740 --> 02:47:10,460
the superior

10023
02:47:10,460 --> 02:47:11,580
in consequence to.

10024
02:47:11,580 --> 02:47:12,780
Begin the acquaintance.

10025
02:47:13,160 --> 02:47:13,500
Mr.

10026
02:47:13,500 --> 02:47:14,760
Collins listened to her

10027
02:47:14,760 --> 02:47:14,940
with the

10028
02:47:14,940 --> 02:47:15,700
determined error

10029
02:47:15,700 --> 02:47:16,220
of following

10030
02:47:16,220 --> 02:47:17,420
his own inclination.

10031
02:47:17,580 --> 02:47:18,360
And when she ceased

10032
02:47:18,360 --> 02:47:19,580
speaking, replied

10033
02:47:19,580 --> 02:47:20,780
thus.

10034
02:47:20,780 --> 02:47:22,040
My dear Miss Elizabeth,

10035
02:47:22,440 --> 02:47:22,820
I have the

10036
02:47:22,820 --> 02:47:23,600
highest opinion

10037
02:47:23,600 --> 02:47:24,120
in the world

10038
02:47:24,120 --> 02:47:24,380
of your

10039
02:47:24,380 --> 02:47:25,580
excellent judgment

10040
02:47:25,760 --> 02:47:26,780
in all matters

10041
02:47:26,780 --> 02:47:27,560
within the scope

10042
02:47:27,560 --> 02:47:28,760
of your understanding.

10043
02:47:29,060 --> 02:47:30,420
But permit me to say

10044
02:47:30,720 --> 02:47:31,400
that there must be

10045
02:47:31,400 --> 02:47:32,600
a wide difference.

10046
02:47:32,600 --> 02:47:33,600
The established forms

10047
02:47:33,600 --> 02:47:34,500
of ceremony

10048
02:47:34,500 --> 02:47:35,540
amongst the laity

10049
02:47:35,540 --> 02:47:35,960
and those

10050
02:47:35,960 --> 02:47:36,560
which regulate

10051
02:47:36,560 --> 02:47:37,760
the clergy.

10052
02:47:38,060 --> 02:47:38,480
Forgive me

10053
02:47:38,480 --> 02:47:39,260
leave to observe that

10054
02:47:39,260 --> 02:47:39,860
I consider

10055
02:47:39,860 --> 02:47:41,120
the clerical office

10056
02:47:41,120 --> 02:47:42,200
as equal in point.

10057
02:47:42,200 --> 02:47:43,740
Dignity with the highest

10058
02:47:43,740 --> 02:47:44,780
rank in the kingdom,

10059
02:47:46,040 --> 02:47:46,880
provided that a

10060
02:47:46,880 --> 02:47:47,220
proper

10061
02:47:47,220 --> 02:47:48,380
humility of behavior

10062
02:47:48,380 --> 02:47:49,620
is at the same time

10063
02:47:49,620 --> 02:47:50,820
maintained.

10064
02:47:51,240 --> 02:47:51,680
You must

10065
02:47:51,680 --> 02:47:52,920
therefore allow me

10066
02:47:52,920 --> 02:47:53,880
to follow the dictates

10067
02:47:53,880 --> 02:47:54,600
of my conscience

10068
02:47:54,600 --> 02:47:55,800
on this occasion,

10069
02:47:56,420 --> 02:47:57,440
which lead me to perform

10070
02:47:57,440 --> 02:47:58,040
what I look on

10071
02:47:58,040 --> 02:47:59,240
as a point of duty.

10072
02:47:59,580 --> 02:48:00,720
Pardon me for neglecting

10073
02:48:00,720 --> 02:48:01,220
to profit

10074
02:48:01,220 --> 02:48:02,420
by your advice,

10075
02:48:02,600 --> 02:48:03,200
which on every

10076
02:48:03,200 --> 02:48:04,260
other subject shall be

10077
02:48:04,260 --> 02:48:05,460
my constant guide.

10078
02:48:05,540 --> 02:48:05,780
Though

10079
02:48:05,780 --> 02:48:06,260
in the case

10080
02:48:06,260 --> 02:48:06,840
before us,

10081
02:48:06,840 --> 02:48:07,800
I consider myself

10082
02:48:07,800 --> 02:48:09,180
more fitted by education

10083
02:48:09,180 --> 02:48:10,380
and habitual study

10084
02:48:10,560 --> 02:48:11,340
to decide

10085
02:48:11,340 --> 02:48:12,120
what is right

10086
02:48:12,120 --> 02:48:12,920
than a young lady

10087
02:48:12,920 --> 02:48:14,120
like yourself.

10088
02:48:14,300 --> 02:48:15,500
And with a low bough.

10089
02:48:15,600 --> 02:48:16,320
He left her

10090
02:48:16,320 --> 02:48:17,180
to attack Mr.

10091
02:48:17,180 --> 02:48:18,000
Darcy,

10092
02:48:18,000 --> 02:48:18,720
whose reception

10093
02:48:18,720 --> 02:48:19,460
of his advances.

10094
02:48:19,460 --> 02:48:20,660
She eagerly watched.

10095
02:48:20,900 --> 02:48:21,380
And whose.

10096
02:48:21,380 --> 02:48:22,580
Astonishment at being so

10097
02:48:22,580 --> 02:48:23,040
addressed

10098
02:48:23,040 --> 02:48:24,240
was very evident.

10099
02:48:24,440 --> 02:48:25,520
Her cousin prefaced

10100
02:48:25,520 --> 02:48:26,060
his speech

10101
02:48:26,060 --> 02:48:27,260
with a solemn vow,

10102
02:48:27,360 --> 02:48:27,740
and though

10103
02:48:27,740 --> 02:48:28,440
she could not hear

10104
02:48:28,440 --> 02:48:29,940
a word of it, she felt

10105
02:48:29,940 --> 02:48:31,140
as if hearing it all

10106
02:48:31,280 --> 02:48:31,920
and saw in.

10107
02:48:31,920 --> 02:48:32,880
The motion of his lips

10108
02:48:32,880 --> 02:48:34,320
the words apology

10109
02:48:34,760 --> 02:48:35,640
Hansford

10110
02:48:35,640 --> 02:48:36,840
and Lady

10111
02:48:36,840 --> 02:48:38,040
Catherine de Berg.

10112
02:48:38,720 --> 02:48:39,680
It vexed her to

10113
02:48:39,680 --> 02:48:40,880
see him expose

10114
02:48:40,940 --> 02:48:42,120
to such a man.

10115
02:48:42,120 --> 02:48:42,440
Mr.

10116
02:48:42,440 --> 02:48:43,520
Darcy was eyeing him

10117
02:48:43,520 --> 02:48:44,460
with unrestrained

10118
02:48:44,460 --> 02:48:45,300
wonder,

10119
02:48:45,300 --> 02:48:46,460
and when at last Mr.

10120
02:48:46,460 --> 02:48:47,240
Collins allowed him

10121
02:48:47,240 --> 02:48:48,780
time to speak, replied

10122
02:48:48,780 --> 02:48:49,440
with an air of

10123
02:48:49,440 --> 02:48:50,640
distant civility.

10124
02:48:51,200 --> 02:48:51,540
Mr.

10125
02:48:51,540 --> 02:48:51,980
Collins,

10126
02:48:51,980 --> 02:48:52,440
however, was

10127
02:48:52,440 --> 02:48:53,180
not discouraged

10128
02:48:53,180 --> 02:48:54,300
from speaking again,

10129
02:48:54,300 --> 02:48:54,680
and Mr.

10130
02:48:54,680 --> 02:48:55,880
Darcy's contempt seemed

10131
02:48:55,880 --> 02:48:56,940
abundantly increasing

10132
02:48:56,940 --> 02:48:57,440
with the length

10133
02:48:57,440 --> 02:48:58,640
of his second speech.

10134
02:48:58,760 --> 02:48:59,780
And at the end of it

10135
02:48:59,780 --> 02:49:00,660
he only made him a.

10136
02:49:00,660 --> 02:49:01,640
Slight bow

10137
02:49:01,640 --> 02:49:02,900
and moved another way.

10138
02:49:03,420 --> 02:49:03,720
Mr.

10139
02:49:03,720 --> 02:49:04,260
Collins

10140
02:49:04,260 --> 02:49:04,880
then returned

10141
02:49:04,880 --> 02:49:06,080
to Elizabeth.

10142
02:49:06,140 --> 02:49:07,460
I have no reason,

10143
02:49:07,460 --> 02:49:09,300
I assure you, said he,

10144
02:49:09,560 --> 02:49:10,760
to be dissatisfied

10145
02:49:10,920 --> 02:49:12,000
with my reception.

10146
02:49:12,000 --> 02:49:12,380
Mr.

10147
02:49:12,380 --> 02:49:13,800
Darcy seemed much

10148
02:49:13,800 --> 02:49:14,480
pleased with

10149
02:49:14,480 --> 02:49:15,360
the attention.

10150
02:49:15,360 --> 02:49:16,200
He answered me

10151
02:49:16,200 --> 02:49:17,540
with the utmost civility

10152
02:49:17,700 --> 02:49:18,840
and even paid me

10153
02:49:18,840 --> 02:49:19,340
the compliment

10154
02:49:19,340 --> 02:49:19,820
of saying that

10155
02:49:19,820 --> 02:49:20,840
he was so well

10156
02:49:20,840 --> 02:49:21,740
convinced of Lady

10157
02:49:21,740 --> 02:49:22,940
Katherine's discernment

10158
02:49:23,040 --> 02:49:23,840
as to be certain

10159
02:49:23,840 --> 02:49:24,740
she could never bestow

10160
02:49:24,740 --> 02:49:26,160
a favor unworthy.

10161
02:49:26,660 --> 02:49:27,420
It was really a

10162
02:49:27,420 --> 02:49:28,620
very handsome thought

10163
02:49:28,980 --> 02:49:29,960
upon the whole.

10164
02:49:29,960 --> 02:49:31,500
I am much with him.

10165
02:49:32,520 --> 02:49:33,440
As Elizabeth had

10166
02:49:33,440 --> 02:49:33,960
no longer

10167
02:49:33,960 --> 02:49:34,580
any interest

10168
02:49:34,580 --> 02:49:35,780
of her own to pursue.

10169
02:49:35,840 --> 02:49:36,920
She turned her attention

10170
02:49:36,920 --> 02:49:37,920
almost entirely

10171
02:49:37,920 --> 02:49:39,020
on her sister and Mr.

10172
02:49:39,020 --> 02:49:39,740
Bingley

10173
02:49:39,740 --> 02:49:40,520
and the train

10174
02:49:40,520 --> 02:49:41,700
of agreeable reflections

10175
02:49:41,700 --> 02:49:42,000
which her

10176
02:49:42,000 --> 02:49:42,980
observations gave

10177
02:49:42,980 --> 02:49:44,180
birth to, made her

10178
02:49:44,180 --> 02:49:45,620
perhaps almost as happy

10179
02:49:45,620 --> 02:49:46,580
as Jane.

10180
02:49:46,580 --> 02:49:47,860
She saw her in ideas,

10181
02:49:47,880 --> 02:49:48,420
settled in

10182
02:49:48,420 --> 02:49:49,500
that very house

10183
02:49:49,500 --> 02:49:50,700
in all the Felicity

10184
02:49:50,700 --> 02:49:51,240
a marriage of

10185
02:49:51,240 --> 02:49:51,960
true affection

10186
02:49:51,960 --> 02:49:52,940
could bestow.

10187
02:49:52,940 --> 02:49:54,180
And she felt capable.

10188
02:49:54,180 --> 02:49:55,500
Under such circumstances

10189
02:49:55,740 --> 02:49:56,880
of endeavoring even

10190
02:49:56,880 --> 02:49:57,360
to like

10191
02:49:57,360 --> 02:49:58,560
being these two sisters.

10192
02:49:59,060 --> 02:49:59,660
Her mother's

10193
02:49:59,660 --> 02:50:00,860
thought she saw

10194
02:50:00,860 --> 02:50:02,060
were bent the same way,

10195
02:50:02,300 --> 02:50:03,200
and she determined

10196
02:50:03,200 --> 02:50:03,860
not to venture

10197
02:50:03,860 --> 02:50:04,940
near her, lest

10198
02:50:04,940 --> 02:50:06,260
she might hear too much.

10199
02:50:06,740 --> 02:50:07,580
When they sat down

10200
02:50:07,580 --> 02:50:08,000
to supper.

10201
02:50:08,000 --> 02:50:08,660
Therefore,

10202
02:50:08,660 --> 02:50:09,440
she considered it

10203
02:50:09,440 --> 02:50:11,160
a most unlucky Innes,

10204
02:50:11,160 --> 02:50:12,000
which placed them

10205
02:50:12,000 --> 02:50:13,200
within one of each other

10206
02:50:13,440 --> 02:50:14,180
and deeply

10207
02:50:14,180 --> 02:50:15,260
what she vexed to find

10208
02:50:15,260 --> 02:50:15,720
that her mother

10209
02:50:15,720 --> 02:50:16,220
was talking

10210
02:50:16,220 --> 02:50:17,420
to that one person.

10211
02:50:17,540 --> 02:50:18,660
Lady Lucas.

10212
02:50:18,660 --> 02:50:19,800
Freely, openly

10213
02:50:19,800 --> 02:50:20,820
and of nothing

10214
02:50:20,820 --> 02:50:21,840
but her expectation

10215
02:50:21,840 --> 02:50:22,740
that Jane would soon

10216
02:50:22,740 --> 02:50:23,660
be married to Mr.

10217
02:50:23,660 --> 02:50:24,560
Bingley.

10218
02:50:24,560 --> 02:50:25,040
It was an.

10219
02:50:25,040 --> 02:50:26,240
Animating subject,

10220
02:50:26,340 --> 02:50:26,820
and Mrs.

10221
02:50:26,820 --> 02:50:27,420
Bennett seemed

10222
02:50:27,420 --> 02:50:28,160
incapable of.

10223
02:50:28,160 --> 02:50:29,160
Fatigue while.

10224
02:50:29,160 --> 02:50:29,820
Enumerating

10225
02:50:29,820 --> 02:50:30,540
the advantages

10226
02:50:30,540 --> 02:50:31,520
of the match.

10227
02:50:31,520 --> 02:50:32,660
His being such.

10228
02:50:32,660 --> 02:50:33,840
A charming young man

10229
02:50:33,840 --> 02:50:35,300
and so rich and living.

10230
02:50:35,300 --> 02:50:36,380
But three miles

10231
02:50:36,380 --> 02:50:36,960
from them

10232
02:50:36,960 --> 02:50:37,860
were the first points

10233
02:50:37,860 --> 02:50:39,060
of self granulation.

10234
02:50:39,200 --> 02:50:39,800
And then it was

10235
02:50:39,800 --> 02:50:40,640
such a comfort.

10236
02:50:40,640 --> 02:50:40,880
Think

10237
02:50:40,880 --> 02:50:42,140
how fond the two sisters

10238
02:50:42,140 --> 02:50:43,040
were of Jane,

10239
02:50:43,040 --> 02:50:43,820
and to be certain

10240
02:50:43,820 --> 02:50:44,280
that they must

10241
02:50:44,280 --> 02:50:45,200
desire the connection

10242
02:50:45,200 --> 02:50:46,400
as much as she could do.

10243
02:50:46,700 --> 02:50:47,720
It was, moreover,

10244
02:50:47,720 --> 02:50:48,840
such a promising thing

10245
02:50:48,840 --> 02:50:49,320
for her

10246
02:50:49,320 --> 02:50:50,300
younger daughters,

10247
02:50:50,300 --> 02:50:51,360
as Jane's marrying

10248
02:50:51,360 --> 02:50:52,220
so greatly must

10249
02:50:52,220 --> 02:50:52,560
throw them

10250
02:50:52,560 --> 02:50:53,340
in the way of other

10251
02:50:53,340 --> 02:50:54,360
rich men.

10252
02:50:54,360 --> 02:50:55,380
And lastly,

10253
02:50:55,380 --> 02:50:56,340
it was so pleasant

10254
02:50:56,340 --> 02:50:57,120
at her time of life

10255
02:50:57,120 --> 02:50:57,480
to be able

10256
02:50:57,480 --> 02:50:58,160
to consign her

10257
02:50:58,160 --> 02:50:59,040
single daughters

10258
02:50:59,040 --> 02:50:59,460
to the care

10259
02:50:59,460 --> 02:51:00,540
of their sister,

10260
02:51:00,540 --> 02:51:01,100
that she might

10261
02:51:01,100 --> 02:51:01,740
not be obliged

10262
02:51:01,740 --> 02:51:02,540
to go into company

10263
02:51:02,540 --> 02:51:03,740
more than she liked.

10264
02:51:03,860 --> 02:51:04,160
It was.

10265
02:51:04,160 --> 02:51:04,680
Necessary

10266
02:51:04,680 --> 02:51:04,940
to make

10267
02:51:04,940 --> 02:51:05,720
this circumstance

10268
02:51:05,720 --> 02:51:06,780
a matter of pleasure,

10269
02:51:06,780 --> 02:51:07,260
because.

10270
02:51:07,260 --> 02:51:08,180
On such occasions

10271
02:51:08,180 --> 02:51:09,320
it is the etiquette.

10272
02:51:09,320 --> 02:51:10,220
But no one was

10273
02:51:10,220 --> 02:51:11,300
less likely than Mrs.

10274
02:51:11,300 --> 02:51:12,420
Bennett to find comfort

10275
02:51:12,420 --> 02:51:13,520
and staying home at any

10276
02:51:13,520 --> 02:51:14,720
period of her life.

10277
02:51:14,900 --> 02:51:15,560
She concluded

10278
02:51:15,560 --> 02:51:16,460
with many good wishes

10279
02:51:16,460 --> 02:51:17,220
that Lady Lucas

10280
02:51:17,220 --> 02:51:17,700
might soon

10281
02:51:17,700 --> 02:51:18,900
be equally fortunate.

10282
02:51:19,160 --> 02:51:20,180
Though evidently

10283
02:51:20,180 --> 02:51:21,200
triumphantly believing

10284
02:51:21,200 --> 02:51:21,480
there was

10285
02:51:21,480 --> 02:51:22,680
no chance of it

10286
02:51:23,000 --> 02:51:23,640
in vain.

10287
02:51:23,640 --> 02:51:24,480
Did Elizabeth endeavor

10288
02:51:24,480 --> 02:51:25,500
to check the rapidity

10289
02:51:25,500 --> 02:51:26,660
of her mother's words

10290
02:51:26,660 --> 02:51:27,480
or persuade her

10291
02:51:27,480 --> 02:51:28,100
to describe her?

10292
02:51:28,100 --> 02:51:28,640
Felicity,

10293
02:51:28,640 --> 02:51:29,580
in a less audible

10294
02:51:29,580 --> 02:51:31,040
whisper for to her

10295
02:51:31,040 --> 02:51:32,480
inexpressible vexation?

10296
02:51:32,760 --> 02:51:33,540
She could perceive

10297
02:51:33,540 --> 02:51:34,160
that the chief of

10298
02:51:34,160 --> 02:51:35,360
it was overheard by Mr.

10299
02:51:35,360 --> 02:51:36,060
Darcy,

10300
02:51:36,060 --> 02:51:36,500
who sat

10301
02:51:36,500 --> 02:51:37,700
opposite to them.

10302
02:51:37,800 --> 02:51:38,600
Her mother only

10303
02:51:38,600 --> 02:51:39,300
scolded her

10304
02:51:39,300 --> 02:51:40,500
for being nonsensical.

10305
02:51:41,000 --> 02:51:41,780
What is Mr.

10306
02:51:41,780 --> 02:51:42,900
Darcy to me?

10307
02:51:42,900 --> 02:51:43,560
Pray that

10308
02:51:43,560 --> 02:51:44,100
I should be

10309
02:51:44,100 --> 02:51:45,140
afraid of him.

10310
02:51:45,140 --> 02:51:46,400
I am sure we owe him

10311
02:51:46,400 --> 02:51:46,880
no such

10312
02:51:46,880 --> 02:51:48,080
particular civility

10313
02:51:48,140 --> 02:51:49,040
as to be obliged

10314
02:51:49,040 --> 02:51:49,620
to say nothing.

10315
02:51:49,620 --> 02:51:51,000
He not like to hear.

10316
02:51:51,840 --> 02:51:52,940
For heaven's sake,

10317
02:51:52,940 --> 02:51:54,240
madam, speak lower.

10318
02:51:54,680 --> 02:51:55,860
What advantage can.

10319
02:51:55,860 --> 02:51:56,120
It be

10320
02:51:56,120 --> 02:51:57,240
for you to offend Mr.

10321
02:51:57,240 --> 02:51:58,100
Darcy?

10322
02:51:58,100 --> 02:51:58,560
You will never

10323
02:51:58,560 --> 02:51:59,400
recommend yourself

10324
02:51:59,400 --> 02:52:00,000
to his friend

10325
02:52:00,000 --> 02:52:01,200
by so doing.

10326
02:52:01,680 --> 02:52:02,220
Nothing that

10327
02:52:02,220 --> 02:52:02,700
she could say,

10328
02:52:02,700 --> 02:52:03,060
however,

10329
02:52:03,060 --> 02:52:04,260
had any influence.

10330
02:52:04,340 --> 02:52:05,540
Her mother would talk of

10331
02:52:05,540 --> 02:52:05,940
her views

10332
02:52:05,940 --> 02:52:06,380
in the same

10333
02:52:06,380 --> 02:52:07,580
intelligible tone.

10334
02:52:07,940 --> 02:52:09,020
Elizabeth blushed

10335
02:52:09,020 --> 02:52:09,900
and blushed again

10336
02:52:09,900 --> 02:52:11,240
with shame and vexation.

10337
02:52:11,600 --> 02:52:12,360
She could not help.

10338
02:52:12,360 --> 02:52:12,740
Frequently

10339
02:52:12,740 --> 02:52:13,880
glancing her eye at Mr.

10340
02:52:13,880 --> 02:52:14,600
Darcy,

10341
02:52:14,600 --> 02:52:15,600
though every glance

10342
02:52:15,600 --> 02:52:16,160
convinced her

10343
02:52:16,160 --> 02:52:17,280
of what she dreaded,

10344
02:52:17,280 --> 02:52:17,640
for though

10345
02:52:17,640 --> 02:52:18,380
he was not always

10346
02:52:18,380 --> 02:52:19,500
looking at her mother.

10347
02:52:19,500 --> 02:52:20,240
She Was convinced

10348
02:52:20,240 --> 02:52:20,880
that his attention

10349
02:52:20,880 --> 02:52:21,960
was invariably fixed

10350
02:52:21,960 --> 02:52:22,860
on her.

10351
02:52:22,860 --> 02:52:23,660
The expression of his.

10352
02:52:23,660 --> 02:52:24,840
Face changed gradually,

10353
02:52:24,840 --> 02:52:26,040
from indignant contempt.

10354
02:52:26,220 --> 02:52:27,260
To a composed and.

10355
02:52:27,260 --> 02:52:28,460
Steady gravity.

10356
02:52:28,640 --> 02:52:29,840
At length, however,

10357
02:52:29,940 --> 02:52:30,260
Bennet

10358
02:52:30,260 --> 02:52:31,460
had no more to say,

10359
02:52:31,500 --> 02:52:32,600
and Lady Lucas,

10360
02:52:32,600 --> 02:52:33,260
who had been long

10361
02:52:33,260 --> 02:52:33,740
yawning

10362
02:52:33,740 --> 02:52:34,400
at the repetition

10363
02:52:34,400 --> 02:52:34,920
of delights

10364
02:52:34,920 --> 02:52:35,300
which she saw

10365
02:52:35,300 --> 02:52:35,880
no likelihood

10366
02:52:35,880 --> 02:52:37,140
of sharing, was left

10367
02:52:37,140 --> 02:52:37,800
to the comforts

10368
02:52:37,800 --> 02:52:39,200
of cold ham and chicken.

10369
02:52:39,720 --> 02:52:40,620
Elizabeth now

10370
02:52:40,620 --> 02:52:41,820
began to revive.

10371
02:52:41,960 --> 02:52:42,680
But not long

10372
02:52:42,680 --> 02:52:43,280
was the interval

10373
02:52:43,280 --> 02:52:44,580
of tranquility for

10374
02:52:44,580 --> 02:52:45,780
when supper was over.

10375
02:52:45,780 --> 02:52:46,800
Singing was talked.

10376
02:52:46,800 --> 02:52:47,340
Of.

10377
02:52:47,340 --> 02:52:47,820
And she had

10378
02:52:47,820 --> 02:52:48,620
the mortification

10379
02:52:48,620 --> 02:52:49,860
of seeing, after

10380
02:52:49,860 --> 02:52:51,060
very little entreaty,

10381
02:52:51,200 --> 02:52:52,340
preparing to oblige

10382
02:52:52,340 --> 02:52:53,420
the company.

10383
02:52:53,420 --> 02:52:53,660
By.

10384
02:52:53,660 --> 02:52:54,840
Many significant looks

10385
02:52:54,840 --> 02:52:56,040
and silent entreaties.

10386
02:52:56,120 --> 02:52:56,840
Did she endeavor

10387
02:52:56,840 --> 02:52:57,300
to prevent

10388
02:52:57,300 --> 02:52:57,540
such a

10389
02:52:57,540 --> 02:52:58,740
proof of complacence

10390
02:52:58,860 --> 02:52:59,960
but in vain?

10391
02:52:59,960 --> 02:53:00,540
Mary would

10392
02:53:00,540 --> 02:53:01,740
not understand then

10393
02:53:01,980 --> 02:53:02,960
such an opportunity

10394
02:53:02,960 --> 02:53:03,560
of exhibiting

10395
02:53:03,560 --> 02:53:04,760
was delightful to her,

10396
02:53:04,940 --> 02:53:06,240
and she began her song.

10397
02:53:06,720 --> 02:53:07,640
Elizabeth's eyes

10398
02:53:07,640 --> 02:53:08,420
were fixed on, her

10399
02:53:08,420 --> 02:53:08,960
with most

10400
02:53:08,960 --> 02:53:10,160
painful sensations,

10401
02:53:10,500 --> 02:53:11,160
and she watched

10402
02:53:11,160 --> 02:53:11,760
her progress

10403
02:53:11,760 --> 02:53:11,960
through the

10404
02:53:11,960 --> 02:53:12,860
several stanzas

10405
02:53:12,860 --> 02:53:13,640
with an impatience,

10406
02:53:13,640 --> 02:53:14,180
which was very

10407
02:53:14,180 --> 02:53:14,840
ill rewarded

10408
02:53:14,840 --> 02:53:16,620
at their close for Mary.

10409
02:53:16,640 --> 02:53:17,340
On receiving

10410
02:53:17,340 --> 02:53:17,760
amongst the

10411
02:53:17,760 --> 02:53:18,320
thanks of the.

10412
02:53:18,320 --> 02:53:18,920
Table

10413
02:53:18,920 --> 02:53:19,920
the hint of a hope.

10414
02:53:19,920 --> 02:53:20,340
That she might

10415
02:53:20,340 --> 02:53:20,960
be prevailed on

10416
02:53:20,960 --> 02:53:22,160
to favor them again.

10417
02:53:22,260 --> 02:53:23,040
After the pause.

10418
02:53:23,040 --> 02:53:23,900
Of half a minute

10419
02:53:23,900 --> 02:53:25,100
began another.

10420
02:53:25,260 --> 02:53:26,280
Mary's powers

10421
02:53:26,280 --> 02:53:27,180
were by no. Means.

10422
02:53:27,180 --> 02:53:28,560
Fitted for a display.

10423
02:53:28,880 --> 02:53:30,000
Her voice was weak

10424
02:53:30,000 --> 02:53:31,320
and her manner affected.

10425
02:53:31,740 --> 02:53:32,660
Elizabeth was

10426
02:53:32,660 --> 02:53:33,800
in agonies.

10427
02:53:33,800 --> 02:53:34,320
She looked at.

10428
02:53:34,320 --> 02:53:35,300
Jane to see how she.

10429
02:53:35,300 --> 02:53:35,960
Bore it.

10430
02:53:35,960 --> 02:53:36,620
But Jane was

10431
02:53:36,620 --> 02:53:37,280
very composed,

10432
02:53:37,280 --> 02:53:37,520
oddly,

10433
02:53:37,520 --> 02:53:38,720
talking to Bingley.

10434
02:53:38,760 --> 02:53:39,740
She looked at his two.

10435
02:53:39,740 --> 02:53:41,060
Sisters and saw them

10436
02:53:41,060 --> 02:53:42,320
making signs of derision

10437
02:53:42,320 --> 02:53:43,200
at each other

10438
02:53:43,200 --> 02:53:44,400
and at Darcy,

10439
02:53:44,420 --> 02:53:45,480
who continued, however

10440
02:53:45,480 --> 02:53:46,140
imperturbable,

10441
02:53:46,140 --> 02:53:47,160
the grave.

10442
02:53:47,160 --> 02:53:48,200
She looked at her father

10443
02:53:48,200 --> 02:53:48,740
to entreaties,

10444
02:53:48,740 --> 02:53:49,920
interference. Lest.

10445
02:53:49,920 --> 02:53:50,540
Mary should be

10446
02:53:50,540 --> 02:53:51,740
singing all night.

10447
02:53:52,040 --> 02:53:53,120
He took the hint.

10448
02:53:53,120 --> 02:53:54,020
And when Mary had

10449
02:53:54,020 --> 02:53:54,440
finished, her

10450
02:53:54,440 --> 02:53:55,700
second song said

10451
02:53:55,700 --> 02:53:56,900
aloud.

10452
02:53:57,000 --> 02:53:57,560
That will do

10453
02:53:57,560 --> 02:53:58,760
extremely well, child.

10454
02:53:58,920 --> 02:53:59,880
You have delighted us

10455
02:53:59,880 --> 02:54:00,960
long enough.

10456
02:54:00,960 --> 02:54:01,500
Let the other

10457
02:54:01,500 --> 02:54:02,060
young ladies

10458
02:54:02,060 --> 02:54:03,260
have time to exhibit.

10459
02:54:03,660 --> 02:54:04,640
Mary, though

10460
02:54:04,640 --> 02:54:05,840
pretending not to hear,

10461
02:54:06,020 --> 02:54:07,620
was disconcerted.

10462
02:54:07,920 --> 02:54:08,760
And Elizabeth.

10463
02:54:08,760 --> 02:54:09,800
Sorry for her.

10464
02:54:09,800 --> 02:54:10,340
And sorry

10465
02:54:10,340 --> 02:54:11,540
for her father's speech.

10466
02:54:11,660 --> 02:54:12,300
Was afraid

10467
02:54:12,300 --> 02:54:13,400
her anxiety had done

10468
02:54:13,400 --> 02:54:14,420
no good.

10469
02:54:14,420 --> 02:54:15,540
Others of the party

10470
02:54:15,540 --> 02:54:16,740
were now applied to.

10471
02:54:16,980 --> 02:54:17,840
If I.

10472
02:54:17,840 --> 02:54:18,320
Said Mr.

10473
02:54:18,320 --> 02:54:19,220
Collins.

10474
02:54:19,220 --> 02:54:20,060
Were so fortunate

10475
02:54:20,060 --> 02:54:21,080
as to be able to sing,

10476
02:54:21,080 --> 02:54:21,560
I should have

10477
02:54:21,560 --> 02:54:22,340
great pleasure.

10478
02:54:22,340 --> 02:54:23,240
I am sure

10479
02:54:23,240 --> 02:54:24,260
in obliging the company

10480
02:54:24,260 --> 02:54:25,460
with an heir,

10481
02:54:25,560 --> 02:54:26,600
for I consider

10482
02:54:26,600 --> 02:54:27,080
as a very

10483
02:54:27,080 --> 02:54:28,200
innocent diversion

10484
02:54:28,200 --> 02:54:29,420
and perfectly compatible

10485
02:54:29,420 --> 02:54:29,640
with the

10486
02:54:29,640 --> 02:54:30,180
profession of

10487
02:54:30,180 --> 02:54:30,840
a clergyman.

10488
02:54:32,240 --> 02:54:32,900
I do not mean,

10489
02:54:32,900 --> 02:54:33,800
however, to assert

10490
02:54:33,800 --> 02:54:34,920
that we can be justified

10491
02:54:34,920 --> 02:54:35,460
in devoting

10492
02:54:35,460 --> 02:54:35,960
too much

10493
02:54:35,960 --> 02:54:37,160
our time to music,

10494
02:54:38,240 --> 02:54:38,640
for there are

10495
02:54:38,640 --> 02:54:39,680
certainly other things

10496
02:54:39,680 --> 02:54:40,880
to be attended to.

10497
02:54:41,160 --> 02:54:42,240
The rector of a parish

10498
02:54:42,240 --> 02:54:43,440
has much to do.

10499
02:54:43,760 --> 02:54:44,900
In the first place

10500
02:54:44,900 --> 02:54:45,800
he must make such

10501
02:54:45,800 --> 02:54:46,920
agreement for tithes

10502
02:54:46,920 --> 02:54:47,900
as may be beneficial

10503
02:54:47,900 --> 02:54:48,800
to himself

10504
02:54:48,800 --> 02:54:49,620
and not offensive

10505
02:54:49,620 --> 02:54:50,820
to his patron.

10506
02:54:50,880 --> 02:54:51,620
He must write

10507
02:54:51,620 --> 02:54:52,820
his own sermons,

10508
02:54:53,000 --> 02:54:53,540
and the time

10509
02:54:53,540 --> 02:54:54,080
that remains

10510
02:54:54,080 --> 02:54:54,900
will not be too much

10511
02:54:54,900 --> 02:54:56,100
for his parish duties

10512
02:54:56,400 --> 02:54:57,120
and the care

10513
02:54:57,120 --> 02:54:57,840
and improvement

10514
02:54:57,840 --> 02:54:58,740
of his dwelling,

10515
02:54:58,740 --> 02:54:59,420
which he cannot

10516
02:54:59,420 --> 02:55:00,120
be excused

10517
02:55:00,120 --> 02:55:00,560
from making

10518
02:55:00,560 --> 02:55:01,200
as comfortable

10519
02:55:01,200 --> 02:55:02,400
as possible.

10520
02:55:02,480 --> 02:55:03,380
And I do not think it

10521
02:55:03,380 --> 02:55:04,580
of light importance

10522
02:55:04,580 --> 02:55:05,780
that he should have

10523
02:55:05,780 --> 02:55:06,960
and conciliatory manners

10524
02:55:06,960 --> 02:55:08,160
towards everybody,

10525
02:55:08,240 --> 02:55:09,240
especially towards

10526
02:55:09,240 --> 02:55:09,980
those to

10527
02:55:09,980 --> 02:55:10,680
whom he owes

10528
02:55:10,680 --> 02:55:11,400
his preferment.

10529
02:55:13,340 --> 02:55:14,120
I cannot acquit

10530
02:55:14,120 --> 02:55:15,320
him of that duty,

10531
02:55:15,480 --> 02:55:16,220
nor could I think

10532
02:55:16,220 --> 02:55:16,940
well of the man

10533
02:55:16,940 --> 02:55:17,600
who should omit

10534
02:55:17,600 --> 02:55:18,120
an occasion

10535
02:55:18,120 --> 02:55:18,860
of testifying

10536
02:55:18,860 --> 02:55:19,400
his respect

10537
02:55:19,400 --> 02:55:19,800
towards

10538
02:55:19,800 --> 02:55:20,780
anybody connected

10539
02:55:20,780 --> 02:55:21,980
with the family.

10540
02:55:23,280 --> 02:55:24,380
And with a bow to Mr.

10541
02:55:24,380 --> 02:55:25,100
Darcy.

10542
02:55:25,100 --> 02:55:26,360
He concluded his speech.

10543
02:55:26,580 --> 02:55:26,960
Which had.

10544
02:55:26,960 --> 02:55:27,560
Been spoken

10545
02:55:27,560 --> 02:55:28,940
so loud as to be heard

10546
02:55:28,940 --> 02:55:30,140
by half the room.

10547
02:55:30,320 --> 02:55:31,400
Many stared.

10548
02:55:31,400 --> 02:55:32,600
Many smiled.

10549
02:55:32,600 --> 02:55:33,500
But no one looked.

10550
02:55:33,500 --> 02:55:34,700
More amused than Mr.

10551
02:55:34,880 --> 02:55:35,640
himself.

10552
02:55:35,640 --> 02:55:36,380
While his wife

10553
02:55:36,380 --> 02:55:36,960
seriously.

10554
02:55:36,960 --> 02:55:37,640
Commended Mr.

10555
02:55:37,640 --> 02:55:38,100
Collins

10556
02:55:38,100 --> 02:55:38,820
for having spoken

10557
02:55:38,820 --> 02:55:40,680
so sensibly and observed

10558
02:55:40,680 --> 02:55:41,100
and a half

10559
02:55:41,100 --> 02:55:42,300
whisper to Lady Lucas

10560
02:55:42,440 --> 02:55:42,860
that he was a

10561
02:55:42,860 --> 02:55:44,360
remarkably clever good

10562
02:55:44,360 --> 02:55:45,560
kind of young man.

10563
02:55:45,920 --> 02:55:46,740
To Elizabeth,

10564
02:55:46,740 --> 02:55:48,140
it appeared that had

10565
02:55:48,140 --> 02:55:48,680
her family

10566
02:55:48,680 --> 02:55:49,580
made an agreement

10567
02:55:49,580 --> 02:55:50,580
to expose themselves

10568
02:55:50,580 --> 02:55:50,960
as much as

10569
02:55:50,960 --> 02:55:51,480
they could

10570
02:55:51,480 --> 02:55:52,620
during the evening.

10571
02:55:52,620 --> 02:55:53,060
It would have

10572
02:55:53,060 --> 02:55:53,780
been impossible.

10573
02:55:53,780 --> 02:55:54,140
For them

10574
02:55:54,140 --> 02:55:55,020
to play their parts

10575
02:55:55,020 --> 02:55:56,040
with more spirit

10576
02:55:56,040 --> 02:55:57,240
or finer success

10577
02:55:57,600 --> 02:55:58,200
and happy.

10578
02:55:58,200 --> 02:55:58,800
Did she think it

10579
02:55:58,800 --> 02:55:59,300
for Bingley

10580
02:55:59,300 --> 02:56:00,180
and her sister

10581
02:56:00,180 --> 02:56:00,600
that some of

10582
02:56:00,600 --> 02:56:01,280
the exhibition

10583
02:56:01,280 --> 02:56:02,480
had escaped his notice

10584
02:56:02,660 --> 02:56:03,660
and that his feelings

10585
02:56:03,660 --> 02:56:04,400
were not of a sort,

10586
02:56:04,400 --> 02:56:05,460
to be much distressed

10587
02:56:05,460 --> 02:56:06,120
by the folly

10588
02:56:06,120 --> 02:56:06,540
which he must

10589
02:56:06,540 --> 02:56:07,860
have witnessed, that

10590
02:56:07,860 --> 02:56:09,060
his two sisters and Mr.

10591
02:56:09,060 --> 02:56:09,840
Darcy, however,

10592
02:56:09,840 --> 02:56:10,440
should have such

10593
02:56:10,440 --> 02:56:11,100
an opportunity

10594
02:56:11,100 --> 02:56:11,780
of ridiculing her.

10595
02:56:11,780 --> 02:56:13,040
Relations was bad.

10596
02:56:13,040 --> 02:56:13,740
Enough

10597
02:56:13,740 --> 02:56:14,520
and she could not.

10598
02:56:14,520 --> 02:56:15,000
Determine

10599
02:56:15,000 --> 02:56:15,320
whether the

10600
02:56:15,320 --> 02:56:16,260
silent contempt

10601
02:56:16,260 --> 02:56:17,160
of the gentleman

10602
02:56:17,160 --> 02:56:17,940
or the insulin

10603
02:56:17,940 --> 02:56:19,140
smiles of the ladies

10604
02:56:19,320 --> 02:56:20,660
were more intolerable.

10605
02:56:21,620 --> 02:56:22,280
The rest of the

10606
02:56:22,280 --> 02:56:22,680
evening

10607
02:56:22,680 --> 02:56:23,880
brought her little.

10608
02:56:24,180 --> 02:56:24,600
She was.

10609
02:56:24,600 --> 02:56:25,520
Teased by Mr.

10610
02:56:25,520 --> 02:56:26,220
Collins.

10611
02:56:26,220 --> 02:56:26,820
Who continued.

10612
02:56:26,820 --> 02:56:27,840
Most perceptively

10613
02:56:27,840 --> 02:56:28,820
by her side.

10614
02:56:28,820 --> 02:56:29,420
And though he could

10615
02:56:29,420 --> 02:56:30,360
not prevail on her

10616
02:56:30,360 --> 02:56:31,560
to dance with him again,

10617
02:56:31,680 --> 02:56:32,660
put it out of her power

10618
02:56:32,660 --> 02:56:33,860
to dance with others

10619
02:56:34,020 --> 02:56:34,640
in vain.

10620
02:56:34,640 --> 02:56:34,940
Did she?

10621
02:56:34,940 --> 02:56:35,360
And treat him

10622
02:56:35,360 --> 02:56:35,880
to stand up

10623
02:56:35,880 --> 02:56:36,900
with somebody else

10624
02:56:36,900 --> 02:56:37,340
and offer

10625
02:56:37,340 --> 02:56:38,040
to introduce him

10626
02:56:38,040 --> 02:56:38,580
to any young

10627
02:56:38,580 --> 02:56:39,780
lady in the room?

10628
02:56:39,800 --> 02:56:40,620
He assured her

10629
02:56:40,620 --> 02:56:41,760
that as to dancing,

10630
02:56:41,760 --> 02:56:42,060
he was

10631
02:56:42,060 --> 02:56:42,960
perfectly indifferent

10632
02:56:42,960 --> 02:56:43,580
to it,

10633
02:56:43,580 --> 02:56:44,820
that his chief object

10634
02:56:44,820 --> 02:56:45,140
was by

10635
02:56:45,140 --> 02:56:46,100
delicate attentions

10636
02:56:46,100 --> 02:56:46,680
to recommend

10637
02:56:46,680 --> 02:56:47,840
himself to her,

10638
02:56:47,840 --> 02:56:48,480
and that he should

10639
02:56:48,480 --> 02:56:49,340
therefore make a point

10640
02:56:49,340 --> 02:56:49,740
of remaining

10641
02:56:49,740 --> 02:56:50,360
close to her

10642
02:56:50,360 --> 02:56:51,560
the whole evening.

10643
02:56:51,680 --> 02:56:52,880
There was no arguing

10644
02:56:53,160 --> 02:56:54,360
such a project.

10645
02:56:54,360 --> 02:56:54,900
She owed her

10646
02:56:54,900 --> 02:56:55,640
greatest relief

10647
02:56:55,640 --> 02:56:56,120
to her friend,

10648
02:56:56,120 --> 02:56:56,960
Miss Lucas.

10649
02:56:56,960 --> 02:56:58,200
Who often joined them

10650
02:56:58,340 --> 02:56:58,800
and good.

10651
02:56:58,800 --> 02:56:59,940
Naturedly engaged Mr.

10652
02:56:59,940 --> 02:57:01,020
Collins conversation

10653
02:57:01,020 --> 02:57:01,640
to herself.

10654
02:57:03,120 --> 02:57:03,540
She was at.

10655
02:57:03,540 --> 02:57:04,340
Least free from

10656
02:57:04,340 --> 02:57:05,120
the offense of Mr.

10657
02:57:05,120 --> 02:57:06,320
Darcy's further notice,

10658
02:57:06,560 --> 02:57:07,640
though often standing

10659
02:57:07,640 --> 02:57:08,420
within a very short

10660
02:57:08,420 --> 02:57:09,300
distance of her

10661
02:57:09,300 --> 02:57:10,500
quite disengaged.

10662
02:57:10,560 --> 02:57:11,220
He never came

10663
02:57:11,220 --> 02:57:12,420
near enough to speak.

10664
02:57:12,600 --> 02:57:13,140
She felt it

10665
02:57:13,140 --> 02:57:13,380
to be

10666
02:57:13,380 --> 02:57:14,460
the probable consequence

10667
02:57:14,460 --> 02:57:15,420
of her allusions to Mr.

10668
02:57:15,420 --> 02:57:16,040
Wickham.

10669
02:57:16,040 --> 02:57:17,240
And rejoiced in it.

10670
02:57:17,660 --> 02:57:18,840
The long born party

10671
02:57:18,840 --> 02:57:19,400
with the last

10672
02:57:19,400 --> 02:57:20,280
of all the company

10673
02:57:20,280 --> 02:57:21,120
to depart,

10674
02:57:21,120 --> 02:57:22,380
and by a maneuver, Mrs.

10675
02:57:22,380 --> 02:57:22,980
Bennett

10676
02:57:22,980 --> 02:57:23,540
had to wait

10677
02:57:23,540 --> 02:57:24,240
for their carriage

10678
02:57:24,240 --> 02:57:25,160
a quarter of an hour

10679
02:57:25,160 --> 02:57:25,820
after everybody

10680
02:57:25,820 --> 02:57:26,840
else was gone,

10681
02:57:26,840 --> 02:57:27,780
which gave them time

10682
02:57:27,780 --> 02:57:28,740
to see how heartily

10683
02:57:28,740 --> 02:57:29,540
they were whisked away

10684
02:57:29,540 --> 02:57:30,740
by some of the family.

10685
02:57:30,960 --> 02:57:31,280
Mrs.

10686
02:57:31,280 --> 02:57:32,220
Hurst and her sister

10687
02:57:32,220 --> 02:57:32,720
scarcely

10688
02:57:32,720 --> 02:57:33,800
opened their mouths

10689
02:57:33,800 --> 02:57:34,280
except to

10690
02:57:34,280 --> 02:57:35,480
complain of fatigue

10691
02:57:35,580 --> 02:57:35,900
and were

10692
02:57:35,900 --> 02:57:36,900
evidently impatient

10693
02:57:36,900 --> 02:57:37,500
to have the house

10694
02:57:37,500 --> 02:57:38,640
to themselves.

10695
02:57:38,640 --> 02:57:39,300
They repulsed

10696
02:57:39,300 --> 02:57:40,320
every attempt of Mrs.

10697
02:57:40,320 --> 02:57:41,520
Bennett's conversation,

10698
02:57:41,700 --> 02:57:42,920
and by doing so, threw

10699
02:57:42,920 --> 02:57:43,460
a languor

10700
02:57:43,460 --> 02:57:44,640
over the whole party,

10701
02:57:44,640 --> 02:57:45,140
which was very

10702
02:57:45,140 --> 02:57:45,800
little relieved

10703
02:57:45,800 --> 02:57:46,740
by the long speeches

10704
02:57:46,740 --> 02:57:47,100
of Mr.

10705
02:57:47,100 --> 02:57:47,640
Collins,

10706
02:57:47,640 --> 02:57:47,940
who was

10707
02:57:47,940 --> 02:57:48,860
complimenting Mr.

10708
02:57:48,860 --> 02:57:49,800
Bingley and his sisters

10709
02:57:49,800 --> 02:57:50,460
on the elegance

10710
02:57:50,460 --> 02:57:51,660
of their entertainment.

10711
02:57:51,680 --> 02:57:51,900
And.

10712
02:57:51,900 --> 02:57:52,760
The hospitality

10713
02:57:52,760 --> 02:57:53,400
and politeness

10714
02:57:53,400 --> 02:57:53,900
which had marked

10715
02:57:53,900 --> 02:57:54,540
their behavior

10716
02:57:54,540 --> 02:57:55,740
to their guests.

10717
02:57:56,000 --> 02:57:56,720
Darcy said

10718
02:57:56,720 --> 02:57:57,680
nothing at all.

10719
02:57:57,680 --> 02:57:58,020
Mr.

10720
02:57:58,020 --> 02:57:58,520
Bennett, in

10721
02:57:58,520 --> 02:57:59,280
equal silence,

10722
02:57:59,280 --> 02:58:00,480
was enjoying the scene.

10723
02:58:00,600 --> 02:58:00,980
Mr.

10724
02:58:00,980 --> 02:58:01,380
Bingley

10725
02:58:01,380 --> 02:58:01,920
and Jane

10726
02:58:01,920 --> 02:58:03,060
were standing together,

10727
02:58:03,060 --> 02:58:03,920
a little detached

10728
02:58:03,920 --> 02:58:04,740
from the rest,

10729
02:58:04,740 --> 02:58:05,280
and talked

10730
02:58:05,280 --> 02:58:06,480
only to each other.

10731
02:58:06,720 --> 02:58:07,760
Elizabeth preserved

10732
02:58:07,760 --> 02:58:08,340
a steady,

10733
02:58:08,340 --> 02:58:08,880
a silence,

10734
02:58:08,880 --> 02:58:09,560
as either Mrs.

10735
02:58:09,560 --> 02:58:10,760
Hirst or Miss Bingley.

10736
02:58:11,040 --> 02:58:11,280
And.

10737
02:58:11,280 --> 02:58:11,900
Even Lydia

10738
02:58:11,900 --> 02:58:12,860
was too much fatigued

10739
02:58:12,860 --> 02:58:13,440
to utter more

10740
02:58:13,440 --> 02:58:13,640
than the

10741
02:58:13,640 --> 02:58:14,840
occasional exclamation.

10742
02:58:14,840 --> 02:58:16,260
Of Lord,

10743
02:58:16,260 --> 02:58:17,780
how tired I am.

10744
02:58:18,140 --> 02:58:19,500
Accompanied by a violent

10745
02:58:19,500 --> 02:58:20,700
yawn,

10746
02:58:20,820 --> 02:58:21,420
when at length

10747
02:58:21,420 --> 02:58:21,960
they arose to

10748
02:58:21,960 --> 02:58:22,760
take leave.

10749
02:58:22,760 --> 02:58:23,120
Mrs.

10750
02:58:23,120 --> 02:58:23,760
Bennett was most

10751
02:58:23,760 --> 02:58:24,620
pressingly civil

10752
02:58:24,620 --> 02:58:25,080
in her hope

10753
02:58:25,080 --> 02:58:25,460
of seeing the

10754
02:58:25,460 --> 02:58:26,120
whole family

10755
02:58:26,120 --> 02:58:27,320
soon at Long Bourn,

10756
02:58:27,360 --> 02:58:28,200
and addressed herself,

10757
02:58:28,200 --> 02:58:29,160
especially to Mr.

10758
02:58:29,160 --> 02:58:30,000
Bingley. To.

10759
02:58:30,000 --> 02:58:31,020
Assure him how happy

10760
02:58:31,020 --> 02:58:31,640
he would make them

10761
02:58:31,640 --> 02:58:32,060
by eating

10762
02:58:32,060 --> 02:58:32,760
a family dinner

10763
02:58:32,760 --> 02:58:33,960
with them at any time

10764
02:58:34,020 --> 02:58:35,040
without the ceremony

10765
02:58:35,040 --> 02:58:36,240
of a formal invitation.

10766
02:58:36,620 --> 02:58:37,440
Bingley was all

10767
02:58:37,440 --> 02:58:38,540
grateful pleasure,

10768
02:58:38,540 --> 02:58:39,660
and he readily engaged

10769
02:58:39,660 --> 02:58:40,100
for taking

10770
02:58:40,100 --> 02:58:41,240
the earliest opportunity

10771
02:58:41,240 --> 02:58:42,200
of waiting on her

10772
02:58:42,200 --> 02:58:43,020
after his return

10773
02:58:43,020 --> 02:58:43,880
from London.

10774
02:58:43,880 --> 02:58:44,780
Whether he was obliged

10775
02:58:44,780 --> 02:58:45,060
to go

10776
02:58:45,060 --> 02:58:46,320
the next day for a short

10777
02:58:46,340 --> 02:58:47,960
time, Mrs.

10778
02:58:47,960 --> 02:58:48,380
Bennett was

10779
02:58:48,380 --> 02:58:49,580
perfectly satisfied

10780
02:58:49,640 --> 02:58:50,160
and quitted

10781
02:58:50,160 --> 02:58:50,540
the house,

10782
02:58:50,540 --> 02:58:50,840
under the

10783
02:58:50,840 --> 02:58:52,080
delightful persuasion

10784
02:58:52,080 --> 02:58:53,280
that allowing

10785
02:58:53,280 --> 02:58:54,020
for the necessary

10786
02:58:54,020 --> 02:58:54,600
preparation

10787
02:58:54,600 --> 02:58:55,440
of settlements,

10788
02:58:55,440 --> 02:58:56,280
new carriages

10789
02:58:56,280 --> 02:58:57,380
and wedding clothes.

10790
02:58:57,380 --> 02:58:58,460
She should undoubtedly.

10791
02:58:58,460 --> 02:58:59,140
See her daughter

10792
02:58:59,140 --> 02:59:00,020
settled at Netherfield

10793
02:59:00,020 --> 02:59:00,740
in the course of three

10794
02:59:00,740 --> 02:59:01,880
or four months

10795
02:59:01,880 --> 02:59:02,300
of having

10796
02:59:02,300 --> 02:59:02,960
another daughter

10797
02:59:02,960 --> 02:59:03,600
married to Mr..

10798
02:59:03,600 --> 02:59:04,280
Collins.

10799
02:59:04,280 --> 02:59:04,760
She thought

10800
02:59:04,760 --> 02:59:05,960
with equal certainty

10801
02:59:06,000 --> 02:59:07,080
and with considerable,

10802
02:59:07,080 --> 02:59:07,260
though

10803
02:59:07,260 --> 02:59:08,460
not equal pleasure.

10804
02:59:08,900 --> 02:59:09,660
Elizabeth was

10805
02:59:09,660 --> 02:59:10,640
the least dear to her

10806
02:59:10,640 --> 02:59:11,840
of all her children.

10807
02:59:11,840 --> 02:59:12,180
And though

10808
02:59:12,180 --> 02:59:13,340
the match and the man

10809
02:59:13,340 --> 02:59:13,860
were quite good

10810
02:59:13,860 --> 02:59:14,880
enough for her,

10811
02:59:14,880 --> 02:59:15,900
the worth of each

10812
02:59:15,900 --> 02:59:16,920
was eclipsed by Mr.

10813
02:59:16,920 --> 02:59:18,440
Bingley and Netherfield.

10814
02:59:20,520 --> 02:59:21,720
Chapter 19.

10815
02:59:23,060 --> 02:59:24,360
The next day opened.

10816
02:59:24,360 --> 02:59:24,600
A new.

10817
02:59:24,600 --> 02:59:26,420
Scene and long born Mr.

10818
02:59:26,420 --> 02:59:27,020
Collins

10819
02:59:27,020 --> 02:59:28,260
made his declaration

10820
02:59:28,260 --> 02:59:29,420
in form

10821
02:59:29,420 --> 02:59:30,800
having resolved to do it

10822
02:59:30,800 --> 02:59:32,000
without loss of time,

10823
02:59:32,340 --> 02:59:33,720
as his leave of absence

10824
02:59:33,720 --> 02:59:34,460
extended only

10825
02:59:34,460 --> 02:59:34,640
to the

10826
02:59:34,640 --> 02:59:35,840
following Saturday

10827
02:59:35,960 --> 02:59:37,100
and having no feelings

10828
02:59:37,100 --> 02:59:37,760
of diffidence

10829
02:59:37,760 --> 02:59:38,220
to make it

10830
02:59:38,220 --> 02:59:39,480
distressing himself

10831
02:59:39,480 --> 02:59:40,680
even at the moment,

10832
02:59:40,740 --> 02:59:41,720
he set about it

10833
02:59:41,720 --> 02:59:43,160
in a very orderly manner

10834
02:59:43,340 --> 02:59:44,640
with all the observances

10835
02:59:44,640 --> 02:59:45,500
which he supposed

10836
02:59:45,500 --> 02:59:46,220
a regular part

10837
02:59:46,220 --> 02:59:47,420
of the business.

10838
02:59:47,420 --> 02:59:48,360
On finding Mrs.

10839
02:59:48,360 --> 02:59:49,340
Bennett, Elizabeth

10840
02:59:49,340 --> 02:59:50,160
and one of the younger

10841
02:59:50,160 --> 02:59:50,960
girls together.

10842
02:59:50,960 --> 02:59:52,160
Soon after breakfast,

10843
02:59:52,320 --> 02:59:53,360
he addressed the mother

10844
02:59:53,360 --> 02:59:54,560
in these words.

10845
02:59:54,840 --> 02:59:56,120
May I hope, madame,

10846
02:59:56,820 --> 02:59:57,500
for your interest

10847
02:59:57,500 --> 02:59:58,040
with your fair

10848
02:59:58,040 --> 02:59:59,240
daughter, Elizabeth

10849
03:00:00,060 --> 03:00:00,780
when I solicit

10850
03:00:00,780 --> 03:00:01,280
for the honor

10851
03:00:01,280 --> 03:00:02,340
of a private audience

10852
03:00:02,340 --> 03:00:03,180
with her in the course

10853
03:00:03,180 --> 03:00:03,780
of this morning.

10854
03:00:05,640 --> 03:00:06,560
Before Elizabeth

10855
03:00:06,560 --> 03:00:06,980
had time

10856
03:00:06,980 --> 03:00:07,500
for anything

10857
03:00:07,500 --> 03:00:08,180
but a blush of

10858
03:00:08,180 --> 03:00:09,440
surprise Mrs.

10859
03:00:09,440 --> 03:00:09,800
Bennett

10860
03:00:09,800 --> 03:00:11,000
answered instantly.

10861
03:00:11,180 --> 03:00:12,180
Oh, dear.

10862
03:00:12,180 --> 03:00:13,760
Yes, certainly.

10863
03:00:13,820 --> 03:00:14,580
I am sure

10864
03:00:14,580 --> 03:00:15,240
Lizzie would be

10865
03:00:15,240 --> 03:00:16,440
very happy.

10866
03:00:16,500 --> 03:00:17,640
I am sure she can have

10867
03:00:17,640 --> 03:00:18,840
no objection.

10868
03:00:18,960 --> 03:00:19,680
Come, Kitty.

10869
03:00:19,680 --> 03:00:20,280
I want you.

10870
03:00:20,280 --> 03:00:21,480
Upstairs.

10871
03:00:21,600 --> 03:00:22,680
And gathering her work

10872
03:00:22,680 --> 03:00:23,300
together.

10873
03:00:23,300 --> 03:00:24,560
She was hastening away

10874
03:00:24,560 --> 03:00:25,160
when Elizabeth

10875
03:00:25,160 --> 03:00:26,360
called out.

10876
03:00:26,360 --> 03:00:28,100
Dear madam, do not go.

10877
03:00:28,260 --> 03:00:29,540
I Beg you will not go.

10878
03:00:29,840 --> 03:00:30,240
Mr.

10879
03:00:30,240 --> 03:00:31,800
Collins must excuse me.

10880
03:00:31,940 --> 03:00:32,420
He can have

10881
03:00:32,420 --> 03:00:33,380
nothing to say to me

10882
03:00:33,380 --> 03:00:34,260
that anybody need

10883
03:00:34,260 --> 03:00:35,180
not hear.

10884
03:00:35,180 --> 03:00:36,680
I am going away myself.

10885
03:00:37,160 --> 03:00:39,260
No, no, Lizzie.

10886
03:00:39,260 --> 03:00:40,280
I desire you to stay

10887
03:00:40,280 --> 03:00:41,420
where you are.

10888
03:00:41,420 --> 03:00:41,900
And upon

10889
03:00:41,900 --> 03:00:42,320
Elizabeth,

10890
03:00:42,320 --> 03:00:43,160
seeming really

10891
03:00:43,160 --> 03:00:43,760
with vexed

10892
03:00:43,760 --> 03:00:44,460
and embarrassed

10893
03:00:44,460 --> 03:00:45,680
looks about to escape.

10894
03:00:45,980 --> 03:00:47,540
She added, Lizzie,

10895
03:00:47,780 --> 03:00:48,920
I insist

10896
03:00:48,920 --> 03:00:49,920
upon your staying

10897
03:00:49,920 --> 03:00:51,080
and hearing Mr.

10898
03:00:51,080 --> 03:00:52,280
Collins.

10899
03:00:52,640 --> 03:00:53,340
Elizabeth would

10900
03:00:53,340 --> 03:00:54,140
not oppose

10901
03:00:54,140 --> 03:00:55,340
such an injunction

10902
03:00:55,340 --> 03:00:56,040
and a moment's

10903
03:00:56,040 --> 03:00:56,720
consideration,

10904
03:00:56,720 --> 03:00:57,240
making her

10905
03:00:57,240 --> 03:00:58,240
also sensible.

10906
03:00:58,240 --> 03:00:59,000
It would be wisest

10907
03:00:59,000 --> 03:01:00,200
to get it over as soon

10908
03:01:00,200 --> 03:01:00,480
and as

10909
03:01:00,480 --> 03:01:01,680
quietly as possible.

10910
03:01:01,980 --> 03:01:03,140
She sat down again

10911
03:01:03,140 --> 03:01:04,340
and tried to conceal

10912
03:01:04,520 --> 03:01:05,840
by incessant employment

10913
03:01:06,120 --> 03:01:06,800
the feelings

10914
03:01:06,800 --> 03:01:07,620
which were divided

10915
03:01:07,620 --> 03:01:08,660
between distress

10916
03:01:08,660 --> 03:01:09,860
and diversion.

10917
03:01:10,320 --> 03:01:10,680
Mrs.

10918
03:01:10,680 --> 03:01:11,000
Bennett

10919
03:01:11,000 --> 03:01:11,880
and Kitty walked.

10920
03:01:11,880 --> 03:01:12,840
Off, and as soon.

10921
03:01:12,840 --> 03:01:14,160
As they were gone, Mr.

10922
03:01:14,160 --> 03:01:15,360
Collins began.

10923
03:01:16,220 --> 03:01:17,180
Believe me,

10924
03:01:17,180 --> 03:01:18,540
my dear Miss Elizabeth,

10925
03:01:18,840 --> 03:01:19,820
that your modesty

10926
03:01:19,820 --> 03:01:20,900
so far from doing

10927
03:01:20,900 --> 03:01:22,100
you any disservice

10928
03:01:22,160 --> 03:01:23,100
rather adds to your

10929
03:01:23,100 --> 03:01:24,300
other perfections.

10930
03:01:24,660 --> 03:01:25,560
You would have been less

10931
03:01:25,560 --> 03:01:26,780
amiable in my eyes

10932
03:01:26,780 --> 03:01:27,080
had there

10933
03:01:27,080 --> 03:01:27,780
not been this

10934
03:01:27,780 --> 03:01:28,980
little unwillingness.

10935
03:01:29,700 --> 03:01:30,300
But allow me

10936
03:01:30,300 --> 03:01:31,160
to assure you

10937
03:01:31,160 --> 03:01:31,680
that I have

10938
03:01:31,680 --> 03:01:32,640
your respected mother's

10939
03:01:32,640 --> 03:01:33,240
permission for

10940
03:01:33,240 --> 03:01:33,920
this address.

10941
03:01:35,880 --> 03:01:36,860
You can hardly doubt the

10942
03:01:36,860 --> 03:01:38,060
purport of my discourse.

10943
03:01:38,060 --> 03:01:38,540
However, your

10944
03:01:38,540 --> 03:01:39,480
natural delicacy

10945
03:01:39,480 --> 03:01:39,860
may lead

10946
03:01:39,860 --> 03:01:41,060
you to dissemble.

10947
03:01:42,360 --> 03:01:43,280
My attentions have been

10948
03:01:43,280 --> 03:01:44,700
to Mark, to be mistaken.

10949
03:01:46,740 --> 03:01:47,180
Almost

10950
03:01:47,180 --> 03:01:48,000
As soon as I entered

10951
03:01:48,000 --> 03:01:48,420
the house,

10952
03:01:48,420 --> 03:01:49,220
I singled you out

10953
03:01:49,220 --> 03:01:49,940
as the companion

10954
03:01:49,940 --> 03:01:51,140
of my future life.

10955
03:01:52,940 --> 03:01:54,060
But before I am run away

10956
03:01:54,060 --> 03:01:54,900
with by my feelings

10957
03:01:54,900 --> 03:01:56,100
on this subject,

10958
03:01:57,320 --> 03:01:57,860
perhaps it will

10959
03:01:57,860 --> 03:01:58,560
be advisable

10960
03:01:58,560 --> 03:01:58,820
for me

10961
03:01:58,820 --> 03:01:59,940
to state my reasons

10962
03:01:59,940 --> 03:02:01,140
for marrying

10963
03:02:01,880 --> 03:02:02,180
and.

10964
03:02:02,180 --> 03:02:03,060
Moreover,

10965
03:02:03,060 --> 03:02:03,540
for coming

10966
03:02:03,540 --> 03:02:04,460
into Hertfordshire

10967
03:02:04,460 --> 03:02:05,120
with the design

10968
03:02:05,120 --> 03:02:06,320
of selecting a wife,

10969
03:02:06,720 --> 03:02:07,920
as I certainly did.

10970
03:02:08,660 --> 03:02:09,860
The idea of Mr.

10971
03:02:09,860 --> 03:02:10,440
Collins,

10972
03:02:10,440 --> 03:02:10,980
with all his

10973
03:02:10,980 --> 03:02:12,180
solemn composure

10974
03:02:12,260 --> 03:02:13,400
being run away with

10975
03:02:13,400 --> 03:02:14,600
by his feelings,

10976
03:02:14,600 --> 03:02:15,900
made Elizabeth so near

10977
03:02:15,900 --> 03:02:16,580
laughing

10978
03:02:16,580 --> 03:02:17,600
that she could not use

10979
03:02:17,600 --> 03:02:18,420
the short pause

10980
03:02:18,420 --> 03:02:19,160
he allowed in

10981
03:02:19,160 --> 03:02:19,860
any attempt

10982
03:02:19,860 --> 03:02:21,060
to stop him further.

10983
03:02:21,180 --> 03:02:22,380
And he continued.

10984
03:02:22,920 --> 03:02:23,480
My reasons

10985
03:02:23,480 --> 03:02:24,800
for marrying are first

10986
03:02:24,900 --> 03:02:25,440
that I think it

10987
03:02:25,440 --> 03:02:25,920
a right thing

10988
03:02:25,920 --> 03:02:26,900
for every clergyman.

10989
03:02:26,900 --> 03:02:28,280
In easy circumstances

10990
03:02:28,280 --> 03:02:29,060
like myself

10991
03:02:30,980 --> 03:02:31,400
to set the

10992
03:02:31,400 --> 03:02:32,480
example of matrimony

10993
03:02:32,480 --> 03:02:33,680
in his parish.

10994
03:02:34,080 --> 03:02:35,180
Secondly,

10995
03:02:35,180 --> 03:02:36,020
that I am convinced

10996
03:02:36,020 --> 03:02:37,200
it will add very greatly

10997
03:02:37,200 --> 03:02:38,400
to my happiness.

10998
03:02:38,960 --> 03:02:39,960
And thirdly,

10999
03:02:39,960 --> 03:02:40,620
which perhaps

11000
03:02:40,620 --> 03:02:40,880
I ought

11001
03:02:40,880 --> 03:02:41,160
to have

11002
03:02:41,160 --> 03:02:42,180
mentioned earlier,

11003
03:02:42,180 --> 03:02:42,620
that it is

11004
03:02:42,620 --> 03:02:43,700
the particular advice

11005
03:02:43,700 --> 03:02:44,520
and recommendation

11006
03:02:44,520 --> 03:02:45,800
of the very noble lady,

11007
03:02:46,320 --> 03:02:47,220
whom I have the honor

11008
03:02:47,220 --> 03:02:48,420
of calling Patroness

11009
03:02:49,160 --> 03:02:49,640
twice

11010
03:02:49,640 --> 03:02:50,520
as she condescended

11011
03:02:50,520 --> 03:02:51,720
give me her opinion

11012
03:02:51,840 --> 03:02:52,740
unasked to

11013
03:02:52,740 --> 03:02:53,940
on this subject.

11014
03:02:54,740 --> 03:02:55,200
And it was.

11015
03:02:55,200 --> 03:02:55,680
But the very

11016
03:02:55,680 --> 03:02:56,420
Saturday night

11017
03:02:56,420 --> 03:02:57,620
before I left Hansford

11018
03:02:58,140 --> 03:02:59,100
between our pools

11019
03:02:59,100 --> 03:03:00,740
at Quadrille, while Mrs.

11020
03:03:00,740 --> 03:03:01,260
Jenkinson

11021
03:03:01,260 --> 03:03:01,980
was arranging Mr.

11022
03:03:01,980 --> 03:03:03,120
Borg's footstool

11023
03:03:03,120 --> 03:03:04,320
that she said.

11024
03:03:04,460 --> 03:03:04,740
Mr.

11025
03:03:04,740 --> 03:03:05,100
Collins,

11026
03:03:05,100 --> 03:03:06,000
you must marry

11027
03:03:06,000 --> 03:03:06,740
a clergyman,

11028
03:03:06,740 --> 03:03:07,980
like you must marry,

11029
03:03:08,000 --> 03:03:09,420
choose properly, choose

11030
03:03:09,420 --> 03:03:10,160
a gentlewoman

11031
03:03:10,160 --> 03:03:10,940
for my sake

11032
03:03:10,940 --> 03:03:12,080
and for your own.

11033
03:03:12,080 --> 03:03:13,100
Let her be an active,

11034
03:03:13,100 --> 03:03:13,560
useful.

11035
03:03:13,560 --> 03:03:14,520
Sort of person, not.

11036
03:03:14,520 --> 03:03:15,720
Brought up high,

11037
03:03:15,900 --> 03:03:17,120
but able to make a small

11038
03:03:17,120 --> 03:03:18,360
income go a good way.

11039
03:03:19,620 --> 03:03:20,820
This my advice.

11040
03:03:21,380 --> 03:03:22,280
Find such a

11041
03:03:22,280 --> 03:03:23,660
woman as soon as you can

11042
03:03:23,820 --> 03:03:24,980
bring her to Hansford

11043
03:03:24,980 --> 03:03:26,180
and I will visit her.

11044
03:03:27,440 --> 03:03:28,500
Allow me, by the way,

11045
03:03:28,500 --> 03:03:30,020
to observe my cousin

11046
03:03:30,020 --> 03:03:31,160
that I do not reckon

11047
03:03:31,160 --> 03:03:31,680
the notice

11048
03:03:31,680 --> 03:03:32,180
and kindness

11049
03:03:32,180 --> 03:03:32,540
of Lady

11050
03:03:32,540 --> 03:03:33,500
Catherine de Borg

11051
03:03:33,500 --> 03:03:33,960
as among

11052
03:03:33,960 --> 03:03:34,380
the least

11053
03:03:34,380 --> 03:03:35,160
of the advantages

11054
03:03:35,160 --> 03:03:36,360
in my power to offer.

11055
03:03:36,980 --> 03:03:37,680
You will find her

11056
03:03:37,680 --> 03:03:38,760
manners beyond anything

11057
03:03:38,760 --> 03:03:39,960
I can.

11058
03:03:40,080 --> 03:03:40,700
And your wit

11059
03:03:40,700 --> 03:03:42,060
and vivacity, I think

11060
03:03:42,300 --> 03:03:42,660
must be

11061
03:03:42,660 --> 03:03:43,820
acceptable to her,

11062
03:03:43,820 --> 03:03:45,000
especially when tempered

11063
03:03:45,000 --> 03:03:45,800
with the silence

11064
03:03:45,800 --> 03:03:46,340
and respect

11065
03:03:46,340 --> 03:03:47,060
which her rank will

11066
03:03:47,060 --> 03:03:48,260
inevitably excite.

11067
03:03:49,680 --> 03:03:50,220
Thus much

11068
03:03:50,220 --> 03:03:51,300
for my general intention

11069
03:03:51,300 --> 03:03:51,740
in the favor

11070
03:03:51,740 --> 03:03:52,940
of matrimony,

11071
03:03:53,160 --> 03:03:54,180
it remains to be told

11072
03:03:54,180 --> 03:03:54,840
why my views

11073
03:03:54,840 --> 03:03:55,340
were directed

11074
03:03:55,340 --> 03:03:56,220
to long borne

11075
03:03:56,220 --> 03:03:56,760
instead of my

11076
03:03:56,760 --> 03:03:57,960
own neighborhood,

11077
03:03:58,020 --> 03:03:58,700
where I assure you

11078
03:03:58,700 --> 03:04:00,120
there are many amiable

11079
03:04:00,120 --> 03:04:01,320
young women.

11080
03:04:01,340 --> 03:04:02,120
But the fact is

11081
03:04:02,120 --> 03:04:03,300
that being as I am

11082
03:04:03,300 --> 03:04:04,340
to inherit this estate

11083
03:04:04,340 --> 03:04:04,980
after the death

11084
03:04:04,980 --> 03:04:06,180
of your own it father,

11085
03:04:06,320 --> 03:04:07,160
who, however, may

11086
03:04:07,160 --> 03:04:08,360
live many years,

11087
03:04:08,880 --> 03:04:09,320
I could not

11088
03:04:09,320 --> 03:04:10,280
satisfy myself

11089
03:04:10,280 --> 03:04:11,040
without resolving

11090
03:04:11,040 --> 03:04:11,840
to choose a wife

11091
03:04:11,840 --> 03:04:13,040
from among his daughters

11092
03:04:13,200 --> 03:04:14,280
that the loss to them

11093
03:04:14,280 --> 03:04:14,720
might be

11094
03:04:14,720 --> 03:04:15,920
as little as possible

11095
03:04:16,160 --> 03:04:16,500
when the

11096
03:04:16,500 --> 03:04:17,360
melancholy event

11097
03:04:17,360 --> 03:04:18,560
takes place,

11098
03:04:18,600 --> 03:04:19,340
which, however,

11099
03:04:19,340 --> 03:04:20,580
as I have already said,

11100
03:04:20,580 --> 03:04:21,240
may not be for

11101
03:04:21,240 --> 03:04:22,440
several years.

11102
03:04:22,980 --> 03:04:24,080
This has been my motive,

11103
03:04:24,080 --> 03:04:25,280
my fair cousin

11104
03:04:25,280 --> 03:04:26,400
and I flatter myself.

11105
03:04:26,400 --> 03:04:27,000
It will not

11106
03:04:27,000 --> 03:04:27,840
sink me in your.

11107
03:04:29,180 --> 03:04:29,700
And now

11108
03:04:29,700 --> 03:04:30,900
nothing remains for me

11109
03:04:30,900 --> 03:04:31,760
but to assure you

11110
03:04:31,760 --> 03:04:32,220
in the most

11111
03:04:32,220 --> 03:04:33,260
animated language

11112
03:04:33,260 --> 03:04:34,080
of the violence,

11113
03:04:34,080 --> 03:04:35,280
of my affection

11114
03:04:35,720 --> 03:04:36,420
to fortune,

11115
03:04:36,420 --> 03:04:37,200
I am perfectly

11116
03:04:37,200 --> 03:04:38,360
indifferent

11117
03:04:38,360 --> 03:04:39,420
and shall make no demand

11118
03:04:39,420 --> 03:04:40,020
of that nature

11119
03:04:40,020 --> 03:04:41,220
on your father,

11120
03:04:41,220 --> 03:04:42,320
since I am well aware

11121
03:04:42,320 --> 03:04:42,900
that it could not

11122
03:04:42,900 --> 03:04:44,100
be complied with,

11123
03:04:44,120 --> 03:04:45,420
and that ?1,000

11124
03:04:45,420 --> 03:04:46,620
in the four percents

11125
03:04:46,680 --> 03:04:47,580
which will not be yours

11126
03:04:47,580 --> 03:04:48,060
till after

11127
03:04:48,060 --> 03:04:48,480
your mother's

11128
03:04:48,480 --> 03:04:49,800
decease, is all that

11129
03:04:49,800 --> 03:04:50,100
you may

11130
03:04:50,100 --> 03:04:51,300
ever be entitled to

11131
03:04:52,500 --> 03:04:53,100
on that head.

11132
03:04:53,100 --> 03:04:53,580
Therefore,

11133
03:04:53,580 --> 03:04:54,080
I shall

11134
03:04:54,080 --> 03:04:55,380
be uniformly silent

11135
03:04:56,520 --> 03:04:56,940
and you may

11136
03:04:56,940 --> 03:04:57,740
assure yourself

11137
03:04:57,740 --> 03:04:58,160
that no

11138
03:04:58,160 --> 03:04:59,180
ungenerous reproach

11139
03:04:59,180 --> 03:05:00,500
shall ever pass my lips

11140
03:05:00,500 --> 03:05:01,700
when we are married.

11141
03:05:02,280 --> 03:05:02,660
It was.

11142
03:05:02,660 --> 03:05:04,100
Absolutely necessary

11143
03:05:04,100 --> 03:05:04,860
to interrupt him.

11144
03:05:04,860 --> 03:05:06,020
Now.

11145
03:05:06,020 --> 03:05:07,680
You are too hasty.

11146
03:05:08,480 --> 03:05:09,660
She cried.

11147
03:05:09,660 --> 03:05:10,500
You forget that

11148
03:05:10,500 --> 03:05:11,700
I have made no answer.

11149
03:05:12,320 --> 03:05:13,140
Let me do it

11150
03:05:13,140 --> 03:05:13,820
without further

11151
03:05:13,820 --> 03:05:15,020
loss of time.

11152
03:05:15,020 --> 03:05:15,660
Except my

11153
03:05:15,660 --> 03:05:16,340
thanks for

11154
03:05:16,340 --> 03:05:17,040
the compliment

11155
03:05:17,040 --> 03:05:18,120
you were paying me.

11156
03:05:18,120 --> 03:05:19,160
I am very sensible

11157
03:05:19,160 --> 03:05:19,580
of the honor

11158
03:05:19,580 --> 03:05:20,520
of your proposals,

11159
03:05:20,520 --> 03:05:21,560
but it is impossible

11160
03:05:21,560 --> 03:05:22,020
for me to do

11161
03:05:22,020 --> 03:05:22,700
otherwise than

11162
03:05:22,700 --> 03:05:23,640
to decline them.

11163
03:05:24,680 --> 03:05:25,380
I am not

11164
03:05:25,380 --> 03:05:26,580
now to learn.

11165
03:05:26,660 --> 03:05:27,780
Replied Collins,

11166
03:05:27,780 --> 03:05:27,960
with a

11167
03:05:27,960 --> 03:05:29,160
formal wave of the hand.

11168
03:05:30,440 --> 03:05:31,460
That it is usual

11169
03:05:31,460 --> 03:05:32,240
with young ladies

11170
03:05:32,240 --> 03:05:32,720
to reject

11171
03:05:32,720 --> 03:05:33,660
the addresses of the man

11172
03:05:33,660 --> 03:05:34,760
whom they secretly mean

11173
03:05:34,760 --> 03:05:35,960
to accept

11174
03:05:36,720 --> 03:05:37,800
when he first applies

11175
03:05:37,800 --> 03:05:39,000
for their favor,

11176
03:05:39,080 --> 03:05:40,200
and that sometimes

11177
03:05:40,200 --> 03:05:41,420
the refusal is repeated

11178
03:05:41,420 --> 03:05:42,000
a second

11179
03:05:42,000 --> 03:05:43,220
or even a third time.

11180
03:05:43,580 --> 03:05:44,460
I am therefore

11181
03:05:44,460 --> 03:05:45,680
by no means discouraged

11182
03:05:45,680 --> 03:05:46,100
by what you

11183
03:05:46,100 --> 03:05:47,300
have just said

11184
03:05:47,400 --> 03:05:48,060
and shall hope

11185
03:05:48,060 --> 03:05:49,260
to lead you to the altar

11186
03:05:49,460 --> 03:05:50,660
ere long.

11187
03:05:51,080 --> 03:05:52,640
Upon my words.

11188
03:05:53,360 --> 03:05:54,560
Cried Elizabeth.

11189
03:05:54,660 --> 03:05:55,700
Your hope is rather

11190
03:05:55,700 --> 03:05:56,660
an extraordinary one

11191
03:05:56,660 --> 03:05:57,860
after my declaration.

11192
03:05:58,380 --> 03:05:59,580
I do assure you that

11193
03:05:59,580 --> 03:06:00,120
I am not

11194
03:06:00,120 --> 03:06:00,560
one of those

11195
03:06:00,560 --> 03:06:01,560
young ladies.

11196
03:06:01,560 --> 03:06:02,660
If such young ladies

11197
03:06:02,660 --> 03:06:03,380
there are

11198
03:06:03,380 --> 03:06:04,340
who are so daring

11199
03:06:04,340 --> 03:06:04,860
as to risk

11200
03:06:04,860 --> 03:06:05,540
their happiness

11201
03:06:05,540 --> 03:06:06,060
on the chance

11202
03:06:06,060 --> 03:06:06,660
of being asked

11203
03:06:06,660 --> 03:06:07,860
a second time,

11204
03:06:07,940 --> 03:06:09,360
I am perfectly serious

11205
03:06:09,360 --> 03:06:10,560
in my refusal.

11206
03:06:10,680 --> 03:06:11,840
You could not make me

11207
03:06:11,840 --> 03:06:12,540
happy.

11208
03:06:12,540 --> 03:06:13,400
And I am convinced

11209
03:06:13,400 --> 03:06:13,760
that I am

11210
03:06:13,760 --> 03:06:14,480
the last woman

11211
03:06:14,480 --> 03:06:14,960
in the world

11212
03:06:14,960 --> 03:06:16,160
who could make you so

11213
03:06:16,560 --> 03:06:17,700
nay were your friend.

11214
03:06:17,700 --> 03:06:18,680
Lady Catherine, to know.

11215
03:06:18,680 --> 03:06:19,100
Me.

11216
03:06:19,100 --> 03:06:19,940
I am persuaded

11217
03:06:19,940 --> 03:06:20,640
she would find me

11218
03:06:20,640 --> 03:06:21,600
in every respect,

11219
03:06:21,600 --> 03:06:22,520
ill qualified

11220
03:06:22,520 --> 03:06:23,720
for the situation.

11221
03:06:24,000 --> 03:06:24,300
Where it's

11222
03:06:24,300 --> 03:06:24,620
certain

11223
03:06:24,620 --> 03:06:25,340
that Lady Catherine

11224
03:06:25,340 --> 03:06:26,300
would think.

11225
03:06:26,300 --> 03:06:26,820
Said Mr.

11226
03:06:26,820 --> 03:06:28,020
Collins, very gravely.

11227
03:06:28,580 --> 03:06:29,520
But I cannot imagine

11228
03:06:29,520 --> 03:06:30,240
that Her Ladyship

11229
03:06:30,240 --> 03:06:30,720
would at all

11230
03:06:30,720 --> 03:06:31,520
disapprove of you.

11231
03:06:32,600 --> 03:06:33,200
And you may be

11232
03:06:33,200 --> 03:06:33,740
certain that

11233
03:06:33,740 --> 03:06:34,400
when I have the honor

11234
03:06:34,400 --> 03:06:35,600
of seeing her again,

11235
03:06:35,600 --> 03:06:36,140
I shall speak

11236
03:06:36,140 --> 03:06:36,980
in the highest terms

11237
03:06:36,980 --> 03:06:38,280
of your modesty economy

11238
03:06:38,280 --> 03:06:38,640
and other

11239
03:06:38,640 --> 03:06:40,020
amiable qualifications.

11240
03:06:42,000 --> 03:06:42,800
Indeed, Mr.

11241
03:06:42,800 --> 03:06:43,260
Collins,

11242
03:06:43,260 --> 03:06:44,120
All praise of me

11243
03:06:44,120 --> 03:06:45,320
will be unnecessary.

11244
03:06:45,680 --> 03:06:46,800
You must give me leave

11245
03:06:46,800 --> 03:06:48,120
to judge for myself

11246
03:06:48,440 --> 03:06:49,140
and pay me

11247
03:06:49,140 --> 03:06:49,800
the compliment.

11248
03:06:49,800 --> 03:06:51,140
Believing what I say.

11249
03:06:51,860 --> 03:06:53,160
I wish you very happy

11250
03:06:53,160 --> 03:06:54,360
and very rich.

11251
03:06:54,380 --> 03:06:55,340
And by refusing

11252
03:06:55,340 --> 03:06:55,860
your hands

11253
03:06:55,860 --> 03:06:57,020
do all in my power

11254
03:06:57,020 --> 03:06:57,500
to prevent

11255
03:06:57,500 --> 03:06:58,700
your being otherwise,

11256
03:06:59,100 --> 03:06:59,720
and making.

11257
03:06:59,720 --> 03:07:00,360
Me the offer

11258
03:07:00,360 --> 03:07:01,520
you must have satisfied

11259
03:07:01,520 --> 03:07:02,000
delicacy

11260
03:07:02,000 --> 03:07:02,600
of your feelings

11261
03:07:02,600 --> 03:07:03,120
with regard to.

11262
03:07:03,120 --> 03:07:04,080
My family

11263
03:07:04,080 --> 03:07:05,120
and may take possession

11264
03:07:05,120 --> 03:07:05,720
of nothing born.

11265
03:07:05,720 --> 03:07:06,440
To state with ever.

11266
03:07:06,440 --> 03:07:06,920
It falls

11267
03:07:06,920 --> 03:07:07,500
without any

11268
03:07:07,500 --> 03:07:08,700
self reproach.

11269
03:07:08,960 --> 03:07:09,600
This matter

11270
03:07:09,600 --> 03:07:10,340
may be considered

11271
03:07:10,340 --> 03:07:11,660
therefore as finally

11272
03:07:11,700 --> 03:07:12,900
settled.

11273
03:07:13,100 --> 03:07:14,280
And rising as she thus.

11274
03:07:14,280 --> 03:07:15,000
Spoke.

11275
03:07:15,000 --> 03:07:15,780
She would have quitted

11276
03:07:15,780 --> 03:07:16,920
the room had Mr..

11277
03:07:16,920 --> 03:07:17,780
Collins not

11278
03:07:17,780 --> 03:07:18,860
thus addressed her.

11279
03:07:20,240 --> 03:07:20,720
When I do

11280
03:07:20,720 --> 03:07:21,440
myself the honor

11281
03:07:21,440 --> 03:07:22,140
of speaking to you

11282
03:07:22,140 --> 03:07:23,340
next on the subject,

11283
03:07:24,120 --> 03:07:24,720
I shall hope

11284
03:07:24,720 --> 03:07:25,160
to receive

11285
03:07:25,160 --> 03:07:26,420
a more favorable answer

11286
03:07:26,420 --> 03:07:26,840
than you have

11287
03:07:26,840 --> 03:07:28,040
now given me.

11288
03:07:28,440 --> 03:07:29,120
Though

11289
03:07:29,120 --> 03:07:30,180
I am far from accusing

11290
03:07:30,180 --> 03:07:31,380
you of the cruelty at

11291
03:07:31,940 --> 03:07:32,580
because I know it

11292
03:07:32,580 --> 03:07:32,840
to be

11293
03:07:32,840 --> 03:07:33,800
the established custom

11294
03:07:33,800 --> 03:07:34,700
of your sex

11295
03:07:34,700 --> 03:07:35,540
to reject a man

11296
03:07:35,540 --> 03:07:35,720
on the

11297
03:07:35,720 --> 03:07:36,920
first application.

11298
03:07:36,980 --> 03:07:38,540
And perhaps

11299
03:07:38,540 --> 03:07:39,380
you have even now

11300
03:07:39,380 --> 03:07:39,960
said as much

11301
03:07:39,960 --> 03:07:40,440
to encourage

11302
03:07:40,440 --> 03:07:41,640
my suit

11303
03:07:41,900 --> 03:07:42,840
as would be consistent

11304
03:07:42,840 --> 03:07:43,860
with the true delicacy

11305
03:07:43,860 --> 03:07:45,060
of the female character.

11306
03:07:46,920 --> 03:07:47,780
Really, Mr.

11307
03:07:47,780 --> 03:07:48,600
Collins?

11308
03:07:48,600 --> 03:07:49,380
Cried Elizabeth

11309
03:07:49,380 --> 03:07:50,520
with some warmth.

11310
03:07:50,520 --> 03:07:51,080
You puzzle

11311
03:07:51,080 --> 03:07:52,280
me exceedingly.

11312
03:07:52,500 --> 03:07:53,340
If what I pay,

11313
03:07:53,340 --> 03:07:53,940
the two said

11314
03:07:53,940 --> 03:07:54,660
can appear to you

11315
03:07:54,660 --> 03:07:55,080
in the form

11316
03:07:55,080 --> 03:07:56,240
of encouragement.

11317
03:07:56,240 --> 03:07:56,900
I know not

11318
03:07:56,900 --> 03:07:57,620
how to express.

11319
03:07:57,620 --> 03:07:58,580
My refusal in such.

11320
03:07:58,580 --> 03:07:59,360
A way as to convince

11321
03:07:59,360 --> 03:08:00,560
you of its being one.

11322
03:08:01,940 --> 03:08:02,720
You must give me

11323
03:08:02,720 --> 03:08:03,960
leave to flatter myself.

11324
03:08:03,980 --> 03:08:05,040
My dear cousin,

11325
03:08:05,040 --> 03:08:05,940
that your refusal,

11326
03:08:05,940 --> 03:08:06,560
my addresses

11327
03:08:06,560 --> 03:08:07,380
are merely words,

11328
03:08:07,380 --> 03:08:08,520
Of course.

11329
03:08:08,520 --> 03:08:09,180
My reasons

11330
03:08:09,180 --> 03:08:09,780
for believing

11331
03:08:09,780 --> 03:08:10,980
it are briefly these.

11332
03:08:11,780 --> 03:08:12,980
It does not appear to me

11333
03:08:12,980 --> 03:08:13,680
that my hand

11334
03:08:13,680 --> 03:08:14,520
is unworthy.

11335
03:08:14,520 --> 03:08:15,720
Your acceptance,

11336
03:08:15,840 --> 03:08:16,160
or that

11337
03:08:16,160 --> 03:08:17,040
the establishment

11338
03:08:17,040 --> 03:08:17,760
I can offer

11339
03:08:17,760 --> 03:08:18,960
would be any other

11340
03:08:19,100 --> 03:08:20,300
than highly desirable.

11341
03:08:20,720 --> 03:08:21,940
My situation in life,

11342
03:08:21,960 --> 03:08:22,620
my connections

11343
03:08:22,620 --> 03:08:23,240
with the family

11344
03:08:23,240 --> 03:08:24,260
of the book,

11345
03:08:24,260 --> 03:08:25,220
and my relationship,

11346
03:08:25,220 --> 03:08:25,680
your own

11347
03:08:25,680 --> 03:08:26,580
are circumstances

11348
03:08:26,580 --> 03:08:27,780
highly in my favor,

11349
03:08:28,280 --> 03:08:29,040
and you should take it

11350
03:08:29,040 --> 03:08:29,520
into further

11351
03:08:29,520 --> 03:08:30,720
consideration that

11352
03:08:31,040 --> 03:08:31,620
in spite

11353
03:08:31,620 --> 03:08:31,860
of your

11354
03:08:31,860 --> 03:08:33,060
manifold attractions,

11355
03:08:33,240 --> 03:08:33,680
it is by

11356
03:08:33,680 --> 03:08:34,560
no means certain

11357
03:08:34,560 --> 03:08:35,300
that another

11358
03:08:35,300 --> 03:08:36,240
of marriage may ever

11359
03:08:36,240 --> 03:08:37,440
be made you.

11360
03:08:37,820 --> 03:08:38,420
Your portion

11361
03:08:38,420 --> 03:08:39,780
is unhappily so small

11362
03:08:40,100 --> 03:08:40,520
that it will

11363
03:08:40,520 --> 03:08:41,820
in all likelihood undo

11364
03:08:41,820 --> 03:08:42,260
the effects

11365
03:08:42,260 --> 03:08:43,220
of your loveliness and

11366
03:08:43,220 --> 03:08:44,660
amiable qualifications.

11367
03:08:46,340 --> 03:08:46,920
As I must

11368
03:08:46,920 --> 03:08:47,900
therefore conclude

11369
03:08:47,900 --> 03:08:48,960
that you are not serious

11370
03:08:48,960 --> 03:08:50,160
in your rejection of me.

11371
03:08:50,460 --> 03:08:51,080
I shall choose

11372
03:08:51,080 --> 03:08:51,740
to attribute it

11373
03:08:51,740 --> 03:08:52,260
to your wish

11374
03:08:52,260 --> 03:08:52,860
of increasing

11375
03:08:52,860 --> 03:08:54,140
my love by suspense,

11376
03:08:54,440 --> 03:08:55,040
according to the

11377
03:08:55,040 --> 03:08:55,740
usual practice

11378
03:08:55,740 --> 03:08:56,940
of elegant females.

11379
03:08:57,620 --> 03:08:59,060
I do assure you

11380
03:08:59,660 --> 03:09:00,020
that I have

11381
03:09:00,020 --> 03:09:00,960
no pretensions.

11382
03:09:00,960 --> 03:09:01,500
Whatsoever

11383
03:09:01,500 --> 03:09:02,280
to that kind of.

11384
03:09:02,280 --> 03:09:03,480
Elegance which consists

11385
03:09:03,480 --> 03:09:04,400
in tormenting

11386
03:09:04,400 --> 03:09:05,600
a respectable man.

11387
03:09:06,060 --> 03:09:06,920
I would rather be paid

11388
03:09:06,920 --> 03:09:07,620
the compliment

11389
03:09:07,620 --> 03:09:08,400
of being believed

11390
03:09:08,400 --> 03:09:09,600
sincere.

11391
03:09:10,160 --> 03:09:10,700
I thank you

11392
03:09:10,700 --> 03:09:11,720
again and again

11393
03:09:11,720 --> 03:09:12,240
for the honor

11394
03:09:12,240 --> 03:09:12,680
you have done me

11395
03:09:12,680 --> 03:09:13,880
in your proposals.

11396
03:09:13,940 --> 03:09:15,020
But To accept them

11397
03:09:15,020 --> 03:09:16,160
is absolutely

11398
03:09:16,160 --> 03:09:17,280
impossible.

11399
03:09:17,280 --> 03:09:17,940
My feelings

11400
03:09:17,940 --> 03:09:19,100
in every respect

11401
03:09:19,100 --> 03:09:20,300
forbid it.

11402
03:09:20,760 --> 03:09:22,140
Can I speak plainer?

11403
03:09:22,580 --> 03:09:23,640
Do not consider.

11404
03:09:23,640 --> 03:09:24,080
Me now

11405
03:09:24,080 --> 03:09:24,800
as an elegant

11406
03:09:24,800 --> 03:09:25,820
female intending.

11407
03:09:25,820 --> 03:09:26,760
To plague you,

11408
03:09:26,760 --> 03:09:27,860
but as a rational

11409
03:09:27,860 --> 03:09:29,280
creature, speaking the

11410
03:09:29,280 --> 03:09:30,860
truth from her heart.

11411
03:09:32,280 --> 03:09:33,660
Your uniformly charming.

11412
03:09:34,080 --> 03:09:34,700
Cried hair

11413
03:09:34,700 --> 03:09:35,600
with an air of awkward

11414
03:09:35,600 --> 03:09:36,800
gallantry.

11415
03:09:37,160 --> 03:09:38,060
And I am persuaded

11416
03:09:38,060 --> 03:09:39,060
that when sanctioned

11417
03:09:39,060 --> 03:09:39,720
by the express

11418
03:09:39,720 --> 03:09:40,160
authority

11419
03:09:40,160 --> 03:09:41,040
of both your excellent

11420
03:09:41,040 --> 03:09:42,240
parents,

11421
03:09:42,240 --> 03:09:42,960
my proposals

11422
03:09:42,960 --> 03:09:43,500
will not fail

11423
03:09:43,500 --> 03:09:44,700
of being acceptable.

11424
03:09:46,100 --> 03:09:46,680
To such.

11425
03:09:46,680 --> 03:09:47,460
Poor severance

11426
03:09:47,460 --> 03:09:48,020
and willful

11427
03:09:48,020 --> 03:09:48,920
self-deception.

11428
03:09:48,920 --> 03:09:49,500
Elizabeth would

11429
03:09:49,500 --> 03:09:50,700
make no reply.

11430
03:09:50,840 --> 03:09:51,660
And immediately.

11431
03:09:51,660 --> 03:09:52,520
And in silence,

11432
03:09:52,520 --> 03:09:53,460
withdrew.

11433
03:09:53,460 --> 03:09:54,200
Determined.

11434
03:09:54,200 --> 03:09:54,960
If he persisted

11435
03:09:54,960 --> 03:09:55,580
in considering

11436
03:09:55,580 --> 03:09:56,580
her repeated refusals

11437
03:09:56,580 --> 03:09:57,140
as flattering

11438
03:09:57,140 --> 03:09:58,040
encouragement

11439
03:09:58,040 --> 03:09:59,420
to apply to her father,

11440
03:09:59,660 --> 03:10:00,720
whose negative mind

11441
03:10:00,720 --> 03:10:01,440
might be uttered

11442
03:10:01,440 --> 03:10:02,160
in such a manner

11443
03:10:02,160 --> 03:10:03,200
as to be decisive

11444
03:10:03,200 --> 03:10:04,160
and whose behavior

11445
03:10:04,160 --> 03:10:04,700
at least.

11446
03:10:04,700 --> 03:10:05,720
Could not be mistaken.

11447
03:10:05,720 --> 03:10:06,840
For the affectation

11448
03:10:06,840 --> 03:10:07,680
and Cocodrie

11449
03:10:07,680 --> 03:10:09,180
of an elegant female.

11450
03:10:11,940 --> 03:10:13,140
Chapter 20.

11451
03:10:13,700 --> 03:10:14,040
Mr.

11452
03:10:14,040 --> 03:10:14,660
Collins was

11453
03:10:14,660 --> 03:10:15,540
not left long

11454
03:10:15,540 --> 03:10:15,740
to the

11455
03:10:15,740 --> 03:10:16,880
silent contemplation

11456
03:10:16,880 --> 03:10:18,080
of his successful love

11457
03:10:18,240 --> 03:10:18,740
for Mrs.

11458
03:10:18,740 --> 03:10:19,860
Bennett having dawdled

11459
03:10:19,860 --> 03:10:20,960
about in the vestibule.

11460
03:10:20,960 --> 03:10:21,260
Watch

11461
03:10:21,260 --> 03:10:21,800
for the end of

11462
03:10:21,800 --> 03:10:22,760
the conference.

11463
03:10:22,760 --> 03:10:24,000
No sooner saw Elizabeth

11464
03:10:24,000 --> 03:10:24,600
open the door

11465
03:10:24,600 --> 03:10:25,140
and with quick

11466
03:10:25,140 --> 03:10:25,920
step, pass

11467
03:10:25,920 --> 03:10:26,360
her toward

11468
03:10:26,360 --> 03:10:27,380
the staircase.

11469
03:10:27,380 --> 03:10:28,080
Then she entered

11470
03:10:28,080 --> 03:10:29,060
the breakfast room.

11471
03:10:29,060 --> 03:10:29,300
And.

11472
03:10:29,300 --> 03:10:30,540
Congratulated both him

11473
03:10:30,540 --> 03:10:31,260
and herself

11474
03:10:31,260 --> 03:10:32,180
in warm terms

11475
03:10:32,180 --> 03:10:33,320
on the happy prospect

11476
03:10:33,320 --> 03:10:33,560
of their

11477
03:10:33,560 --> 03:10:34,760
near connection.

11478
03:10:34,920 --> 03:10:35,280
Mr.

11479
03:10:35,280 --> 03:10:36,300
Collins received

11480
03:10:36,300 --> 03:10:36,860
and returned

11481
03:10:36,860 --> 03:10:37,760
these felicitations

11482
03:10:37,760 --> 03:10:38,960
with equal pleasure.

11483
03:10:38,960 --> 03:10:39,380
And then.

11484
03:10:39,380 --> 03:10:40,200
Proceeded to relate

11485
03:10:40,200 --> 03:10:40,940
the particulars

11486
03:10:40,940 --> 03:10:42,000
of their interview

11487
03:10:42,000 --> 03:10:42,680
with the result

11488
03:10:42,680 --> 03:10:43,580
of which he trusted.

11489
03:10:43,580 --> 03:10:44,360
He had every reason

11490
03:10:44,360 --> 03:10:45,360
to be satisfied

11491
03:10:45,360 --> 03:10:46,500
since the refusal which

11492
03:10:46,500 --> 03:10:46,940
his cousin

11493
03:10:46,940 --> 03:10:47,760
had steadfastly

11494
03:10:47,760 --> 03:10:48,260
given him

11495
03:10:48,260 --> 03:10:49,380
would naturally flow

11496
03:10:49,380 --> 03:10:50,580
from her bashful

11497
03:10:50,900 --> 03:10:52,220
and the genuine delicacy

11498
03:10:52,220 --> 03:10:53,420
of her character.

11499
03:10:53,780 --> 03:10:54,720
This information,

11500
03:10:54,720 --> 03:10:55,940
however, startled Mrs.

11501
03:10:55,940 --> 03:10:56,600
Bennett.

11502
03:10:56,600 --> 03:10:57,600
She would have been glad

11503
03:10:57,600 --> 03:10:58,820
to be equally satisfied

11504
03:10:58,820 --> 03:10:59,420
that her daughter

11505
03:10:59,420 --> 03:11:00,380
had meant to

11506
03:11:00,380 --> 03:11:01,220
him by protesting

11507
03:11:01,220 --> 03:11:02,420
against his proposals.

11508
03:11:02,640 --> 03:11:03,420
But she dared

11509
03:11:03,420 --> 03:11:04,020
not believe.

11510
03:11:04,020 --> 03:11:05,360
It and could not help

11511
03:11:05,360 --> 03:11:06,560
saying so,

11512
03:11:06,920 --> 03:11:08,460
but to depend upon it.

11513
03:11:08,480 --> 03:11:08,720
Mr.

11514
03:11:08,720 --> 03:11:09,920
Collins, she

11515
03:11:10,160 --> 03:11:11,180
that Lizzie shall

11516
03:11:11,180 --> 03:11:12,380
be brought to reason.

11517
03:11:12,480 --> 03:11:13,140
I will speak

11518
03:11:13,140 --> 03:11:13,740
to her about it

11519
03:11:13,740 --> 03:11:14,700
directly.

11520
03:11:14,700 --> 03:11:15,740
She is a very

11521
03:11:15,740 --> 03:11:17,220
headstrong, foolish girl

11522
03:11:17,360 --> 03:11:17,700
and does

11523
03:11:17,700 --> 03:11:18,300
not know

11524
03:11:18,300 --> 03:11:19,020
her own interest.

11525
03:11:19,020 --> 03:11:20,660
But I make her know it.

11526
03:11:21,620 --> 03:11:22,340
Pardon me for

11527
03:11:22,340 --> 03:11:23,540
interrupting you, madam.

11528
03:11:23,600 --> 03:11:24,180
Cried Mr.

11529
03:11:24,180 --> 03:11:25,100
Collins.

11530
03:11:25,100 --> 03:11:25,680
But if she is

11531
03:11:25,680 --> 03:11:26,360
really headstrong

11532
03:11:26,360 --> 03:11:27,920
and foolish, I know

11533
03:11:27,920 --> 03:11:28,400
not whether

11534
03:11:28,400 --> 03:11:28,680
she would

11535
03:11:28,680 --> 03:11:29,480
altogether be

11536
03:11:29,480 --> 03:11:30,680
a very desirable wife

11537
03:11:30,680 --> 03:11:32,000
to a man in my situation

11538
03:11:32,460 --> 03:11:33,360
who naturally looks

11539
03:11:33,360 --> 03:11:33,900
for happiness

11540
03:11:33,900 --> 03:11:35,100
in the marriage state.

11541
03:11:35,600 --> 03:11:36,120
If therefore,

11542
03:11:36,120 --> 03:11:37,340
she actually persists in

11543
03:11:37,340 --> 03:11:38,540
rejecting my suit,

11544
03:11:38,640 --> 03:11:39,360
perhaps were better

11545
03:11:39,360 --> 03:11:40,040
not to force her

11546
03:11:40,040 --> 03:11:40,980
into accepting me,

11547
03:11:40,980 --> 03:11:41,960
because if liable

11548
03:11:41,960 --> 03:11:42,780
to such defects

11549
03:11:42,780 --> 03:11:43,980
of temper,

11550
03:11:44,360 --> 03:11:45,320
she could not contribute

11551
03:11:45,320 --> 03:11:46,520
much to my felicity.

11552
03:11:48,360 --> 03:11:49,080
Sir, you quite

11553
03:11:49,080 --> 03:11:50,280
misunderstand me.

11554
03:11:50,520 --> 03:11:51,060
Said Mrs.

11555
03:11:51,060 --> 03:11:52,260
Bennett, alarmed.

11556
03:11:52,320 --> 03:11:52,940
Lizzie is

11557
03:11:52,940 --> 03:11:53,820
only headstrong

11558
03:11:53,820 --> 03:11:54,560
in such matters

11559
03:11:54,560 --> 03:11:55,340
as these.

11560
03:11:55,340 --> 03:11:56,220
In everything else,

11561
03:11:56,220 --> 03:11:57,440
she is as good natured

11562
03:11:57,440 --> 03:11:58,640
a girl ever lived.

11563
03:11:58,700 --> 03:11:59,640
I will go directly

11564
03:11:59,640 --> 03:11:59,960
to Mr.

11565
03:11:59,960 --> 03:12:00,440
Bennett,

11566
03:12:00,440 --> 03:12:01,580
and we shall very soon

11567
03:12:01,580 --> 03:12:02,300
settle it with her.

11568
03:12:02,300 --> 03:12:04,040
I am sure she would.

11569
03:12:04,040 --> 03:12:04,820
Not give him time

11570
03:12:04,820 --> 03:12:06,260
to reply, but hurrying

11571
03:12:06,260 --> 03:12:07,460
instantly to her husband

11572
03:12:07,640 --> 03:12:08,300
called out

11573
03:12:08,300 --> 03:12:08,820
as she entered

11574
03:12:08,820 --> 03:12:10,020
the library.

11575
03:12:10,020 --> 03:12:10,440
Oh, Mr.

11576
03:12:10,440 --> 03:12:10,920
Bennett,

11577
03:12:10,920 --> 03:12:11,300
you are

11578
03:12:11,300 --> 03:12:12,560
wanted immediately.

11579
03:12:12,680 --> 03:12:14,180
We are all in an uproar.

11580
03:12:14,460 --> 03:12:15,420
You must come

11581
03:12:15,420 --> 03:12:16,440
and make Lizzie Mr.

11582
03:12:16,440 --> 03:12:17,640
Collins, for she

11583
03:12:17,640 --> 03:12:18,720
she will not have him.

11584
03:12:18,720 --> 03:12:19,820
And if you do not make

11585
03:12:19,820 --> 03:12:20,160
haste,

11586
03:12:20,160 --> 03:12:21,020
he will change his mind

11587
03:12:21,020 --> 03:12:22,220
and not have her.

11588
03:12:22,500 --> 03:12:22,820
Mr.

11589
03:12:22,820 --> 03:12:24,120
Bennett raised his eyes

11590
03:12:24,120 --> 03:12:24,680
from his book

11591
03:12:24,680 --> 03:12:26,100
as she entered and fixed

11592
03:12:26,100 --> 03:12:26,520
them on her

11593
03:12:26,520 --> 03:12:27,500
face with a calm

11594
03:12:28,500 --> 03:12:29,160
which was not in the

11595
03:12:29,160 --> 03:12:30,020
least altered

11596
03:12:30,020 --> 03:12:31,220
by her communication.

11597
03:12:31,560 --> 03:12:32,300
I have not

11598
03:12:32,300 --> 03:12:32,960
the pleasure

11599
03:12:32,960 --> 03:12:34,020
of understanding.

11600
03:12:34,020 --> 03:12:34,920
You, said he.

11601
03:12:34,920 --> 03:12:35,360
When she had

11602
03:12:35,360 --> 03:12:36,320
finished her speech.

11603
03:12:36,320 --> 03:12:37,520
Of What are you talking.

11604
03:12:38,040 --> 03:12:38,760
Of? Mr.

11605
03:12:38,760 --> 03:12:40,080
Collins and Lizzie?

11606
03:12:40,280 --> 03:12:41,000
Lizzie declares

11607
03:12:41,000 --> 03:12:41,340
that she will

11608
03:12:41,340 --> 03:12:42,420
not have Mr. Collins.

11609
03:12:42,420 --> 03:12:42,840
And Mr.

11610
03:12:42,840 --> 03:12:43,820
Collins begins to say

11611
03:12:43,820 --> 03:12:44,120
that he would

11612
03:12:44,120 --> 03:12:45,240
not have Lizzie.

11613
03:12:45,240 --> 03:12:46,200
And what am I to do

11614
03:12:46,200 --> 03:12:47,400
on the occasion?

11615
03:12:47,400 --> 03:12:47,880
It seems a

11616
03:12:47,880 --> 03:12:49,080
hopeless business.

11617
03:12:49,340 --> 03:12:50,900
Speak to Lizzie about it

11618
03:12:50,900 --> 03:12:51,680
yourself.

11619
03:12:51,680 --> 03:12:53,120
Tell her that you insist

11620
03:12:53,120 --> 03:12:54,320
upon her marrying him.

11621
03:12:54,780 --> 03:12:56,040
Let her be called down.

11622
03:12:56,040 --> 03:12:56,640
She shall hear

11623
03:12:56,640 --> 03:12:57,840
my opinion.

11624
03:12:58,560 --> 03:12:58,940
Mrs.

11625
03:12:58,940 --> 03:12:59,520
Bennett rang

11626
03:12:59,520 --> 03:13:00,080
the bell

11627
03:13:00,080 --> 03:13:00,980
and Miss Elizabeth

11628
03:13:00,980 --> 03:13:01,560
was summoned

11629
03:13:01,560 --> 03:13:02,760
to the library.

11630
03:13:03,060 --> 03:13:04,260
Come here, child.

11631
03:13:04,320 --> 03:13:05,060
Cried her father

11632
03:13:05,060 --> 03:13:06,260
as she appeared.

11633
03:13:06,840 --> 03:13:08,100
I have sent you on

11634
03:13:08,100 --> 03:13:09,480
an affair of importance.

11635
03:13:10,800 --> 03:13:11,780
I understand that Mr.

11636
03:13:11,780 --> 03:13:12,720
Collins has made

11637
03:13:12,720 --> 03:13:13,160
you an offer

11638
03:13:13,160 --> 03:13:14,160
of marriage.

11639
03:13:14,160 --> 03:13:14,900
Is it true?

11640
03:13:15,860 --> 03:13:16,340
Elizabeth

11641
03:13:16,340 --> 03:13:17,540
replied that it was

11642
03:13:17,900 --> 03:13:19,100
Very well.

11643
03:13:19,100 --> 03:13:20,240
And this offer

11644
03:13:20,240 --> 03:13:20,780
of marriage.

11645
03:13:20,780 --> 03:13:21,900
You have refused.

11646
03:13:21,900 --> 03:13:23,100
I have, sir.

11647
03:13:23,580 --> 03:13:24,440
Very well.

11648
03:13:24,440 --> 03:13:25,040
We now come

11649
03:13:25,040 --> 03:13:26,240
to the point.

11650
03:13:26,660 --> 03:13:27,140
Your mother

11651
03:13:27,140 --> 03:13:27,920
insists upon

11652
03:13:27,920 --> 03:13:29,120
your accepting it.

11653
03:13:29,120 --> 03:13:29,940
Is it not, sir?

11654
03:13:29,940 --> 03:13:31,140
Mrs. Bennett?

11655
03:13:31,280 --> 03:13:32,060
Yes.

11656
03:13:32,060 --> 03:13:32,460
Or I will

11657
03:13:32,460 --> 03:13:33,660
never see her again.

11658
03:13:33,860 --> 03:13:35,300
An unhappy alternative

11659
03:13:35,300 --> 03:13:35,820
is before

11660
03:13:35,820 --> 03:13:36,620
you, Elizabeth.

11661
03:13:36,620 --> 03:13:37,400
From This day

11662
03:13:37,400 --> 03:13:38,640
you must be a stranger

11663
03:13:38,660 --> 03:13:39,920
to one of your parents.

11664
03:13:40,040 --> 03:13:40,460
Your mother

11665
03:13:40,460 --> 03:13:41,660
will never see you again

11666
03:13:41,780 --> 03:13:43,200
if you do not marry Mr.

11667
03:13:43,200 --> 03:13:44,100
Collins.

11668
03:13:44,100 --> 03:13:45,120
And I will never see

11669
03:13:45,120 --> 03:13:45,800
you again.

11670
03:13:45,800 --> 03:13:46,860
If you do.

11671
03:13:46,860 --> 03:13:47,820
Elizabeth could not

11672
03:13:47,820 --> 03:13:48,420
but smile

11673
03:13:48,420 --> 03:13:49,320
at such a conclusion

11674
03:13:49,320 --> 03:13:50,420
of such a beginning.

11675
03:13:50,420 --> 03:13:50,960
But Mrs..

11676
03:13:50,960 --> 03:13:51,380
Bennett,

11677
03:13:51,380 --> 03:13:51,680
who had

11678
03:13:51,680 --> 03:13:52,520
persuaded herself

11679
03:13:52,520 --> 03:13:52,740
that her

11680
03:13:52,740 --> 03:13:53,540
husband regarded

11681
03:13:53,540 --> 03:13:53,960
the affair

11682
03:13:53,960 --> 03:13:54,840
as she wished.

11683
03:13:54,840 --> 03:13:55,740
Was excessively

11684
03:13:55,740 --> 03:13:56,940
disappointed.

11685
03:13:57,260 --> 03:13:58,320
What do you mean?

11686
03:13:58,320 --> 03:13:58,580
Mr.

11687
03:13:58,580 --> 03:13:59,520
Bennett, in talking

11688
03:13:59,520 --> 03:14:00,380
this way.

11689
03:14:00,380 --> 03:14:01,280
You promised me

11690
03:14:01,280 --> 03:14:02,360
to insist upon her

11691
03:14:02,360 --> 03:14:03,560
marrying him.

11692
03:14:03,740 --> 03:14:04,740
My dear.

11693
03:14:04,740 --> 03:14:05,840
Replied her husband.

11694
03:14:05,840 --> 03:14:07,380
I two small favors

11695
03:14:07,380 --> 03:14:08,160
to request.

11696
03:14:08,160 --> 03:14:08,600
First,

11697
03:14:08,600 --> 03:14:09,360
that you will allow me

11698
03:14:09,360 --> 03:14:10,040
the free use

11699
03:14:10,040 --> 03:14:11,100
of my understanding

11700
03:14:11,100 --> 03:14:12,380
on the present occasion,

11701
03:14:12,380 --> 03:14:14,000
and secondly of my room.

11702
03:14:14,040 --> 03:14:14,460
I shall be

11703
03:14:14,460 --> 03:14:15,200
glad to have the

11704
03:14:15,200 --> 03:14:16,400
library to myself

11705
03:14:16,400 --> 03:14:17,600
as soon as may be.

11706
03:14:17,780 --> 03:14:18,440
Not yet.

11707
03:14:18,440 --> 03:14:18,860
However,

11708
03:14:18,860 --> 03:14:19,320
in spite

11709
03:14:19,320 --> 03:14:20,160
of her disappointment

11710
03:14:20,160 --> 03:14:21,020
in her husband.

11711
03:14:21,020 --> 03:14:21,480
Did Mrs.

11712
03:14:21,480 --> 03:14:21,840
Bennett

11713
03:14:21,840 --> 03:14:23,040
give up the point?

11714
03:14:23,060 --> 03:14:24,320
She talks to Elizabeth

11715
03:14:24,320 --> 03:14:25,520
again and again,

11716
03:14:25,680 --> 03:14:26,280
coaxed

11717
03:14:26,280 --> 03:14:27,120
and threatened her

11718
03:14:27,120 --> 03:14:28,100
by turns.

11719
03:14:28,100 --> 03:14:29,280
She endeavored to secure

11720
03:14:29,280 --> 03:14:30,480
Jane in her interest.

11721
03:14:30,720 --> 03:14:31,340
But Jane,

11722
03:14:31,340 --> 03:14:32,160
with all possible

11723
03:14:32,160 --> 03:14:32,900
mildness,

11724
03:14:32,900 --> 03:14:34,280
declined interfering.

11725
03:14:34,560 --> 03:14:35,460
And Elizabeth,

11726
03:14:35,460 --> 03:14:36,260
sometimes with

11727
03:14:36,260 --> 03:14:37,080
real earnestness

11728
03:14:37,080 --> 03:14:37,700
and sometimes

11729
03:14:37,700 --> 03:14:38,900
with playful gaiety,

11730
03:14:39,000 --> 03:14:40,460
replied to her attacks,

11731
03:14:40,880 --> 03:14:41,600
though her manner

11732
03:14:41,600 --> 03:14:42,800
varied, however, her

11733
03:14:42,800 --> 03:14:44,640
determination never did.

11734
03:14:45,600 --> 03:14:45,920
Mr.

11735
03:14:45,920 --> 03:14:47,160
Collins, meanwhile, was

11736
03:14:47,160 --> 03:14:48,500
meditating in solitude

11737
03:14:48,500 --> 03:14:49,620
on what had passed.

11738
03:14:49,620 --> 03:14:50,280
He thought too

11739
03:14:50,280 --> 03:14:51,000
well of himself

11740
03:14:51,000 --> 03:14:51,680
to comprehend.

11741
03:14:51,680 --> 03:14:52,620
On what motives

11742
03:14:52,620 --> 03:14:53,100
his cousin

11743
03:14:53,100 --> 03:14:54,240
could refuse him.

11744
03:14:54,240 --> 03:14:54,680
And though

11745
03:14:54,680 --> 03:14:55,820
his pride was hurt.

11746
03:14:55,820 --> 03:14:56,600
He suffered in

11747
03:14:56,600 --> 03:14:57,800
no other way.

11748
03:14:57,840 --> 03:14:58,680
His regard for her

11749
03:14:58,680 --> 03:14:59,880
was quite imaginary,

11750
03:15:00,020 --> 03:15:00,960
and the possibility

11751
03:15:00,960 --> 03:15:01,140
of her

11752
03:15:01,140 --> 03:15:01,680
deserving her

11753
03:15:01,680 --> 03:15:02,480
mother's reproach

11754
03:15:02,480 --> 03:15:03,440
prevented his feeling.

11755
03:15:03,440 --> 03:15:04,620
Any regret.

11756
03:15:04,620 --> 03:15:05,460
While the family

11757
03:15:05,460 --> 03:15:06,660
were in this confusion,

11758
03:15:06,660 --> 03:15:07,740
Charlotte Lucas came

11759
03:15:07,740 --> 03:15:08,340
to spend the day

11760
03:15:08,340 --> 03:15:09,080
with them.

11761
03:15:09,080 --> 03:15:09,720
She was met

11762
03:15:09,720 --> 03:15:10,400
in the vestibule

11763
03:15:10,400 --> 03:15:11,220
by Lydia,

11764
03:15:11,220 --> 03:15:12,200
who flying to her,

11765
03:15:12,200 --> 03:15:13,400
cried in a half whisper.

11766
03:15:13,820 --> 03:15:15,360
I glad you will come,

11767
03:15:15,500 --> 03:15:16,260
for there is such

11768
03:15:16,260 --> 03:15:17,180
fun here.

11769
03:15:17,180 --> 03:15:18,120
What do you think

11770
03:15:18,120 --> 03:15:18,660
has happened

11771
03:15:18,660 --> 03:15:19,560
this morning?

11772
03:15:19,560 --> 03:15:20,120
Mr.

11773
03:15:20,120 --> 03:15:20,640
Collins

11774
03:15:20,640 --> 03:15:21,260
has made an offer

11775
03:15:21,260 --> 03:15:21,740
to Lizzie

11776
03:15:21,740 --> 03:15:22,980
and she will not

11777
03:15:22,980 --> 03:15:24,180
have him.

11778
03:15:24,440 --> 03:15:25,280
Charlotte hardly

11779
03:15:25,280 --> 03:15:26,240
had time to answer

11780
03:15:26,240 --> 03:15:27,080
before they were joined

11781
03:15:27,080 --> 03:15:27,980
by Kitty,

11782
03:15:27,980 --> 03:15:28,560
who came to

11783
03:15:28,560 --> 03:15:29,760
tell the same news.

11784
03:15:29,900 --> 03:15:30,740
And no sooner had

11785
03:15:30,740 --> 03:15:31,100
they entered

11786
03:15:31,100 --> 03:15:32,060
the breakfast room

11787
03:15:32,060 --> 03:15:32,580
where Mrs.

11788
03:15:32,580 --> 03:15:33,660
Bennett was alone.

11789
03:15:33,660 --> 03:15:34,560
Then she likewise

11790
03:15:34,560 --> 03:15:35,760
began on the subject,

11791
03:15:35,820 --> 03:15:37,020
calling on Miss Lucas

11792
03:15:37,020 --> 03:15:38,120
for her compassion

11793
03:15:38,120 --> 03:15:38,940
and entreating her

11794
03:15:38,940 --> 03:15:39,480
to persuade

11795
03:15:39,480 --> 03:15:39,900
her friend

11796
03:15:39,900 --> 03:15:40,800
Lizzie to comply

11797
03:15:40,800 --> 03:15:41,700
with the wishes of all

11798
03:15:41,700 --> 03:15:42,900
her family.

11799
03:15:42,980 --> 03:15:43,500
Prayed.

11800
03:15:43,500 --> 03:15:44,420
Do my damnedest,

11801
03:15:44,420 --> 03:15:45,440
Lucas, she.

11802
03:15:45,440 --> 03:15:46,440
Added in a melancholy.

11803
03:15:46,440 --> 03:15:47,120
Tone.

11804
03:15:47,120 --> 03:15:48,060
But nobody is on

11805
03:15:48,060 --> 03:15:48,960
my side.

11806
03:15:48,960 --> 03:15:50,040
Nobody takes part

11807
03:15:50,040 --> 03:15:50,660
with me.

11808
03:15:50,660 --> 03:15:52,320
I am cruelly used.

11809
03:15:52,460 --> 03:15:53,900
Nobody feels for my poor

11810
03:15:53,900 --> 03:15:55,100
nerves.

11811
03:15:55,260 --> 03:15:56,160
Charlotte's reply

11812
03:15:56,160 --> 03:15:56,840
was spared

11813
03:15:56,840 --> 03:15:58,040
by the entrance of Jane

11814
03:15:58,040 --> 03:15:59,880
and Elizabeth I.

11815
03:16:00,120 --> 03:16:01,500
There she comes.

11816
03:16:01,740 --> 03:16:02,460
Continue, Mrs.

11817
03:16:02,460 --> 03:16:03,120
Bennett.

11818
03:16:03,120 --> 03:16:04,900
Looking as unconcerned

11819
03:16:04,900 --> 03:16:06,240
it may be, and caring

11820
03:16:06,240 --> 03:16:07,200
no more for us than

11821
03:16:07,200 --> 03:16:07,580
if we were

11822
03:16:07,580 --> 03:16:08,780
at York, provided

11823
03:16:08,780 --> 03:16:10,080
she can have her own way.

11824
03:16:10,680 --> 03:16:11,540
But I tell

11825
03:16:11,540 --> 03:16:12,740
you, Miss Lizzie,

11826
03:16:12,800 --> 03:16:13,560
if you take it

11827
03:16:13,560 --> 03:16:14,640
into your head to go on

11828
03:16:14,640 --> 03:16:15,080
refusing

11829
03:16:15,080 --> 03:16:16,160
every offer of marriage

11830
03:16:16,160 --> 03:16:16,760
in this way,

11831
03:16:16,760 --> 03:16:17,360
you will never

11832
03:16:17,360 --> 03:16:18,560
get a husband at all.

11833
03:16:18,680 --> 03:16:19,260
And I am sure

11834
03:16:19,260 --> 03:16:19,920
I do not know

11835
03:16:19,920 --> 03:16:20,760
who is to maintain

11836
03:16:20,760 --> 03:16:20,960
you and

11837
03:16:20,960 --> 03:16:22,140
your father is dead.

11838
03:16:22,140 --> 03:16:23,120
I Shall not be able to

11839
03:16:23,120 --> 03:16:23,820
keep you.

11840
03:16:23,820 --> 03:16:25,280
And so I warn you,

11841
03:16:25,700 --> 03:16:26,520
I have done with you

11842
03:16:26,520 --> 03:16:27,440
from this very day.

11843
03:16:27,440 --> 03:16:28,040
I told you

11844
03:16:28,040 --> 03:16:28,580
in the library

11845
03:16:28,580 --> 03:16:29,060
you know that

11846
03:16:29,060 --> 03:16:29,520
I should never

11847
03:16:29,520 --> 03:16:30,420
speak to you again.

11848
03:16:30,420 --> 03:16:31,160
And you will find me

11849
03:16:31,160 --> 03:16:32,360
as good as my word.

11850
03:16:32,520 --> 03:16:33,300
I have no pleasure

11851
03:16:33,300 --> 03:16:33,780
in talking

11852
03:16:33,780 --> 03:16:34,120
to other

11853
03:16:34,120 --> 03:16:35,320
dutiful children.

11854
03:16:35,540 --> 03:16:36,120
Not that I have

11855
03:16:36,120 --> 03:16:36,660
much pleasure.

11856
03:16:36,660 --> 03:16:37,040
Indeed, in

11857
03:16:37,040 --> 03:16:38,240
talking to anybody.

11858
03:16:38,300 --> 03:16:39,060
People who suffer

11859
03:16:39,060 --> 03:16:39,480
as I do

11860
03:16:39,480 --> 03:16:40,580
from nervous complaints

11861
03:16:40,580 --> 03:16:41,340
and have no great

11862
03:16:41,340 --> 03:16:42,800
inclination talking.

11863
03:16:43,100 --> 03:16:43,920
Nobody can tell

11864
03:16:43,920 --> 03:16:45,180
which I suffer, but

11865
03:16:45,180 --> 03:16:46,380
it is always so.

11866
03:16:46,440 --> 03:16:46,760
Those

11867
03:16:46,760 --> 03:16:47,680
who did not complain

11868
03:16:47,680 --> 03:16:48,880
and ever pitied.

11869
03:16:49,160 --> 03:16:49,800
Her daughters

11870
03:16:49,800 --> 03:16:50,780
listened in silence

11871
03:16:50,780 --> 03:16:51,800
to this effusion.

11872
03:16:51,800 --> 03:16:52,500
Sensible.

11873
03:16:52,500 --> 03:16:53,060
Any attempts

11874
03:16:53,060 --> 03:16:53,880
to reason with her

11875
03:16:53,880 --> 03:16:54,360
or soothe

11876
03:16:54,360 --> 03:16:55,320
her would only increase

11877
03:16:55,320 --> 03:16:56,480
the irritation.

11878
03:16:56,480 --> 03:16:57,240
She talked on.

11879
03:16:57,240 --> 03:16:57,660
There for

11880
03:16:57,660 --> 03:16:58,500
without interruption

11881
03:16:58,500 --> 03:16:59,420
from any of them

11882
03:16:59,420 --> 03:17:00,240
till they were joined

11883
03:17:00,240 --> 03:17:00,600
by Mr.

11884
03:17:00,600 --> 03:17:01,260
Collins,

11885
03:17:01,260 --> 03:17:02,000
who entered the room

11886
03:17:02,000 --> 03:17:03,140
with an more stately

11887
03:17:03,140 --> 03:17:03,920
than usual,

11888
03:17:03,920 --> 03:17:05,300
and on perceiving whom

11889
03:17:05,300 --> 03:17:06,500
she sent to the girls.

11890
03:17:06,740 --> 03:17:08,000
Now, I do insist

11891
03:17:08,000 --> 03:17:09,000
upon it that you,

11892
03:17:09,000 --> 03:17:09,780
all of you,

11893
03:17:09,780 --> 03:17:10,880
hold your tongues

11894
03:17:10,880 --> 03:17:11,820
and let me and Mr.

11895
03:17:11,820 --> 03:17:12,180
Collins

11896
03:17:12,180 --> 03:17:12,600
have a little

11897
03:17:12,600 --> 03:17:13,800
conversation together.

11898
03:17:14,300 --> 03:17:15,200
Elizabeth passed

11899
03:17:15,200 --> 03:17:16,400
quietly out of the room,

11900
03:17:16,580 --> 03:17:17,180
Jane and

11901
03:17:17,180 --> 03:17:18,300
Kitty following.

11902
03:17:18,300 --> 03:17:19,160
But Lydia stood

11903
03:17:19,160 --> 03:17:19,880
her ground,

11904
03:17:19,880 --> 03:17:20,760
determined to hear

11905
03:17:20,760 --> 03:17:21,080
all she.

11906
03:17:21,080 --> 03:17:22,100
Could and.

11907
03:17:22,100 --> 03:17:23,160
Charlotte detained

11908
03:17:23,160 --> 03:17:23,580
first

11909
03:17:23,580 --> 03:17:24,620
by the civility of Mr.

11910
03:17:24,620 --> 03:17:25,320
Collins.

11911
03:17:25,320 --> 03:17:25,560
Whose.

11912
03:17:25,560 --> 03:17:26,760
Inquiries after herself

11913
03:17:26,760 --> 03:17:27,120
and all her

11914
03:17:27,120 --> 03:17:28,320
family were very minute,

11915
03:17:28,520 --> 03:17:29,100
and then,

11916
03:17:29,100 --> 03:17:30,300
by a little curiosity,

11917
03:17:30,540 --> 03:17:31,500
satisfied

11918
03:17:31,500 --> 03:17:31,940
with walking

11919
03:17:31,940 --> 03:17:32,580
to the window

11920
03:17:32,580 --> 03:17:33,140
and pretending

11921
03:17:33,140 --> 03:17:34,320
not to hear.

11922
03:17:34,320 --> 03:17:35,780
In a doleful voice, Mrs.

11923
03:17:35,780 --> 03:17:36,480
Bennett began

11924
03:17:36,480 --> 03:17:37,020
the projected

11925
03:17:37,020 --> 03:17:38,220
conversation.

11926
03:17:38,280 --> 03:17:39,440
Oh, Mr.

11927
03:17:39,440 --> 03:17:40,640
Collins.

11928
03:17:40,880 --> 03:17:41,960
My dear Madam.

11929
03:17:41,960 --> 03:17:42,420
Replied.

11930
03:17:42,420 --> 03:17:44,160
He let us be forever

11931
03:17:44,160 --> 03:17:45,360
silent on this point.

11932
03:17:45,720 --> 03:17:46,760
Far be it from me.

11933
03:17:46,760 --> 03:17:48,060
He presently continued

11934
03:17:48,300 --> 03:17:48,860
in a voice

11935
03:17:48,860 --> 03:17:49,280
that marked

11936
03:17:49,280 --> 03:17:50,480
his displeasure.

11937
03:17:50,840 --> 03:17:51,860
To resent the behavior

11938
03:17:51,860 --> 03:17:53,060
of your daughter.

11939
03:17:53,460 --> 03:17:54,180
Resignation

11940
03:17:54,180 --> 03:17:54,840
to inevitable

11941
03:17:54,840 --> 03:17:55,440
evils is the

11942
03:17:55,440 --> 03:17:56,280
duty of us all

11943
03:17:57,660 --> 03:17:58,220
the peculiar

11944
03:17:58,220 --> 03:17:58,920
duty of a young

11945
03:17:58,920 --> 03:17:59,540
man who has been

11946
03:17:59,540 --> 03:18:00,240
so fortunate

11947
03:18:00,240 --> 03:18:00,960
as I have been

11948
03:18:00,960 --> 03:18:02,160
in early preferment,

11949
03:18:02,840 --> 03:18:03,380
and I trust

11950
03:18:03,380 --> 03:18:04,580
I am resigned.

11951
03:18:05,700 --> 03:18:06,720
Perhaps not the less

11952
03:18:06,720 --> 03:18:07,520
so from feeling

11953
03:18:07,520 --> 03:18:08,540
a doubt of my positive

11954
03:18:08,540 --> 03:18:08,940
happiness.

11955
03:18:08,940 --> 03:18:09,480
Had my fair

11956
03:18:09,480 --> 03:18:10,200
cousin honored me

11957
03:18:10,200 --> 03:18:11,400
with her hand.

11958
03:18:12,800 --> 03:18:13,080
For

11959
03:18:13,080 --> 03:18:14,280
I have often observed

11960
03:18:14,300 --> 03:18:15,060
that resignation

11961
03:18:15,060 --> 03:18:16,020
is never so perfect

11962
03:18:16,020 --> 03:18:16,700
as when the blessing

11963
03:18:16,700 --> 03:18:17,360
denied begins

11964
03:18:17,360 --> 03:18:18,180
to lose somewhat

11965
03:18:18,180 --> 03:18:18,720
of its value.

11966
03:18:18,720 --> 03:18:19,920
In our estimation.

11967
03:18:20,660 --> 03:18:21,180
You will not,

11968
03:18:21,180 --> 03:18:22,380
I hope, consider me

11969
03:18:22,560 --> 03:18:23,000
as showing

11970
03:18:23,000 --> 03:18:23,780
any disrespect

11971
03:18:23,780 --> 03:18:24,420
to your family,

11972
03:18:24,420 --> 03:18:25,620
my dear Madam,

11973
03:18:25,640 --> 03:18:26,540
by thus withdrawing

11974
03:18:26,540 --> 03:18:27,260
my pretensions

11975
03:18:27,260 --> 03:18:28,460
to your daughter's favor

11976
03:18:28,740 --> 03:18:29,360
without having

11977
03:18:29,360 --> 03:18:30,440
paid yourself and Mr.

11978
03:18:30,440 --> 03:18:30,740
Bennett

11979
03:18:30,740 --> 03:18:31,380
to the compliment

11980
03:18:31,380 --> 03:18:32,100
of requesting you

11981
03:18:32,100 --> 03:18:32,820
to interpose

11982
03:18:32,820 --> 03:18:33,500
your authority

11983
03:18:33,500 --> 03:18:34,700
in my behalf.

11984
03:18:34,920 --> 03:18:35,640
My conduct,

11985
03:18:35,640 --> 03:18:36,440
may I fear,

11986
03:18:36,440 --> 03:18:37,340
be objectionable

11987
03:18:37,340 --> 03:18:38,280
in having accepted

11988
03:18:38,280 --> 03:18:38,940
my decision

11989
03:18:38,940 --> 03:18:39,260
from your

11990
03:18:39,260 --> 03:18:40,340
daughter's lips

11991
03:18:40,340 --> 03:18:41,540
instead of your own.

11992
03:18:41,780 --> 03:18:42,320
But we are all

11993
03:18:42,320 --> 03:18:43,520
liable to error.

11994
03:18:43,700 --> 03:18:44,640
I have certainly meant

11995
03:18:44,640 --> 03:18:45,260
well through the

11996
03:18:45,260 --> 03:18:46,460
whole affair.

11997
03:18:46,460 --> 03:18:47,180
My object has

11998
03:18:47,180 --> 03:18:47,960
been to secure

11999
03:18:47,960 --> 03:18:48,720
an amiable

12000
03:18:48,720 --> 03:18:50,120
companion myself

12001
03:18:50,520 --> 03:18:51,860
with due consideration

12002
03:18:51,860 --> 03:18:52,560
for the advantage

12003
03:18:52,560 --> 03:18:53,760
of all your family.

12004
03:18:54,240 --> 03:18:55,100
And if my manner

12005
03:18:55,100 --> 03:18:55,440
has been

12006
03:18:55,440 --> 03:18:56,640
at all reprehensible,

12007
03:18:56,820 --> 03:18:57,200
I hear,

12008
03:18:57,200 --> 03:18:58,460
beg leave to apologize.

12009
03:18:59,760 --> 03:19:01,020
Chapter 21.

12010
03:19:02,420 --> 03:19:03,440
The discussion of Mr.

12011
03:19:03,440 --> 03:19:04,760
Collins's offer was now

12012
03:19:04,760 --> 03:19:05,960
nearly at an end,

12013
03:19:06,000 --> 03:19:07,160
and Elizabeth had only

12014
03:19:07,160 --> 03:19:07,680
to suffer

12015
03:19:07,680 --> 03:19:08,600
from the uncomfortable

12016
03:19:08,600 --> 03:19:09,780
feeling unnecessarily

12017
03:19:09,780 --> 03:19:10,680
attending it

12018
03:19:10,680 --> 03:19:11,540
and occasionally

12019
03:19:11,540 --> 03:19:12,560
from some peevish

12020
03:19:12,560 --> 03:19:13,800
allusions of her mother.

12021
03:19:14,340 --> 03:19:15,360
As for the gentleman

12022
03:19:15,360 --> 03:19:16,160
himself,

12023
03:19:16,160 --> 03:19:17,160
his feelings were

12024
03:19:17,160 --> 03:19:18,360
chiefly expressed

12025
03:19:18,420 --> 03:19:19,880
not embarrassment

12026
03:19:19,880 --> 03:19:21,180
or dejection, or

12027
03:19:21,180 --> 03:19:22,460
by trying to avoid her,

12028
03:19:22,760 --> 03:19:23,960
but by stiffness

12029
03:19:23,960 --> 03:19:24,500
of manner

12030
03:19:24,500 --> 03:19:25,920
and resentful silence.

12031
03:19:26,300 --> 03:19:27,800
He scarcely ever spoke

12032
03:19:27,800 --> 03:19:29,520
to her and assiduous

12033
03:19:29,520 --> 03:19:30,180
attentions

12034
03:19:30,180 --> 03:19:30,800
which she had been

12035
03:19:30,800 --> 03:19:32,240
so sensible of himself,

12036
03:19:32,480 --> 03:19:33,260
were transferred

12037
03:19:33,260 --> 03:19:34,200
for the rest of the day

12038
03:19:34,200 --> 03:19:35,400
to Miss Lucas,

12039
03:19:35,460 --> 03:19:36,320
whose civility

12040
03:19:36,320 --> 03:19:37,260
and listening to him

12041
03:19:37,260 --> 03:19:38,420
was a seasonable relief

12042
03:19:38,420 --> 03:19:40,220
to all, and especially

12043
03:19:40,220 --> 03:19:41,420
to her friend.

12044
03:19:41,780 --> 03:19:42,860
The morrow produced

12045
03:19:42,860 --> 03:19:44,060
no abatement of Mrs.

12046
03:19:44,060 --> 03:19:45,080
Bennett's ill humor

12047
03:19:45,080 --> 03:19:46,280
or ill health.

12048
03:19:46,280 --> 03:19:46,640
Mr.

12049
03:19:46,640 --> 03:19:47,720
Collins was also

12050
03:19:47,720 --> 03:19:47,940
in the

12051
03:19:47,940 --> 03:19:48,740
same state of

12052
03:19:48,740 --> 03:19:49,940
angry pride.

12053
03:19:50,340 --> 03:19:51,320
Elizabeth had hoped

12054
03:19:51,320 --> 03:19:52,160
that his resentment

12055
03:19:52,160 --> 03:19:53,360
might shorten his visit,

12056
03:19:53,600 --> 03:19:54,360
but his plan

12057
03:19:54,360 --> 03:19:55,040
did not appear

12058
03:19:55,040 --> 03:19:55,680
in the least

12059
03:19:55,680 --> 03:19:56,880
affected by it.

12060
03:19:57,060 --> 03:19:58,140
He was always to

12061
03:19:58,140 --> 03:19:59,340
gone on Saturday

12062
03:19:59,480 --> 03:20:00,780
and to Saturday.

12063
03:20:00,800 --> 03:20:02,000
He meant to stay.

12064
03:20:02,720 --> 03:20:03,680
After breakfast,

12065
03:20:03,680 --> 03:20:04,500
the girls walked

12066
03:20:04,500 --> 03:20:05,780
to Maritain to inquire

12067
03:20:05,780 --> 03:20:06,140
if Mr.

12068
03:20:06,140 --> 03:20:07,280
Wickham were returned

12069
03:20:07,280 --> 03:20:08,060
and to lament

12070
03:20:08,060 --> 03:20:09,020
over his absence

12071
03:20:09,020 --> 03:20:09,240
from the

12072
03:20:09,240 --> 03:20:10,440
Netherfield Ball.

12073
03:20:10,640 --> 03:20:11,540
He joined them on

12074
03:20:11,540 --> 03:20:12,740
their entering the town

12075
03:20:12,780 --> 03:20:13,620
and attended them

12076
03:20:13,620 --> 03:20:14,300
to their aunt's,

12077
03:20:14,300 --> 03:20:15,020
where his regret

12078
03:20:15,020 --> 03:20:16,100
and vexation

12079
03:20:16,100 --> 03:20:16,920
and the concern of

12080
03:20:16,920 --> 03:20:18,200
everybody was well

12081
03:20:18,200 --> 03:20:19,400
talked over

12082
03:20:19,520 --> 03:20:20,260
to Elizabeth.

12083
03:20:20,260 --> 03:20:20,720
However, he

12084
03:20:20,720 --> 03:20:21,960
voluntarily acknowledged

12085
03:20:21,960 --> 03:20:22,200
that the

12086
03:20:22,200 --> 03:20:23,460
necessity of his absence

12087
03:20:23,460 --> 03:20:25,040
had been self-imposed.

12088
03:20:25,380 --> 03:20:27,240
I found that he.

12089
03:20:27,600 --> 03:20:29,000
As the time Junior,

12090
03:20:29,000 --> 03:20:29,300
that I.

12091
03:20:29,300 --> 03:20:30,720
I'd better not meet Mr.

12092
03:20:30,720 --> 03:20:32,240
Darcy, that to.

12093
03:20:32,240 --> 03:20:32,600
Be in the.

12094
03:20:32,600 --> 03:20:33,980
Same room, the same.

12095
03:20:33,980 --> 03:20:34,860
Party with him

12096
03:20:34,860 --> 03:20:36,240
so many hours together.

12097
03:20:36,480 --> 03:20:37,400
Might be more

12098
03:20:37,400 --> 03:20:38,420
I could bear.

12099
03:20:38,420 --> 03:20:39,500
And that scenes

12100
03:20:39,500 --> 03:20:40,820
might arise unpleasant

12101
03:20:40,820 --> 03:20:42,180
to more than myself.

12102
03:20:43,200 --> 03:20:43,840
She highly

12103
03:20:43,840 --> 03:20:45,180
approved his forbearance

12104
03:20:45,360 --> 03:20:46,500
and they had leisure for

12105
03:20:46,500 --> 03:20:47,700
a full discussion of it

12106
03:20:47,820 --> 03:20:48,380
and for all

12107
03:20:48,380 --> 03:20:49,160
the commendation

12108
03:20:49,160 --> 03:20:49,560
which they

12109
03:20:49,560 --> 03:20:50,520
civilly bestowed

12110
03:20:50,520 --> 03:20:52,080
on each other as Wickham

12111
03:20:52,080 --> 03:20:53,040
and another officer

12112
03:20:53,040 --> 03:20:54,000
walked back with them

12113
03:20:54,000 --> 03:20:54,920
to Long Borne.

12114
03:20:54,920 --> 03:20:55,920
And during the walk

12115
03:20:55,920 --> 03:20:56,660
he particularly

12116
03:20:56,660 --> 03:20:57,860
attended to her

12117
03:20:58,080 --> 03:20:59,100
his accompanying them

12118
03:20:59,100 --> 03:20:59,300
with the

12119
03:20:59,300 --> 03:21:00,500
double advantage.

12120
03:21:00,500 --> 03:21:01,040
She felt

12121
03:21:01,040 --> 03:21:01,920
all the compliment

12122
03:21:01,920 --> 03:21:03,120
it offered to herself,

12123
03:21:03,140 --> 03:21:03,600
and it was

12124
03:21:03,600 --> 03:21:04,460
most acceptable

12125
03:21:04,460 --> 03:21:05,120
as an occasion

12126
03:21:05,120 --> 03:21:05,940
of introducing him

12127
03:21:05,940 --> 03:21:06,500
to her father

12128
03:21:06,500 --> 03:21:07,700
and mother.

12129
03:21:07,980 --> 03:21:09,200
Soon after their return,

12130
03:21:09,200 --> 03:21:10,200
a letter was delivered

12131
03:21:10,200 --> 03:21:11,220
to Mr. Bennett.

12132
03:21:11,220 --> 03:21:11,820
It came

12133
03:21:11,820 --> 03:21:13,020
from Netherfield.

12134
03:21:13,040 --> 03:21:14,280
The envelope contained

12135
03:21:14,280 --> 03:21:15,200
a sheet of elegant

12136
03:21:15,200 --> 03:21:15,780
little hot

12137
03:21:15,780 --> 03:21:16,760
pressed paper.

12138
03:21:16,760 --> 03:21:18,200
Well, with a lady's

12139
03:21:18,200 --> 03:21:19,500
fair flowing hand.

12140
03:21:19,740 --> 03:21:20,780
And Elizabeth saw her

12141
03:21:20,780 --> 03:21:21,200
sister's

12142
03:21:21,200 --> 03:21:22,320
countenance change

12143
03:21:22,320 --> 03:21:23,300
as she read it

12144
03:21:23,300 --> 03:21:24,320
and saw her dwelling

12145
03:21:24,320 --> 03:21:24,960
intently

12146
03:21:24,960 --> 03:21:25,860
on some particular

12147
03:21:25,860 --> 03:21:27,060
passages.

12148
03:21:27,080 --> 03:21:28,040
Jane recollected

12149
03:21:28,040 --> 03:21:29,060
herself soon.

12150
03:21:29,060 --> 03:21:29,580
And putting

12151
03:21:29,580 --> 03:21:30,620
the letter away,

12152
03:21:30,620 --> 03:21:31,440
tried to join

12153
03:21:31,440 --> 03:21:31,640
with her

12154
03:21:31,640 --> 03:21:32,640
usual cheerfulness

12155
03:21:32,640 --> 03:21:32,780
and the

12156
03:21:32,780 --> 03:21:33,980
general conversation.

12157
03:21:34,440 --> 03:21:35,300
But Elizabeth felt

12158
03:21:35,300 --> 03:21:36,020
an anxiety

12159
03:21:36,020 --> 03:21:36,680
on the subject

12160
03:21:36,680 --> 03:21:37,280
which drew off

12161
03:21:37,280 --> 03:21:37,920
her attention,

12162
03:21:37,920 --> 03:21:39,120
even from Wickham.

12163
03:21:39,200 --> 03:21:40,100
And no sooner had

12164
03:21:40,100 --> 03:21:41,040
he and his companion

12165
03:21:41,040 --> 03:21:41,960
taken leave

12166
03:21:41,960 --> 03:21:43,140
than a glance from Jane

12167
03:21:43,140 --> 03:21:43,680
invited her

12168
03:21:43,680 --> 03:21:44,960
to follow her upstairs.

12169
03:21:45,420 --> 03:21:45,860
When they had

12170
03:21:45,860 --> 03:21:46,500
gained their own.

12171
03:21:46,500 --> 03:21:47,120
Room.

12172
03:21:47,120 --> 03:21:47,700
Jane,

12173
03:21:47,700 --> 03:21:48,600
taking out the letter,

12174
03:21:48,600 --> 03:21:49,800
said,

12175
03:21:49,800 --> 03:21:50,340
This is from

12176
03:21:50,340 --> 03:21:51,540
Caroline Bingley.

12177
03:21:51,660 --> 03:21:52,680
What it contains

12178
03:21:52,680 --> 03:21:53,460
has surprised me

12179
03:21:53,460 --> 03:21:54,660
a good deal.

12180
03:21:54,740 --> 03:21:55,760
The whole party have.

12181
03:21:55,760 --> 03:21:56,580
Left Netherfield

12182
03:21:56,580 --> 03:21:57,500
by this time

12183
03:21:57,500 --> 03:21:58,340
and are on their way to.

12184
03:21:58,340 --> 03:21:59,240
Town

12185
03:21:59,240 --> 03:21:59,780
and without

12186
03:21:59,780 --> 03:22:00,540
any intention

12187
03:22:00,540 --> 03:22:01,740
of coming back again.

12188
03:22:01,940 --> 03:22:02,660
You shall hear

12189
03:22:02,660 --> 03:22:03,860
what she says.

12190
03:22:04,100 --> 03:22:05,040
She then read the

12191
03:22:05,040 --> 03:22:06,360
first sentence aloud.

12192
03:22:06,560 --> 03:22:07,440
Which comprised.

12193
03:22:07,440 --> 03:22:08,160
The information

12194
03:22:08,160 --> 03:22:08,720
of their having

12195
03:22:08,720 --> 03:22:09,440
just resolved

12196
03:22:09,440 --> 03:22:10,280
to follow their brother

12197
03:22:10,280 --> 03:22:11,480
to town directly

12198
03:22:11,580 --> 03:22:12,060
and of their

12199
03:22:12,060 --> 03:22:12,920
meaning to dine in

12200
03:22:12,920 --> 03:22:13,880
Grosvenor Street,

12201
03:22:13,880 --> 03:22:14,400
where Mr.

12202
03:22:14,400 --> 03:22:15,600
Hurst had a house.

12203
03:22:15,960 --> 03:22:16,700
The next was

12204
03:22:16,700 --> 03:22:17,900
in these words.

12205
03:22:18,200 --> 03:22:19,520
I do not pretend

12206
03:22:19,520 --> 03:22:20,580
to regret anything.

12207
03:22:20,580 --> 03:22:20,860
I shall

12208
03:22:20,860 --> 03:22:22,060
leave in Hertfordshire

12209
03:22:22,080 --> 03:22:23,840
except your society,

12210
03:22:23,840 --> 03:22:25,040
my dearest friend.

12211
03:22:25,220 --> 03:22:26,420
But we will hope

12212
03:22:26,600 --> 03:22:27,920
at some future period

12213
03:22:28,140 --> 03:22:29,420
to enjoy many returns

12214
03:22:29,420 --> 03:22:29,760
of that

12215
03:22:29,760 --> 03:22:31,020
delightful intercourse

12216
03:22:31,020 --> 03:22:31,880
we have known.

12217
03:22:31,880 --> 03:22:32,240
And in the.

12218
03:22:32,240 --> 03:22:32,840
Meanwhile,

12219
03:22:32,840 --> 03:22:33,420
I may lessen

12220
03:22:33,420 --> 03:22:34,500
the pain of separation.

12221
03:22:34,500 --> 03:22:35,700
By a very frequent

12222
03:22:35,780 --> 03:22:36,980
and most unreserved

12223
03:22:36,980 --> 03:22:38,180
correspondence.

12224
03:22:38,180 --> 03:22:39,360
I depend on you

12225
03:22:39,360 --> 03:22:40,560
for that.

12226
03:22:40,880 --> 03:22:42,020
To these high flown

12227
03:22:42,020 --> 03:22:42,620
expressions.

12228
03:22:42,620 --> 03:22:43,460
Elizabeth listened

12229
03:22:43,460 --> 03:22:43,760
with all

12230
03:22:43,760 --> 03:22:44,720
the insensibility

12231
03:22:44,720 --> 03:22:46,280
of distrust, and though

12232
03:22:46,280 --> 03:22:46,920
the suddenness

12233
03:22:46,920 --> 03:22:47,520
of their removal

12234
03:22:47,520 --> 03:22:48,540
surprised her.

12235
03:22:48,540 --> 03:22:48,980
She saw.

12236
03:22:48,980 --> 03:22:49,500
Nothing in

12237
03:22:49,500 --> 03:22:50,700
it really to lament.

12238
03:22:50,720 --> 03:22:51,500
It was not to be.

12239
03:22:51,500 --> 03:22:52,100
Suppose that

12240
03:22:52,100 --> 03:22:52,740
their absence

12241
03:22:52,740 --> 03:22:53,340
from Netherfield

12242
03:22:53,340 --> 03:22:54,000
would prevent Mr.

12243
03:22:54,000 --> 03:22:55,200
Bingley being there,

12244
03:22:55,280 --> 03:22:55,700
had asked

12245
03:22:55,700 --> 03:22:56,100
for the loss

12246
03:22:56,100 --> 03:22:57,300
of their society.

12247
03:22:57,320 --> 03:22:58,320
She was persuaded

12248
03:22:58,320 --> 03:22:59,580
that Jane must cease

12249
03:22:59,580 --> 03:23:00,440
to regard it

12250
03:23:00,440 --> 03:23:01,880
in the enjoyment of his.

12251
03:23:02,820 --> 03:23:04,340
It is unlucky, said.

12252
03:23:04,340 --> 03:23:04,980
She, after

12253
03:23:04,980 --> 03:23:06,180
a short pause.

12254
03:23:06,200 --> 03:23:07,040
That you should not

12255
03:23:07,040 --> 03:23:07,340
be able

12256
03:23:07,340 --> 03:23:08,160
to see your friends

12257
03:23:08,160 --> 03:23:08,700
before they leave

12258
03:23:08,700 --> 03:23:09,900
the country,

12259
03:23:09,900 --> 03:23:10,980
but maybe not hope.

12260
03:23:10,980 --> 03:23:11,580
That the period

12261
03:23:11,580 --> 03:23:11,960
of future.

12262
03:23:11,960 --> 03:23:13,100
Happiness to which Mr.

12263
03:23:13,100 --> 03:23:14,300
Bingley looks forward

12264
03:23:14,420 --> 03:23:15,380
may arrive

12265
03:23:15,380 --> 03:23:16,560
than she is aware.

12266
03:23:16,560 --> 03:23:17,540
And that the delightful.

12267
03:23:17,540 --> 03:23:18,060
Intercourse

12268
03:23:18,060 --> 03:23:18,420
you have known

12269
03:23:18,420 --> 03:23:19,140
as friends

12270
03:23:19,140 --> 03:23:19,700
will be renewed

12271
03:23:19,700 --> 03:23:19,980
with yet

12272
03:23:19,980 --> 03:23:21,060
greater satisfaction

12273
03:23:21,060 --> 03:23:22,260
as sisters.

12274
03:23:22,680 --> 03:23:23,100
Mr.

12275
03:23:23,100 --> 03:23:23,540
Bingley will

12276
03:23:23,540 --> 03:23:24,420
not be detained

12277
03:23:24,420 --> 03:23:25,620
in London them.

12278
03:23:26,460 --> 03:23:27,020
Caroline

12279
03:23:27,020 --> 03:23:27,960
decidedly says

12280
03:23:27,960 --> 03:23:28,400
that none of the.

12281
03:23:28,400 --> 03:23:29,180
Party will return

12282
03:23:29,180 --> 03:23:29,780
into Hertfordshire

12283
03:23:29,780 --> 03:23:30,680
this winter.

12284
03:23:30,680 --> 03:23:31,880
I will read it to you.

12285
03:23:32,280 --> 03:23:33,080
When my brother

12286
03:23:33,080 --> 03:23:34,320
left us yesterday.

12287
03:23:34,580 --> 03:23:35,580
He imagined that

12288
03:23:35,580 --> 03:23:36,120
the business

12289
03:23:36,120 --> 03:23:37,200
which took him to London

12290
03:23:37,200 --> 03:23:37,640
might be

12291
03:23:37,640 --> 03:23:38,520
concluded in three

12292
03:23:38,520 --> 03:23:39,680
or four days.

12293
03:23:39,680 --> 03:23:40,740
But as we are certain,

12294
03:23:40,740 --> 03:23:41,940
it cannot be so.

12295
03:23:42,080 --> 03:23:42,480
And at.

12296
03:23:42,480 --> 03:23:43,100
The same time

12297
03:23:43,100 --> 03:23:44,240
convinced that. When.

12298
03:23:44,240 --> 03:23:44,940
Charles gets.

12299
03:23:44,940 --> 03:23:45,380
To town,

12300
03:23:45,380 --> 03:23:45,740
he will be in

12301
03:23:45,740 --> 03:23:46,320
no hurry

12302
03:23:46,320 --> 03:23:47,460
to leave it again.

12303
03:23:47,460 --> 03:23:48,440
We have determined

12304
03:23:48,440 --> 03:23:49,640
on following him thither

12305
03:23:49,800 --> 03:23:50,580
that he may not.

12306
03:23:50,580 --> 03:23:51,120
Be obliged

12307
03:23:51,120 --> 03:23:51,500
to spend

12308
03:23:51,500 --> 03:23:52,560
his vacant hours.

12309
03:23:52,560 --> 03:23:53,120
In a comfort.

12310
03:23:53,120 --> 03:23:54,320
This hotel.

12311
03:23:54,420 --> 03:23:55,560
Many of my acquaintances

12312
03:23:55,560 --> 03:23:56,120
are already there

12313
03:23:56,120 --> 03:23:57,120
for the winter.

12314
03:23:57,120 --> 03:23:58,140
I wish that I could

12315
03:23:58,140 --> 03:23:59,000
hear that you,

12316
03:23:59,000 --> 03:24:00,260
my dearest friend,

12317
03:24:00,260 --> 03:24:01,200
had any intention

12318
03:24:01,200 --> 03:24:01,520
of making

12319
03:24:01,520 --> 03:24:02,720
one of the crowd.

12320
03:24:02,760 --> 03:24:04,160
But of that I despair.

12321
03:24:04,680 --> 03:24:05,700
I sincerely hope

12322
03:24:05,700 --> 03:24:06,180
your Christmas

12323
03:24:06,180 --> 03:24:06,900
in Hertfordshire

12324
03:24:06,900 --> 03:24:08,120
may abound in the cities

12325
03:24:08,120 --> 03:24:08,880
which that season

12326
03:24:08,880 --> 03:24:10,080
generally brings,

12327
03:24:10,080 --> 03:24:10,940
and that your bows

12328
03:24:10,940 --> 03:24:12,120
will be so numerous

12329
03:24:12,120 --> 03:24:12,620
as to prevent

12330
03:24:12,620 --> 03:24:13,140
your fitting.

12331
03:24:13,140 --> 03:24:13,700
The loss of the.

12332
03:24:13,700 --> 03:24:14,340
Three.

12333
03:24:14,340 --> 03:24:15,180
Whom we shall.

12334
03:24:15,180 --> 03:24:15,980
Deprive you.

12335
03:24:16,980 --> 03:24:17,360
It is

12336
03:24:17,360 --> 03:24:18,620
evident by this

12337
03:24:18,960 --> 03:24:20,040
added Jane,

12338
03:24:20,040 --> 03:24:20,840
that he comes back

12339
03:24:20,840 --> 03:24:22,040
no more this winter.

12340
03:24:22,760 --> 03:24:23,960
It is only evident

12341
03:24:24,240 --> 03:24:24,860
Miss Bingley.

12342
03:24:24,860 --> 03:24:25,440
Does not mean

12343
03:24:25,440 --> 03:24:26,640
that he should.

12344
03:24:27,060 --> 03:24:28,380
Why would you think so?

12345
03:24:28,640 --> 03:24:29,280
It must be

12346
03:24:29,280 --> 03:24:30,260
his own doing.

12347
03:24:30,260 --> 03:24:31,740
He is his own master.

12348
03:24:32,400 --> 03:24:33,900
But you do not know all.

12349
03:24:34,140 --> 03:24:35,060
I will read you

12350
03:24:35,060 --> 03:24:35,640
the passage,

12351
03:24:35,640 --> 03:24:36,540
which particularly

12352
03:24:36,540 --> 03:24:37,500
hurts me.

12353
03:24:37,500 --> 03:24:38,660
I will have no reserves

12354
03:24:38,660 --> 03:24:39,860
from you.

12355
03:24:40,280 --> 03:24:40,760
Mr.

12356
03:24:40,760 --> 03:24:42,420
Darcy is impatient

12357
03:24:42,420 --> 03:24:43,620
to see his sister

12358
03:24:43,800 --> 03:24:44,640
and to confess

12359
03:24:44,640 --> 03:24:45,440
the truth.

12360
03:24:45,440 --> 03:24:47,120
We are scarcely less

12361
03:24:47,120 --> 03:24:48,320
eager to meet her again.

12362
03:24:48,800 --> 03:24:49,920
I really do not think

12363
03:24:49,920 --> 03:24:50,940
Georgiana Darcy

12364
03:24:50,940 --> 03:24:51,740
has her equal

12365
03:24:51,740 --> 03:24:53,000
for beauty, elegance

12366
03:24:53,000 --> 03:24:54,200
and accomplished sense.

12367
03:24:54,300 --> 03:24:55,380
And the affection she.

12368
03:24:55,380 --> 03:24:56,520
Inspires in Louisa

12369
03:24:56,520 --> 03:24:57,060
and myself.

12370
03:24:57,060 --> 03:24:57,560
Is heightened

12371
03:24:57,560 --> 03:24:58,140
into something

12372
03:24:58,140 --> 03:24:59,580
still more interesting

12373
03:24:59,880 --> 03:25:00,540
from the hope

12374
03:25:00,540 --> 03:25:02,000
we dare entertain of her

12375
03:25:02,000 --> 03:25:03,840
being here after Alice.

12376
03:25:04,980 --> 03:25:05,700
I do not

12377
03:25:05,700 --> 03:25:06,380
know whether I

12378
03:25:06,380 --> 03:25:06,960
ever before

12379
03:25:06,960 --> 03:25:07,700
mentioned to you

12380
03:25:07,700 --> 03:25:08,300
my feelings

12381
03:25:08,300 --> 03:25:09,500
on this subject, but

12382
03:25:09,500 --> 03:25:10,040
I will not

12383
03:25:10,040 --> 03:25:10,700
leave the country

12384
03:25:10,700 --> 03:25:11,900
without confiding them,

12385
03:25:12,020 --> 03:25:12,600
and I trust

12386
03:25:12,600 --> 03:25:12,900
you will not.

12387
03:25:12,900 --> 03:25:13,400
Esteem them.

12388
03:25:13,400 --> 03:25:14,600
Unreason all.

12389
03:25:14,760 --> 03:25:16,160
My brother admires

12390
03:25:16,160 --> 03:25:17,360
her greatly already.

12391
03:25:17,420 --> 03:25:18,420
He will have frequent

12392
03:25:18,420 --> 03:25:19,020
opportunity

12393
03:25:19,020 --> 03:25:19,700
now of seeing her

12394
03:25:19,700 --> 03:25:20,120
on the most

12395
03:25:20,120 --> 03:25:21,320
intimate footing.

12396
03:25:21,420 --> 03:25:22,160
Her relations

12397
03:25:22,160 --> 03:25:23,280
all wish the connection

12398
03:25:23,280 --> 03:25:24,480
as much as his

12399
03:25:24,500 --> 03:25:25,320
and a sister's

12400
03:25:25,320 --> 03:25:26,040
partiality

12401
03:25:26,040 --> 03:25:27,200
is not misleading me,

12402
03:25:27,200 --> 03:25:27,840
I think.

12403
03:25:27,840 --> 03:25:28,880
When I call Charles

12404
03:25:28,880 --> 03:25:30,560
most capable of engaging

12405
03:25:30,560 --> 03:25:31,760
any woman's heart

12406
03:25:32,160 --> 03:25:32,660
with all

12407
03:25:32,660 --> 03:25:33,780
these circumstances

12408
03:25:33,780 --> 03:25:35,000
to favor an attachment

12409
03:25:35,280 --> 03:25:36,360
and nothing

12410
03:25:36,360 --> 03:25:37,500
to prevent it.

12411
03:25:37,500 --> 03:25:38,360
Am I wrong?

12412
03:25:38,360 --> 03:25:39,560
My dearest Jane,

12413
03:25:39,600 --> 03:25:40,740
in indulging the hope of

12414
03:25:40,740 --> 03:25:41,060
an event

12415
03:25:41,060 --> 03:25:41,240
which

12416
03:25:41,240 --> 03:25:41,640
to secure

12417
03:25:41,640 --> 03:25:42,320
the happiness

12418
03:25:42,320 --> 03:25:43,520
of so many.

12419
03:25:43,700 --> 03:25:44,340
What do you think

12420
03:25:44,340 --> 03:25:45,380
of this sentence,

12421
03:25:45,380 --> 03:25:45,780
my dear?

12422
03:25:45,780 --> 03:25:47,280
Lizzie said to Jane

12423
03:25:47,280 --> 03:25:48,480
as she finished it.

12424
03:25:48,540 --> 03:25:49,820
Is it not clear enough?

12425
03:25:50,160 --> 03:25:51,320
Does it not expressly.

12426
03:25:51,320 --> 03:25:51,800
Declare that

12427
03:25:51,800 --> 03:25:52,320
Caroline

12428
03:25:52,320 --> 03:25:53,480
neither expects,

12429
03:25:53,480 --> 03:25:54,020
wishes me

12430
03:25:54,020 --> 03:25:55,160
to be her sister.

12431
03:25:55,160 --> 03:25:55,560
But she is

12432
03:25:55,560 --> 03:25:56,520
perfectly convinced

12433
03:25:56,520 --> 03:25:56,720
of her

12434
03:25:56,720 --> 03:25:57,900
brother's indifference,

12435
03:25:57,900 --> 03:25:59,060
and that if she suspects

12436
03:25:59,060 --> 03:25:59,480
the nature

12437
03:25:59,480 --> 03:26:00,680
of my feelings for him,

12438
03:26:00,840 --> 03:26:02,240
she means most kindly

12439
03:26:02,240 --> 03:26:03,440
to put me on my God.

12440
03:26:03,780 --> 03:26:04,380
Can there be

12441
03:26:04,380 --> 03:26:05,180
any other opinion

12442
03:26:05,180 --> 03:26:06,380
on the subject?

12443
03:26:06,680 --> 03:26:07,880
He has that can

12444
03:26:07,920 --> 03:26:08,340
for mine

12445
03:26:08,340 --> 03:26:09,540
is totally different.

12446
03:26:09,740 --> 03:26:10,940
Will you hear it

12447
03:26:11,340 --> 03:26:12,540
most willingly?

12448
03:26:12,900 --> 03:26:13,640
You have it

12449
03:26:13,640 --> 03:26:14,760
in a few words.

12450
03:26:14,760 --> 03:26:15,500
Miss Bingley.

12451
03:26:15,500 --> 03:26:16,100
Sees that

12452
03:26:16,100 --> 03:26:16,700
her brother is in

12453
03:26:16,700 --> 03:26:17,480
love with you and.

12454
03:26:17,480 --> 03:26:18,380
Wants him to marry

12455
03:26:18,380 --> 03:26:19,460
Miss Darcy.

12456
03:26:19,460 --> 03:26:20,640
She follows him to town

12457
03:26:20,640 --> 03:26:21,000
in hope

12458
03:26:21,000 --> 03:26:21,920
of keeping him there

12459
03:26:21,920 --> 03:26:22,580
and tries

12460
03:26:22,580 --> 03:26:23,300
to persuade you

12461
03:26:23,300 --> 03:26:23,940
that he does not

12462
03:26:23,940 --> 03:26:25,140
care about you.

12463
03:26:25,200 --> 03:26:26,400
Jane shook her head.

12464
03:26:27,000 --> 03:26:27,920
Indeed, Jane.

12465
03:26:27,920 --> 03:26:29,400
You ought to believe me.

12466
03:26:29,720 --> 03:26:30,920
No one who has ever seen

12467
03:26:30,920 --> 03:26:31,380
you together

12468
03:26:31,380 --> 03:26:32,580
can doubt his affection.

12469
03:26:32,840 --> 03:26:33,500
Miss being the

12470
03:26:33,500 --> 03:26:34,740
I am sure cannot.

12471
03:26:35,000 --> 03:26:35,820
She is not

12472
03:26:35,820 --> 03:26:37,020
such a simpleton.

12473
03:26:37,040 --> 03:26:37,940
Could she have seen

12474
03:26:37,940 --> 03:26:38,480
half as.

12475
03:26:38,480 --> 03:26:39,260
Much love in Mr.

12476
03:26:39,260 --> 03:26:40,440
Darcy for herself?

12477
03:26:40,440 --> 03:26:41,060
She would have

12478
03:26:41,060 --> 03:26:41,540
ordered her

12479
03:26:41,540 --> 03:26:42,740
wedding clothes.

12480
03:26:42,860 --> 03:26:44,040
But the case is this.

12481
03:26:44,040 --> 03:26:45,060
We are not rich enough

12482
03:26:45,060 --> 03:26:45,660
or grand

12483
03:26:45,660 --> 03:26:46,520
enough for them.

12484
03:26:46,520 --> 03:26:47,040
And she is

12485
03:26:47,040 --> 03:26:47,940
the more anxious to.

12486
03:26:47,940 --> 03:26:48,360
Get Miss.

12487
03:26:48,360 --> 03:26:49,560
Darcy for her brother.

12488
03:26:49,640 --> 03:26:50,400
From the notion

12489
03:26:50,400 --> 03:26:51,300
that when there has been

12490
03:26:51,300 --> 03:26:52,500
one into marriage,

12491
03:26:52,520 --> 03:26:53,360
she may have less.

12492
03:26:53,360 --> 03:26:53,820
Trouble in

12493
03:26:53,820 --> 03:26:55,020
achieving a second.

12494
03:26:55,140 --> 03:26:55,980
In which there is

12495
03:26:55,980 --> 03:26:56,520
certainly

12496
03:26:56,520 --> 03:26:57,560
some ingenuity.

12497
03:26:57,560 --> 03:26:58,200
And I dare

12498
03:26:58,200 --> 03:26:59,400
say it would succeed

12499
03:26:59,540 --> 03:27:00,420
if Mr.

12500
03:27:00,420 --> 03:27:00,960
Burke were

12501
03:27:00,960 --> 03:27:02,160
out of the way.

12502
03:27:02,240 --> 03:27:03,500
But my dearest Jane,

12503
03:27:03,500 --> 03:27:03,980
you cannot

12504
03:27:03,980 --> 03:27:05,040
seriously imagine.

12505
03:27:05,040 --> 03:27:05,700
That because Miss

12506
03:27:05,700 --> 03:27:06,380
Bailey tells

12507
03:27:06,380 --> 03:27:06,920
you her brother

12508
03:27:06,920 --> 03:27:08,020
greatly admires Ms..

12509
03:27:08,020 --> 03:27:08,720
Darcy.

12510
03:27:08,720 --> 03:27:09,200
He is in the

12511
03:27:09,200 --> 03:27:10,160
smallest degree, less

12512
03:27:10,160 --> 03:27:10,740
sensible of

12513
03:27:10,740 --> 03:27:11,520
your marriage

12514
03:27:11,520 --> 03:27:12,080
than when he took

12515
03:27:12,080 --> 03:27:13,280
leave you on Tuesday,

12516
03:27:13,620 --> 03:27:14,340
or that it would be

12517
03:27:14,340 --> 03:27:15,000
in her power

12518
03:27:15,000 --> 03:27:16,200
to persuade him that

12519
03:27:16,340 --> 03:27:16,860
instead of

12520
03:27:16,860 --> 03:27:17,900
being in love with you,

12521
03:27:17,900 --> 03:27:18,660
he is very much in

12522
03:27:18,660 --> 03:27:19,860
love with a friend.

12523
03:27:19,920 --> 03:27:21,080
If we thought alike.

12524
03:27:21,080 --> 03:27:23,060
Of Miss, replied Jane,

12525
03:27:23,400 --> 03:27:24,360
your representation

12526
03:27:24,360 --> 03:27:24,560
of all

12527
03:27:24,560 --> 03:27:25,200
this might make

12528
03:27:25,200 --> 03:27:26,400
me quite easy.

12529
03:27:26,520 --> 03:27:27,080
But I know

12530
03:27:27,080 --> 03:27:27,780
the foundation

12531
03:27:27,780 --> 03:27:28,800
is unjust.

12532
03:27:28,800 --> 03:27:30,140
Caroline is incapable

12533
03:27:30,140 --> 03:27:30,800
of willfully

12534
03:27:30,800 --> 03:27:32,000
deceiving anyone.

12535
03:27:32,120 --> 03:27:32,700
And all that

12536
03:27:32,700 --> 03:27:33,980
I can hope in this case.

12537
03:27:33,980 --> 03:27:35,280
Is that she is deceiving

12538
03:27:35,280 --> 03:27:36,480
herself.

12539
03:27:36,800 --> 03:27:37,260
That is.

12540
03:27:37,260 --> 03:27:37,880
Right.

12541
03:27:37,880 --> 03:27:38,420
You could not

12542
03:27:38,420 --> 03:27:39,020
have started

12543
03:27:39,020 --> 03:27:40,200
a more happy idea

12544
03:27:40,200 --> 03:27:41,060
since you will not

12545
03:27:41,060 --> 03:27:42,260
comfort in mine.

12546
03:27:42,420 --> 03:27:43,040
Believe had

12547
03:27:43,040 --> 03:27:43,880
to be deceived

12548
03:27:43,880 --> 03:27:45,060
by all means.

12549
03:27:45,060 --> 03:27:45,960
You have now done

12550
03:27:45,960 --> 03:27:46,820
your duty by.

12551
03:27:46,820 --> 03:27:47,400
Her and.

12552
03:27:47,400 --> 03:27:48,800
Must fret no longer.

12553
03:27:49,640 --> 03:27:50,900
But my dear sister,

12554
03:27:50,900 --> 03:27:52,100
can I be happy?

12555
03:27:52,100 --> 03:27:53,460
Even supposing the best.

12556
03:27:53,660 --> 03:27:54,740
In accepting a man

12557
03:27:54,740 --> 03:27:55,340
whose sisters

12558
03:27:55,340 --> 03:27:55,860
and friends

12559
03:27:55,860 --> 03:27:56,580
are all wishing him

12560
03:27:56,580 --> 03:27:57,780
to marry elsewhere?

12561
03:27:58,460 --> 03:27:59,360
You must decide

12562
03:27:59,360 --> 03:28:00,500
for yourself.

12563
03:28:00,500 --> 03:28:01,620
Said Elizabeth.

12564
03:28:01,620 --> 03:28:02,180
And if.

12565
03:28:02,180 --> 03:28:02,780
Upon mature

12566
03:28:02,780 --> 03:28:03,620
deliberation, you.

12567
03:28:03,620 --> 03:28:04,080
Find that

12568
03:28:04,080 --> 03:28:05,460
the misery of disabling

12569
03:28:05,460 --> 03:28:06,660
his two sisters is more

12570
03:28:06,660 --> 03:28:07,160
than equivalent

12571
03:28:07,160 --> 03:28:07,760
to the happiness

12572
03:28:07,760 --> 03:28:08,100
of being.

12573
03:28:08,100 --> 03:28:09,680
His wife, I advise you,

12574
03:28:09,680 --> 03:28:10,500
by all means,

12575
03:28:10,500 --> 03:28:11,700
to refuse him.

12576
03:28:12,180 --> 03:28:13,140
How can you talk?

12577
03:28:13,140 --> 03:28:14,000
So?

12578
03:28:14,000 --> 03:28:14,660
Said Jane,

12579
03:28:14,660 --> 03:28:15,860
faintly, smiling.

12580
03:28:16,140 --> 03:28:17,120
You must know

12581
03:28:17,120 --> 03:28:17,460
that, though

12582
03:28:17,460 --> 03:28:17,840
I should be

12583
03:28:17,840 --> 03:28:18,980
exceedingly grieved

12584
03:28:18,980 --> 03:28:20,180
at their disapprobation.

12585
03:28:20,400 --> 03:28:21,720
I could not hesitate.

12586
03:28:22,500 --> 03:28:23,180
I did not think

12587
03:28:23,180 --> 03:28:24,080
you would.

12588
03:28:24,080 --> 03:28:24,680
And that.

12589
03:28:24,680 --> 03:28:25,500
Being the case.

12590
03:28:25,500 --> 03:28:26,420
I cannot consider

12591
03:28:26,420 --> 03:28:27,080
your situation

12592
03:28:27,080 --> 03:28:28,340
with much compassion.

12593
03:28:29,240 --> 03:28:30,200
But if he returns

12594
03:28:30,200 --> 03:28:31,260
more this winter,

12595
03:28:31,260 --> 03:28:31,820
my choice will

12596
03:28:31,820 --> 03:28:33,020
never be required.

12597
03:28:33,180 --> 03:28:34,280
A thousand things

12598
03:28:34,280 --> 03:28:35,780
may arise in six months.

12599
03:28:36,620 --> 03:28:37,260
The idea

12600
03:28:37,260 --> 03:28:37,980
of his returning

12601
03:28:37,980 --> 03:28:38,460
no more

12602
03:28:38,460 --> 03:28:39,260
Elizabeth, treated

12603
03:28:39,260 --> 03:28:40,080
with the utmost

12604
03:28:40,080 --> 03:28:40,980
contempt,

12605
03:28:40,980 --> 03:28:41,780
it appeared to her

12606
03:28:41,780 --> 03:28:42,120
merely

12607
03:28:42,120 --> 03:28:42,720
the suggestion

12608
03:28:42,720 --> 03:28:43,440
of Caroline's

12609
03:28:43,440 --> 03:28:44,540
interested wishes.

12610
03:28:44,540 --> 03:28:44,960
And she could

12611
03:28:44,960 --> 03:28:45,840
not for a moment.

12612
03:28:45,840 --> 03:28:46,440
Suppose that

12613
03:28:46,440 --> 03:28:47,660
those wishes, however

12614
03:28:47,660 --> 03:28:48,180
openly or

12615
03:28:48,180 --> 03:28:49,380
artfully spoken,

12616
03:28:49,400 --> 03:28:50,160
could influence

12617
03:28:50,160 --> 03:28:51,420
a young man so totally

12618
03:28:51,420 --> 03:28:52,800
independent of everyone

12619
03:28:53,600 --> 03:28:54,320
she represented

12620
03:28:54,320 --> 03:28:54,900
to her sister

12621
03:28:54,900 --> 03:28:56,160
as forcibly as possible

12622
03:28:56,160 --> 03:28:56,720
what she felt

12623
03:28:56,720 --> 03:28:57,680
on the subject,

12624
03:28:57,680 --> 03:28:58,440
and had soon

12625
03:28:58,440 --> 03:28:59,280
the pleasure of seeing

12626
03:28:59,280 --> 03:29:00,480
its happy effect.

12627
03:29:00,500 --> 03:29:01,340
James temper

12628
03:29:01,340 --> 03:29:02,540
was not responding,

12629
03:29:02,660 --> 03:29:03,080
and she was

12630
03:29:03,080 --> 03:29:04,280
gradually led to hope.

12631
03:29:04,580 --> 03:29:05,480
Though the diffidence

12632
03:29:05,480 --> 03:29:06,120
of affection

12633
03:29:06,120 --> 03:29:07,020
sometimes overcame

12634
03:29:07,020 --> 03:29:08,340
the hope that Bingley

12635
03:29:08,340 --> 03:29:08,820
would return

12636
03:29:08,820 --> 03:29:09,500
to Netherfield

12637
03:29:09,500 --> 03:29:10,380
and answer

12638
03:29:10,380 --> 03:29:11,580
wish of her heart.

12639
03:29:12,000 --> 03:29:12,980
They agreed that Mrs.

12640
03:29:12,980 --> 03:29:13,880
Bennett should only hear

12641
03:29:13,880 --> 03:29:14,520
of the departure

12642
03:29:14,520 --> 03:29:15,360
of the family

12643
03:29:15,360 --> 03:29:16,380
without being alarmed

12644
03:29:16,380 --> 03:29:16,800
on the score

12645
03:29:16,800 --> 03:29:16,940
of the

12646
03:29:16,940 --> 03:29:18,140
gentleman's conduct.

12647
03:29:18,260 --> 03:29:18,780
But even

12648
03:29:18,780 --> 03:29:19,400
this partial

12649
03:29:19,400 --> 03:29:20,060
communication

12650
03:29:20,060 --> 03:29:20,400
gave her

12651
03:29:20,400 --> 03:29:21,740
a great deal of concern.

12652
03:29:21,960 --> 03:29:22,260
And she.

12653
03:29:22,260 --> 03:29:22,860
Bewildered

12654
03:29:22,860 --> 03:29:24,060
as exceedingly unlucky

12655
03:29:24,060 --> 03:29:24,560
that the lady

12656
03:29:24,560 --> 03:29:25,020
should happen

12657
03:29:25,020 --> 03:29:25,520
to go away,

12658
03:29:25,520 --> 03:29:25,940
just as they

12659
03:29:25,940 --> 03:29:26,520
were all getting

12660
03:29:26,520 --> 03:29:27,720
so intimate together.

12661
03:29:28,140 --> 03:29:29,060
After lamenting it,

12662
03:29:29,060 --> 03:29:30,260
however, at some length,

12663
03:29:30,360 --> 03:29:31,460
she had the consolation

12664
03:29:31,460 --> 03:29:31,860
that Mr.

12665
03:29:31,860 --> 03:29:32,280
Bingley would

12666
03:29:32,280 --> 03:29:33,380
soon be down again

12667
03:29:33,380 --> 03:29:33,860
and soon

12668
03:29:33,860 --> 03:29:35,060
dining at Long Bourn.

12669
03:29:35,120 --> 03:29:35,420
And the

12670
03:29:35,420 --> 03:29:36,740
conclusion of all was

12671
03:29:36,740 --> 03:29:37,260
the comfortable

12672
03:29:37,260 --> 03:29:38,160
declaration

12673
03:29:38,160 --> 03:29:38,700
that though

12674
03:29:38,700 --> 03:29:39,480
he had been invited

12675
03:29:39,480 --> 03:29:40,700
only to a family dinner,

12676
03:29:40,940 --> 03:29:42,060
she would take care to

12677
03:29:42,060 --> 03:29:43,640
have two full courses.

12678
03:29:45,840 --> 03:29:47,060
Chapter 22.

12679
03:29:48,200 --> 03:29:48,900
The Bennetts were

12680
03:29:48,900 --> 03:29:49,740
engaged to dine

12681
03:29:49,740 --> 03:29:50,540
with the Lucas's

12682
03:29:50,540 --> 03:29:51,120
and again

12683
03:29:51,120 --> 03:29:51,860
during the chief of

12684
03:29:51,860 --> 03:29:53,000
the day was Miss Lucas,

12685
03:29:53,000 --> 03:29:53,640
so kind

12686
03:29:53,640 --> 03:29:54,540
as to listen to Mr.

12687
03:29:54,540 --> 03:29:55,440
Collins.

12688
03:29:55,440 --> 03:29:56,180
Elizabeth took

12689
03:29:56,180 --> 03:29:56,900
an opportunity

12690
03:29:56,900 --> 03:29:58,100
of thanking her.

12691
03:29:58,140 --> 03:29:59,280
It keeps him in good

12692
03:29:59,280 --> 03:30:00,660
humor, said she.

12693
03:30:00,960 --> 03:30:01,340
And I am.

12694
03:30:01,340 --> 03:30:02,240
More obliged to you

12695
03:30:02,240 --> 03:30:03,440
than I can express.

12696
03:30:04,040 --> 03:30:04,940
Charlotte assured,

12697
03:30:04,940 --> 03:30:05,360
her friend

12698
03:30:05,360 --> 03:30:06,240
of her satisfaction

12699
03:30:06,240 --> 03:30:07,260
in being useful

12700
03:30:07,260 --> 03:30:08,060
and that it amply

12701
03:30:08,060 --> 03:30:08,640
repaid her

12702
03:30:08,640 --> 03:30:09,060
for the little

12703
03:30:09,060 --> 03:30:10,260
sacrifice of her time.

12704
03:30:10,760 --> 03:30:12,200
This was very amiable.

12705
03:30:12,440 --> 03:30:13,700
But Charlotte's kindness

12706
03:30:13,700 --> 03:30:14,580
extended farther

12707
03:30:14,580 --> 03:30:15,300
than Elizabeth had.

12708
03:30:15,300 --> 03:30:16,500
Any conception of.

12709
03:30:16,520 --> 03:30:17,400
Its object.

12710
03:30:17,400 --> 03:30:18,200
Was nothing else

12711
03:30:18,200 --> 03:30:19,040
than to secure her

12712
03:30:19,040 --> 03:30:20,180
from any return of Mr.

12713
03:30:20,180 --> 03:30:21,360
Collins addresses

12714
03:30:21,360 --> 03:30:22,280
by engaging them

12715
03:30:22,280 --> 03:30:23,480
towards herself.

12716
03:30:23,720 --> 03:30:24,980
Such was Miss Lucas's

12717
03:30:24,980 --> 03:30:26,600
scheme, and appearances

12718
03:30:26,600 --> 03:30:27,680
were so favorable

12719
03:30:27,680 --> 03:30:28,160
that when they

12720
03:30:28,160 --> 03:30:29,240
parted at night,

12721
03:30:29,240 --> 03:30:30,020
she would have felt

12722
03:30:30,020 --> 03:30:31,500
almost secure of success

12723
03:30:31,500 --> 03:30:32,240
if he had not been

12724
03:30:32,240 --> 03:30:33,140
to leave Hertfordshire

12725
03:30:33,140 --> 03:30:34,320
so very soon.

12726
03:30:34,320 --> 03:30:35,460
But here she did

12727
03:30:35,460 --> 03:30:36,900
injustice to the fire

12728
03:30:36,900 --> 03:30:37,800
and independence

12729
03:30:37,800 --> 03:30:39,240
of his character, for it

12730
03:30:39,240 --> 03:30:40,200
led him to escape

12731
03:30:40,200 --> 03:30:41,220
out of Long Bourne house

12732
03:30:41,220 --> 03:30:41,940
the next morning

12733
03:30:41,940 --> 03:30:42,500
with Admiral

12734
03:30:42,500 --> 03:30:43,440
Slyness and.

12735
03:30:43,440 --> 03:30:43,860
Hastened.

12736
03:30:43,860 --> 03:30:44,720
To Lucas Lodge

12737
03:30:44,720 --> 03:30:45,620
to throw himself

12738
03:30:45,620 --> 03:30:46,580
at her feet.

12739
03:30:46,580 --> 03:30:47,780
He was anxious to avoid

12740
03:30:47,780 --> 03:30:48,200
the notice

12741
03:30:48,200 --> 03:30:49,100
of his cousins

12742
03:30:49,100 --> 03:30:49,920
from a conviction

12743
03:30:49,920 --> 03:30:50,280
that if they

12744
03:30:50,280 --> 03:30:51,300
saw him depart,

12745
03:30:51,300 --> 03:30:52,140
they could not fail

12746
03:30:52,140 --> 03:30:52,800
to conjecture

12747
03:30:52,800 --> 03:30:53,940
his design and.

12748
03:30:53,940 --> 03:30:54,480
He was not.

12749
03:30:54,480 --> 03:30:55,100
Willing to have

12750
03:30:55,100 --> 03:30:55,580
the attempt

12751
03:30:55,580 --> 03:30:56,780
known till its success

12752
03:30:56,780 --> 03:30:57,400
might be known.

12753
03:30:57,400 --> 03:30:58,380
Likewise,

12754
03:30:58,380 --> 03:30:59,180
for the feeling

12755
03:30:59,180 --> 03:31:00,300
almost secure

12756
03:31:00,300 --> 03:31:01,340
and with reason

12757
03:31:01,340 --> 03:31:02,000
for Charlotte

12758
03:31:02,000 --> 03:31:02,300
had been

12759
03:31:02,300 --> 03:31:03,500
tolerably encouraging.

12760
03:31:03,740 --> 03:31:04,020
He was

12761
03:31:04,020 --> 03:31:05,220
comparatively diffident

12762
03:31:05,220 --> 03:31:06,020
since the adventure

12763
03:31:06,020 --> 03:31:07,140
of Wednesday.

12764
03:31:07,140 --> 03:31:08,280
His reception, however,

12765
03:31:08,280 --> 03:31:08,900
was of the most

12766
03:31:08,900 --> 03:31:10,100
flattering kind.

12767
03:31:10,320 --> 03:31:10,980
Miss Lucas.

12768
03:31:10,980 --> 03:31:11,580
Perceived him

12769
03:31:11,580 --> 03:31:12,440
from an upper window

12770
03:31:12,440 --> 03:31:12,980
as he walked

12771
03:31:12,980 --> 03:31:14,100
towards the house.

12772
03:31:14,100 --> 03:31:14,880
And instantly.

12773
03:31:14,880 --> 03:31:15,860
Set out to meet him

12774
03:31:15,860 --> 03:31:16,800
accidentally

12775
03:31:16,800 --> 03:31:17,780
in the lane.

12776
03:31:17,780 --> 03:31:18,500
But little had

12777
03:31:18,500 --> 03:31:19,280
she dared to hope

12778
03:31:19,280 --> 03:31:20,240
that so much love

12779
03:31:20,240 --> 03:31:20,940
and eloquence

12780
03:31:20,940 --> 03:31:22,140
awaited her there

12781
03:31:22,440 --> 03:31:23,100
in as short

12782
03:31:23,100 --> 03:31:23,720
a time as Mr.

12783
03:31:23,720 --> 03:31:24,360
Collins long

12784
03:31:24,360 --> 03:31:25,560
speeches would allow.

12785
03:31:25,560 --> 03:31:26,460
Everything was settled

12786
03:31:26,460 --> 03:31:26,940
between them

12787
03:31:26,940 --> 03:31:27,120
to the

12788
03:31:27,120 --> 03:31:28,320
satisfaction of both.

12789
03:31:28,520 --> 03:31:29,280
And as they entered

12790
03:31:29,280 --> 03:31:29,960
the house,

12791
03:31:29,960 --> 03:31:30,620
he earnestly

12792
03:31:30,620 --> 03:31:31,200
entreated her

12793
03:31:31,200 --> 03:31:31,880
to name the day

12794
03:31:31,880 --> 03:31:32,520
that was to make him

12795
03:31:32,520 --> 03:31:33,720
the happiest men.

12796
03:31:33,980 --> 03:31:34,460
And though

12797
03:31:34,460 --> 03:31:35,420
such a solicitation

12798
03:31:35,420 --> 03:31:36,080
must be way

12799
03:31:36,080 --> 03:31:36,980
for the present,

12800
03:31:36,980 --> 03:31:37,680
the lady felt

12801
03:31:37,680 --> 03:31:38,900
no inclination to trifle

12802
03:31:38,900 --> 03:31:40,080
with his happiness.

12803
03:31:40,080 --> 03:31:40,920
The stupidity

12804
03:31:40,920 --> 03:31:41,300
with which

12805
03:31:41,300 --> 03:31:42,540
he was favored by nature

12806
03:31:42,740 --> 03:31:44,060
must guard his courtship

12807
03:31:44,060 --> 03:31:44,840
from any charm

12808
03:31:44,840 --> 03:31:45,560
that could make a woman

12809
03:31:45,560 --> 03:31:45,960
wish for

12810
03:31:45,960 --> 03:31:47,160
its continuance.

12811
03:31:47,180 --> 03:31:48,320
And Miss Lucas,

12812
03:31:48,320 --> 03:31:49,080
who accepted him.

12813
03:31:49,080 --> 03:31:50,000
Solely from the pure

12814
03:31:50,000 --> 03:31:51,020
and disinterested desire

12815
03:31:51,020 --> 03:31:52,220
of an establishment,

12816
03:31:52,260 --> 03:31:53,480
cared not how soon

12817
03:31:53,480 --> 03:31:54,260
that establishment

12818
03:31:54,260 --> 03:31:55,400
were gained.

12819
03:31:55,400 --> 03:31:56,580
Sir William and Lady

12820
03:31:56,580 --> 03:31:57,560
Lucas were speedily

12821
03:31:57,560 --> 03:31:58,200
applied to

12822
03:31:58,200 --> 03:31:59,280
for their consent.

12823
03:31:59,280 --> 03:31:59,580
And it.

12824
03:31:59,580 --> 03:32:00,240
Was bestowed

12825
03:32:00,240 --> 03:32:00,720
with the most

12826
03:32:00,720 --> 03:32:02,040
joyful alacrity.

12827
03:32:02,420 --> 03:32:03,240
Mr.

12828
03:32:03,240 --> 03:32:04,380
Present circumstances

12829
03:32:04,380 --> 03:32:05,460
made it a most eligible

12830
03:32:05,460 --> 03:32:05,840
match

12831
03:32:05,840 --> 03:32:06,720
for their daughter,

12832
03:32:06,720 --> 03:32:07,100
to whom

12833
03:32:07,100 --> 03:32:07,380
they could

12834
03:32:07,380 --> 03:32:08,580
give little fortune,

12835
03:32:08,580 --> 03:32:09,560
and his prospects

12836
03:32:09,560 --> 03:32:10,320
of future wealth

12837
03:32:10,320 --> 03:32:11,520
were exceedingly fair.

12838
03:32:11,940 --> 03:32:13,140
Lady Lucas began

12839
03:32:13,140 --> 03:32:14,340
directly to calculate

12840
03:32:14,460 --> 03:32:15,440
with more interest

12841
03:32:15,440 --> 03:32:16,040
than the matter

12842
03:32:16,040 --> 03:32:17,240
had ever excited before.

12843
03:32:17,480 --> 03:32:18,240
How many years

12844
03:32:18,240 --> 03:32:18,860
longer Mr.

12845
03:32:18,860 --> 03:32:19,320
Bennett was

12846
03:32:19,320 --> 03:32:20,360
likely to live.

12847
03:32:20,360 --> 03:32:21,440
And Sir William gave it

12848
03:32:21,440 --> 03:32:22,740
as his decided opinion

12849
03:32:22,940 --> 03:32:23,720
that whenever Mr.

12850
03:32:23,720 --> 03:32:24,320
Collins should be

12851
03:32:24,320 --> 03:32:24,840
in possession

12852
03:32:24,840 --> 03:32:25,280
of the long

12853
03:32:25,280 --> 03:32:26,220
bored estate,

12854
03:32:26,220 --> 03:32:26,580
it would

12855
03:32:26,580 --> 03:32:27,780
be highly expedient

12856
03:32:27,780 --> 03:32:28,160
that both

12857
03:32:28,160 --> 03:32:29,100
he and his wife

12858
03:32:29,100 --> 03:32:29,480
should make

12859
03:32:29,480 --> 03:32:30,240
their appearance

12860
03:32:30,240 --> 03:32:31,440
at St James's.

12861
03:32:31,860 --> 03:32:33,140
The family, in short,

12862
03:32:33,140 --> 03:32:34,440
were properly overjoyed

12863
03:32:34,440 --> 03:32:35,600
on the occasion.

12864
03:32:35,600 --> 03:32:36,500
The younger girls

12865
03:32:36,500 --> 03:32:37,100
formed hopes

12866
03:32:37,100 --> 03:32:38,180
of coming out a year

12867
03:32:38,180 --> 03:32:38,720
or two sooner

12868
03:32:38,720 --> 03:32:39,120
than they might

12869
03:32:39,120 --> 03:32:40,260
otherwise have done,

12870
03:32:40,260 --> 03:32:40,920
and the boys

12871
03:32:40,920 --> 03:32:41,340
were relieved

12872
03:32:41,340 --> 03:32:42,380
from their apprehension.

12873
03:32:42,380 --> 03:32:43,380
Charlotte's dying

12874
03:32:43,380 --> 03:32:44,540
and old maid.

12875
03:32:44,540 --> 03:32:45,540
Charlotte herself

12876
03:32:45,540 --> 03:32:46,800
was tolerably composed.

12877
03:32:47,040 --> 03:32:48,240
She had gained her point

12878
03:32:48,300 --> 03:32:49,460
and had time to consider

12879
03:32:49,460 --> 03:32:50,160
of it.

12880
03:32:50,160 --> 03:32:50,940
Her reflections

12881
03:32:50,940 --> 03:32:51,560
were, in general,

12882
03:32:51,560 --> 03:32:53,160
satisfactory Mr.

12883
03:32:53,160 --> 03:32:53,940
Collins, to be

12884
03:32:53,940 --> 03:32:54,600
sure, was neither

12885
03:32:54,600 --> 03:32:55,880
sensible nor agreeable.

12886
03:32:56,160 --> 03:32:57,540
His society was irksome.

12887
03:32:57,660 --> 03:32:58,500
And his attachment.

12888
03:32:58,500 --> 03:32:58,800
To her

12889
03:32:58,800 --> 03:33:00,000
must be imaginary.

12890
03:33:00,300 --> 03:33:01,400
But still he would.

12891
03:33:01,400 --> 03:33:02,600
Be her husband

12892
03:33:02,780 --> 03:33:03,960
without thinking highly

12893
03:33:03,960 --> 03:33:04,620
either of men

12894
03:33:04,620 --> 03:33:05,700
or matrimony.

12895
03:33:05,700 --> 03:33:06,140
Marriage

12896
03:33:06,140 --> 03:33:06,840
had always been

12897
03:33:06,840 --> 03:33:07,800
her object.

12898
03:33:07,800 --> 03:33:08,180
It was

12899
03:33:08,180 --> 03:33:09,060
the only provision

12900
03:33:09,060 --> 03:33:09,980
for well-educated

12901
03:33:09,980 --> 03:33:10,440
young women

12902
03:33:10,440 --> 03:33:11,580
of small fortune.

12903
03:33:11,580 --> 03:33:12,680
And however,

12904
03:33:12,680 --> 03:33:13,860
of giving happiness

12905
03:33:13,860 --> 03:33:15,000
must be their pleasant

12906
03:33:15,000 --> 03:33:15,780
est preservative

12907
03:33:15,780 --> 03:33:16,980
from want.

12908
03:33:16,980 --> 03:33:17,940
This preservative

12909
03:33:17,940 --> 03:33:19,140
she had now obtained

12910
03:33:19,200 --> 03:33:20,840
and at the age of 27,

12911
03:33:21,000 --> 03:33:21,680
without having

12912
03:33:21,680 --> 03:33:22,880
ever handsome,

12913
03:33:22,980 --> 03:33:23,660
she felt all

12914
03:33:23,660 --> 03:33:24,860
the good luck of it.

12915
03:33:24,900 --> 03:33:25,820
The least agreeable

12916
03:33:25,820 --> 03:33:26,580
circumstance in

12917
03:33:26,580 --> 03:33:27,060
the business

12918
03:33:27,060 --> 03:33:27,900
was the surprise.

12919
03:33:27,900 --> 03:33:28,620
It must occasion

12920
03:33:28,620 --> 03:33:29,820
to Elizabeth Bennet,

12921
03:33:29,900 --> 03:33:30,600
whose friendship

12922
03:33:30,600 --> 03:33:31,860
she valued beyond that

12923
03:33:31,860 --> 03:33:33,060
of any other person.

12924
03:33:33,320 --> 03:33:34,520
Elizabeth would wonder

12925
03:33:34,580 --> 03:33:35,280
and probably

12926
03:33:35,280 --> 03:33:36,260
would blame her.

12927
03:33:36,260 --> 03:33:36,740
And though

12928
03:33:36,740 --> 03:33:37,500
her resolution

12929
03:33:37,500 --> 03:33:38,700
was not to be shaken,

12930
03:33:38,840 --> 03:33:39,440
her feelings

12931
03:33:39,440 --> 03:33:40,280
must be hurt

12932
03:33:40,280 --> 03:33:40,680
by such

12933
03:33:40,680 --> 03:33:41,880
a disapprobation.

12934
03:33:42,080 --> 03:33:43,160
She resolved to give her

12935
03:33:43,160 --> 03:33:44,360
the information herself

12936
03:33:44,600 --> 03:33:45,300
and therefore

12937
03:33:45,300 --> 03:33:46,040
charged Mr.

12938
03:33:46,040 --> 03:33:47,400
Collins when he returned

12939
03:33:47,400 --> 03:33:48,600
to Longboard to dinner

12940
03:33:48,780 --> 03:33:49,220
to drop

12941
03:33:49,220 --> 03:33:49,800
no hint of

12942
03:33:49,800 --> 03:33:50,460
what had passed

12943
03:33:50,460 --> 03:33:51,020
before any of

12944
03:33:51,020 --> 03:33:52,100
the family.

12945
03:33:52,100 --> 03:33:52,820
A promise of

12946
03:33:52,820 --> 03:33:53,940
secrecy was, of course,

12947
03:33:53,940 --> 03:33:55,140
very dutifully given.

12948
03:33:55,200 --> 03:33:56,400
But it could not be kept

12949
03:33:56,400 --> 03:33:56,660
without.

12950
03:33:56,660 --> 03:33:57,740
Difficulty

12951
03:33:57,740 --> 03:33:58,680
for the curiosity,

12952
03:33:58,680 --> 03:33:59,700
excited by his long

12953
03:33:59,700 --> 03:34:01,140
absence, burst forth

12954
03:34:01,140 --> 03:34:01,520
in such

12955
03:34:01,520 --> 03:34:02,720
very direct questions

12956
03:34:02,720 --> 03:34:03,660
on his return

12957
03:34:03,660 --> 03:34:04,340
as required

12958
03:34:04,340 --> 03:34:05,820
some ingenuity to evade.

12959
03:34:06,140 --> 03:34:06,780
And he was at

12960
03:34:06,780 --> 03:34:07,980
the same time exercising

12961
03:34:07,980 --> 03:34:09,180
great self-denial,

12962
03:34:09,360 --> 03:34:10,200
for he was longing

12963
03:34:10,200 --> 03:34:10,800
to publish

12964
03:34:10,800 --> 03:34:12,080
his prosperous love

12965
03:34:12,480 --> 03:34:13,440
as he was to begin

12966
03:34:13,440 --> 03:34:14,000
his journey

12967
03:34:14,000 --> 03:34:15,380
too early on the morrow

12968
03:34:15,380 --> 03:34:15,980
to see any of

12969
03:34:15,980 --> 03:34:16,860
the family.

12970
03:34:16,860 --> 03:34:18,020
The ceremony of Leave

12971
03:34:18,020 --> 03:34:19,020
taking was performed

12972
03:34:19,020 --> 03:34:20,000
when the ladies moved

12973
03:34:20,000 --> 03:34:21,440
for the night, and Mrs.

12974
03:34:21,440 --> 03:34:21,860
Bennett,

12975
03:34:21,860 --> 03:34:22,940
with great politeness

12976
03:34:22,940 --> 03:34:24,380
and cordiality, said

12977
03:34:24,380 --> 03:34:25,380
how happy they should be

12978
03:34:25,380 --> 03:34:25,800
to see him

12979
03:34:25,800 --> 03:34:26,900
at long born again

12980
03:34:26,900 --> 03:34:28,080
whenever his engagements

12981
03:34:28,080 --> 03:34:28,680
might allow him

12982
03:34:28,680 --> 03:34:29,340
to visit them.

12983
03:34:30,620 --> 03:34:31,580
My dear,

12984
03:34:31,580 --> 03:34:32,520
he replied.

12985
03:34:32,520 --> 03:34:33,420
This invitation

12986
03:34:33,420 --> 03:34:34,080
is particularly

12987
03:34:34,080 --> 03:34:35,280
gratifying

12988
03:34:35,460 --> 03:34:36,240
because it is what

12989
03:34:36,240 --> 03:34:36,600
I have been

12990
03:34:36,600 --> 03:34:37,800
hoping to receive,

12991
03:34:38,360 --> 03:34:38,900
and you may be

12992
03:34:38,900 --> 03:34:39,620
very certain

12993
03:34:39,620 --> 03:34:40,260
that I shall avail

12994
03:34:40,260 --> 03:34:40,940
myself of it

12995
03:34:40,940 --> 03:34:42,140
as soon as possible.

12996
03:34:42,440 --> 03:34:42,800
They were

12997
03:34:42,800 --> 03:34:44,400
all astonished, and Mr.

12998
03:34:44,400 --> 03:34:45,020
Bennett, who could

12999
03:34:45,020 --> 03:34:45,960
by no means wish

13000
03:34:45,960 --> 03:34:47,240
for so speedy to return,

13001
03:34:47,420 --> 03:34:48,620
immediately said.

13002
03:34:49,040 --> 03:34:49,560
But is there

13003
03:34:49,560 --> 03:34:50,900
not danger of Lady

13004
03:34:50,900 --> 03:34:51,500
Katherine's

13005
03:34:51,500 --> 03:34:52,680
disapprobation here?

13006
03:34:52,680 --> 03:34:53,540
My good sir,

13007
03:34:53,540 --> 03:34:54,660
you had better neglect

13008
03:34:54,660 --> 03:34:56,120
your relations than run

13009
03:34:56,120 --> 03:34:56,540
the risk

13010
03:34:56,540 --> 03:34:57,180
of offending

13011
03:34:57,180 --> 03:34:58,380
your patroness.

13012
03:34:59,000 --> 03:34:59,900
My dear sir.

13013
03:34:59,900 --> 03:35:01,100
Replied Mr..

13014
03:35:01,380 --> 03:35:02,340
I am particularly

13015
03:35:02,340 --> 03:35:03,380
obliged to you for this

13016
03:35:03,380 --> 03:35:04,580
friendly caution,

13017
03:35:05,180 --> 03:35:05,580
and you may

13018
03:35:05,580 --> 03:35:06,260
depend upon my

13019
03:35:06,260 --> 03:35:07,560
not taking such material

13020
03:35:07,560 --> 03:35:08,000
a step

13021
03:35:08,000 --> 03:35:08,480
without Her

13022
03:35:08,480 --> 03:35:09,680
Ladyship concurrence.

13023
03:35:11,820 --> 03:35:12,440
You cannot be

13024
03:35:12,440 --> 03:35:13,820
too much on your guard.

13025
03:35:14,000 --> 03:35:14,820
Risk anything

13026
03:35:14,820 --> 03:35:15,380
rather than

13027
03:35:15,380 --> 03:35:16,520
her displeasure.

13028
03:35:16,520 --> 03:35:17,220
And if you find

13029
03:35:17,220 --> 03:35:18,420
it likely to be raised

13030
03:35:18,540 --> 03:35:19,280
by your coming

13031
03:35:19,280 --> 03:35:20,060
to us again,

13032
03:35:20,060 --> 03:35:20,940
which I should think

13033
03:35:20,940 --> 03:35:22,200
exceedingly probable.

13034
03:35:22,560 --> 03:35:24,180
Stay quietly at home

13035
03:35:24,180 --> 03:35:25,160
and be satisfied that

13036
03:35:25,160 --> 03:35:25,680
we shall take

13037
03:35:25,680 --> 03:35:26,420
no offense.

13038
03:35:28,160 --> 03:35:28,860
Believe me,

13039
03:35:28,860 --> 03:35:29,780
my dear sir, my

13040
03:35:29,780 --> 03:35:30,500
gratitude is

13041
03:35:30,500 --> 03:35:31,340
warmly excited

13042
03:35:31,340 --> 03:35:32,240
by such affectionate

13043
03:35:32,240 --> 03:35:33,480
attention and depend

13044
03:35:33,480 --> 03:35:34,680
upon it.

13045
03:35:34,920 --> 03:35:35,580
You will speedily

13046
03:35:35,580 --> 03:35:36,300
receive from me

13047
03:35:36,300 --> 03:35:36,720
a letter of

13048
03:35:36,720 --> 03:35:37,920
thanks for this, as well

13049
03:35:37,920 --> 03:35:38,540
as for every other

13050
03:35:38,540 --> 03:35:39,440
mark of your regard

13051
03:35:39,440 --> 03:35:40,080
during my stay

13052
03:35:40,080 --> 03:35:41,280
in Hertfordshire.

13053
03:35:41,760 --> 03:35:43,100
As for my fair cousins,

13054
03:35:43,320 --> 03:35:43,500
though,

13055
03:35:43,500 --> 03:35:44,060
my absence

13056
03:35:44,060 --> 03:35:44,840
may not be long enough

13057
03:35:44,840 --> 03:35:46,040
to render it necessary.

13058
03:35:46,280 --> 03:35:46,800
I shall now

13059
03:35:46,800 --> 03:35:47,480
take the liberty

13060
03:35:47,480 --> 03:35:48,080
of wishing them

13061
03:35:48,080 --> 03:35:49,280
health and happiness,

13062
03:35:50,040 --> 03:35:50,700
not accepting

13063
03:35:50,700 --> 03:35:51,900
my cousin Elizabeth.

13064
03:35:53,600 --> 03:35:54,920
With proper civilities,

13065
03:35:54,920 --> 03:35:55,440
the ladies

13066
03:35:55,440 --> 03:35:56,420
then withdrew,

13067
03:35:56,420 --> 03:35:56,940
all of them

13068
03:35:56,940 --> 03:35:57,920
equally surprised

13069
03:35:57,920 --> 03:35:58,680
that he meditated

13070
03:35:58,680 --> 03:35:59,880
a quick return.

13071
03:35:59,900 --> 03:36:00,260
Mrs.

13072
03:36:00,260 --> 03:36:00,980
Bennett wished to.

13073
03:36:00,980 --> 03:36:01,860
Understand by it

13074
03:36:01,860 --> 03:36:02,300
that he thought

13075
03:36:02,300 --> 03:36:03,240
of Peggy's addresses

13076
03:36:03,240 --> 03:36:03,660
to one of her

13077
03:36:03,660 --> 03:36:04,860
younger girls had

13078
03:36:04,860 --> 03:36:05,280
marry,

13079
03:36:05,280 --> 03:36:05,600
might have

13080
03:36:05,600 --> 03:36:06,140
been prevailed

13081
03:36:06,140 --> 03:36:07,340
on to accept him.

13082
03:36:07,400 --> 03:36:08,580
She rated his abilities

13083
03:36:08,580 --> 03:36:09,140
much higher

13084
03:36:09,140 --> 03:36:10,280
than any of the others.

13085
03:36:10,280 --> 03:36:11,400
There was a solidity

13086
03:36:11,400 --> 03:36:12,260
in his reflections

13087
03:36:12,260 --> 03:36:13,500
which often struck her.

13088
03:36:13,800 --> 03:36:15,020
And though by no means

13089
03:36:15,020 --> 03:36:16,220
as clever as herself,

13090
03:36:16,380 --> 03:36:17,060
she thought that

13091
03:36:17,060 --> 03:36:17,700
if encouraged

13092
03:36:17,700 --> 03:36:18,900
to read and improve

13093
03:36:18,980 --> 03:36:19,320
by such

13094
03:36:19,320 --> 03:36:20,520
an example as hers,

13095
03:36:20,600 --> 03:36:21,680
he might become a very

13096
03:36:21,680 --> 03:36:22,880
agreeable companion.

13097
03:36:23,180 --> 03:36:23,660
But on the

13098
03:36:23,660 --> 03:36:24,660
following morning,

13099
03:36:24,660 --> 03:36:25,880
every hope of this kind

13100
03:36:25,880 --> 03:36:26,900
was done away.

13101
03:36:26,900 --> 03:36:27,900
Miss Lucas called

13102
03:36:27,900 --> 03:36:29,100
soon after

13103
03:36:29,100 --> 03:36:29,460
and in a

13104
03:36:29,460 --> 03:36:30,420
private conference

13105
03:36:30,420 --> 03:36:31,200
with Elizabeth,

13106
03:36:31,200 --> 03:36:32,240
related the event

13107
03:36:32,240 --> 03:36:33,440
of the day before

13108
03:36:33,600 --> 03:36:35,000
the possibility of Mr.

13109
03:36:35,000 --> 03:36:35,480
Collins

13110
03:36:35,480 --> 03:36:36,780
fancying himself in love

13111
03:36:36,780 --> 03:36:37,620
with her friend

13112
03:36:37,620 --> 03:36:38,360
had once occurred

13113
03:36:38,360 --> 03:36:38,960
to Elizabeth

13114
03:36:38,960 --> 03:36:39,660
within the last

13115
03:36:39,660 --> 03:36:40,920
day or two, but

13116
03:36:40,920 --> 03:36:41,580
that Charlotte

13117
03:36:41,580 --> 03:36:42,420
could encourage him

13118
03:36:42,420 --> 03:36:43,220
seemed almost

13119
03:36:43,220 --> 03:36:44,400
as far from possibility

13120
03:36:44,400 --> 03:36:44,780
as she could

13121
03:36:44,780 --> 03:36:45,980
encourage him herself.

13122
03:36:46,100 --> 03:36:47,040
And her astonishment.

13123
03:36:47,040 --> 03:36:47,820
Was consequently.

13124
03:36:47,820 --> 03:36:49,280
So as to overcome

13125
03:36:49,280 --> 03:36:50,220
at the first

13126
03:36:50,220 --> 03:36:50,780
the bounds of

13127
03:36:50,780 --> 03:36:51,720
decorum, and.

13128
03:36:51,720 --> 03:36:52,280
She could not.

13129
03:36:52,280 --> 03:36:53,480
Help crying out.

13130
03:36:53,700 --> 03:36:54,740
Engaged to Mr.

13131
03:36:54,740 --> 03:36:56,040
Collins, My

13132
03:36:56,040 --> 03:36:57,240
dear Charlotte.

13133
03:36:57,300 --> 03:36:58,160
Impossible.

13134
03:36:59,160 --> 03:37:00,240
The steady countenance

13135
03:37:00,240 --> 03:37:00,920
which Miss Lucas

13136
03:37:00,920 --> 03:37:01,500
had commanded

13137
03:37:01,500 --> 03:37:02,700
in telling her story.

13138
03:37:02,700 --> 03:37:03,900
Gave way to a momentary.

13139
03:37:03,900 --> 03:37:04,700
Confusion here

13140
03:37:04,700 --> 03:37:05,240
on receiving

13141
03:37:05,240 --> 03:37:06,440
so direct a reproach,

13142
03:37:06,800 --> 03:37:07,500
though as it was

13143
03:37:07,500 --> 03:37:08,780
no more than expected,

13144
03:37:08,960 --> 03:37:09,420
she soon

13145
03:37:09,420 --> 03:37:10,500
regained her composure

13146
03:37:10,500 --> 03:37:11,700
and calmly replied,

13147
03:37:12,320 --> 03:37:12,920
Why should you

13148
03:37:12,920 --> 03:37:13,640
be surprised,

13149
03:37:13,640 --> 03:37:14,840
my dear Eliza?

13150
03:37:14,940 --> 03:37:15,360
Do you think

13151
03:37:15,360 --> 03:37:15,960
it incredible.

13152
03:37:15,960 --> 03:37:16,280
That Mr.

13153
03:37:16,280 --> 03:37:17,040
Collins should be able

13154
03:37:17,040 --> 03:37:17,420
to procure.

13155
03:37:17,420 --> 03:37:17,900
Any woman's

13156
03:37:17,900 --> 03:37:18,720
good opinion?

13157
03:37:18,720 --> 03:37:19,380
Because he was not.

13158
03:37:19,380 --> 03:37:19,860
So happy

13159
03:37:19,860 --> 03:37:21,060
as to succeed with you.

13160
03:37:21,900 --> 03:37:22,680
But Elizabeth had

13161
03:37:22,680 --> 03:37:23,880
now recollected herself

13162
03:37:24,060 --> 03:37:24,560
had making a

13163
03:37:24,560 --> 03:37:25,500
strong effort for

13164
03:37:25,500 --> 03:37:26,700
it was able to assure

13165
03:37:26,700 --> 03:37:27,900
with tolerable firmness

13166
03:37:27,900 --> 03:37:28,640
that the prospect

13167
03:37:28,640 --> 03:37:29,460
of their relationship

13168
03:37:29,460 --> 03:37:29,940
was highly

13169
03:37:29,940 --> 03:37:30,960
grateful to her

13170
03:37:30,960 --> 03:37:31,820
and that she wished her

13171
03:37:31,820 --> 03:37:32,760
all imaginable

13172
03:37:32,760 --> 03:37:33,960
happiness.

13173
03:37:34,320 --> 03:37:34,980
I see what

13174
03:37:34,980 --> 03:37:35,880
you were feeling,

13175
03:37:35,880 --> 03:37:37,080
replied Charlotte.

13176
03:37:37,140 --> 03:37:38,500
You must be surprised.

13177
03:37:38,540 --> 03:37:39,740
Very much surprised.

13178
03:37:39,960 --> 03:37:40,940
So lately, as Mr..

13179
03:37:40,940 --> 03:37:41,700
Collins was wishing

13180
03:37:41,700 --> 03:37:42,900
to marry you.

13181
03:37:43,020 --> 03:37:43,680
But when you have had

13182
03:37:43,680 --> 03:37:44,880
time to think it over,

13183
03:37:45,000 --> 03:37:45,540
I hope you'll

13184
03:37:45,540 --> 03:37:46,160
be satisfied

13185
03:37:46,160 --> 03:37:47,360
with what I have done.

13186
03:37:47,640 --> 03:37:48,860
I am not romantic,

13187
03:37:48,900 --> 03:37:49,460
you know.

13188
03:37:49,460 --> 03:37:50,660
I never was.

13189
03:37:50,720 --> 03:37:51,560
I ask only a

13190
03:37:51,560 --> 03:37:52,760
comfortable home.

13191
03:37:52,760 --> 03:37:53,720
And considering Mr.

13192
03:37:53,720 --> 03:37:54,680
Collins character,

13193
03:37:54,680 --> 03:37:55,220
connection

13194
03:37:55,220 --> 03:37:56,420
and situation in life.

13195
03:37:56,640 --> 03:37:57,420
I am convinced.

13196
03:37:57,420 --> 03:37:58,080
That my chance

13197
03:37:58,080 --> 03:37:58,680
of happiness

13198
03:37:58,680 --> 03:37:59,300
with him is as.

13199
03:37:59,300 --> 03:37:59,700
Fair as

13200
03:37:59,700 --> 03:38:00,680
most people can boast

13201
03:38:00,680 --> 03:38:01,280
on entering.

13202
03:38:01,280 --> 03:38:02,160
The marriage state.

13203
03:38:03,200 --> 03:38:03,780
Elizabeth

13204
03:38:03,780 --> 03:38:04,980
quietly answered.

13205
03:38:05,220 --> 03:38:06,420
Undoubtedly.

13206
03:38:06,620 --> 03:38:07,160
And after

13207
03:38:07,160 --> 03:38:08,360
an awkward pause,

13208
03:38:08,400 --> 03:38:09,080
they returned

13209
03:38:09,080 --> 03:38:09,600
to the rest

13210
03:38:09,600 --> 03:38:10,800
of the family.

13211
03:38:10,860 --> 03:38:11,280
Charlotte

13212
03:38:11,280 --> 03:38:11,840
did not stay

13213
03:38:11,840 --> 03:38:12,680
much longer,

13214
03:38:12,680 --> 03:38:13,500
and Elizabeth was

13215
03:38:13,500 --> 03:38:14,520
then left to reflect

13216
03:38:14,520 --> 03:38:15,720
on what she had heard.

13217
03:38:15,740 --> 03:38:16,940
It was a long time

13218
03:38:16,940 --> 03:38:17,700
before she became

13219
03:38:17,700 --> 03:38:18,020
at all

13220
03:38:18,020 --> 03:38:19,220
reconciled to the idea

13221
03:38:19,220 --> 03:38:20,240
of so unsuitable

13222
03:38:20,240 --> 03:38:21,180
a match.

13223
03:38:21,180 --> 03:38:22,280
The strangeness of Mr.

13224
03:38:22,280 --> 03:38:22,700
Collins

13225
03:38:22,700 --> 03:38:23,640
making two offers

13226
03:38:23,640 --> 03:38:24,080
of marriage

13227
03:38:24,080 --> 03:38:24,980
within three days

13228
03:38:24,980 --> 03:38:25,620
was nothing

13229
03:38:25,620 --> 03:38:26,300
in comparison

13230
03:38:26,300 --> 03:38:26,580
of his

13231
03:38:26,580 --> 03:38:27,800
being now accepted.

13232
03:38:28,320 --> 03:38:28,940
She had always.

13233
03:38:28,940 --> 03:38:29,340
Felt that

13234
03:38:29,340 --> 03:38:30,060
Charlotte's opinion.

13235
03:38:30,060 --> 03:38:30,980
Of matrimony was not.

13236
03:38:30,980 --> 03:38:32,180
Exactly like her own.

13237
03:38:32,360 --> 03:38:32,940
But she had not

13238
03:38:32,940 --> 03:38:33,480
supposed it.

13239
03:38:33,480 --> 03:38:34,220
To be possible

13240
03:38:34,220 --> 03:38:35,280
that when called

13241
03:38:35,280 --> 03:38:36,200
into action,

13242
03:38:36,200 --> 03:38:37,220
she have sacrificed

13243
03:38:37,220 --> 03:38:37,880
every better

13244
03:38:37,880 --> 03:38:38,460
feeling to

13245
03:38:38,460 --> 03:38:39,680
worldly advantage.

13246
03:38:40,140 --> 03:38:40,760
Charlotte,

13247
03:38:40,760 --> 03:38:41,580
the wife of Mr.

13248
03:38:41,580 --> 03:38:42,140
Collins, was

13249
03:38:42,140 --> 03:38:42,440
the most

13250
03:38:42,440 --> 03:38:43,800
humiliating picture

13251
03:38:44,340 --> 03:38:45,180
and the paying

13252
03:38:45,180 --> 03:38:45,680
of a friend.

13253
03:38:45,680 --> 03:38:46,700
Disgracing

13254
03:38:46,700 --> 03:38:47,400
and sunk in her.

13255
03:38:47,400 --> 03:38:48,620
Esteem was added.

13256
03:38:48,620 --> 03:38:49,220
The distressing

13257
03:38:49,220 --> 03:38:49,760
conviction

13258
03:38:49,760 --> 03:38:50,660
that it was impossible

13259
03:38:50,660 --> 03:38:51,620
for that friend

13260
03:38:51,620 --> 03:38:52,400
to be tolerably

13261
03:38:52,400 --> 03:38:53,460
happy and the law

13262
03:38:53,460 --> 03:38:54,360
she had chosen.

13263
03:38:56,420 --> 03:38:57,620
Chapter 23.

13264
03:38:58,880 --> 03:38:59,540
Elizabeth was

13265
03:38:59,540 --> 03:39:00,020
sitting with her

13266
03:39:00,020 --> 03:39:01,100
mother and sisters,

13267
03:39:01,100 --> 03:39:01,820
reflecting on

13268
03:39:01,820 --> 03:39:02,240
what she had

13269
03:39:02,240 --> 03:39:03,500
heard and doubting

13270
03:39:03,500 --> 03:39:03,960
whether she

13271
03:39:03,960 --> 03:39:04,760
was authorized

13272
03:39:04,760 --> 03:39:05,720
to mention it.

13273
03:39:05,720 --> 03:39:06,500
When Sir William

13274
03:39:06,500 --> 03:39:07,700
Lucas himself appeared

13275
03:39:07,820 --> 03:39:09,020
sent by his daughter

13276
03:39:09,120 --> 03:39:09,680
to announce

13277
03:39:09,680 --> 03:39:10,340
her engagement

13278
03:39:10,340 --> 03:39:11,420
to the family.

13279
03:39:11,420 --> 03:39:11,660
With.

13280
03:39:11,660 --> 03:39:12,900
Many compliments to them

13281
03:39:13,040 --> 03:39:13,580
and much

13282
03:39:13,580 --> 03:39:14,480
self-flagellation

13283
03:39:14,480 --> 03:39:15,140
and the prospect

13284
03:39:15,140 --> 03:39:15,780
of a connection

13285
03:39:15,780 --> 03:39:16,860
between the houses,

13286
03:39:16,860 --> 03:39:18,140
he unfolded the matter

13287
03:39:18,320 --> 03:39:19,160
to an audience

13288
03:39:19,160 --> 03:39:20,420
not merely wondering,

13289
03:39:20,420 --> 03:39:21,620
but incredulous.

13290
03:39:21,920 --> 03:39:22,400
For Mrs.

13291
03:39:22,400 --> 03:39:22,920
Bennett,

13292
03:39:22,920 --> 03:39:24,080
with more perseverance

13293
03:39:24,080 --> 03:39:25,100
than politeness,

13294
03:39:25,100 --> 03:39:25,620
protested

13295
03:39:25,620 --> 03:39:26,100
he must be

13296
03:39:26,100 --> 03:39:27,300
entirely mistaken.

13297
03:39:27,600 --> 03:39:28,920
And Lydia, always

13298
03:39:28,920 --> 03:39:29,480
unguarded

13299
03:39:29,480 --> 03:39:30,620
and often uncivil,

13300
03:39:30,620 --> 03:39:31,820
boisterously exclaimed.

13301
03:39:32,220 --> 03:39:33,140
Good Lord.

13302
03:39:33,140 --> 03:39:33,800
So, William,

13303
03:39:33,800 --> 03:39:34,420
how can you tell

13304
03:39:34,420 --> 03:39:35,180
such a story?

13305
03:39:35,180 --> 03:39:36,120
Do not you know that Mr.

13306
03:39:36,120 --> 03:39:36,780
Collins wants to

13307
03:39:36,780 --> 03:39:37,980
marry Lizzie?

13308
03:39:38,280 --> 03:39:38,960
Nothing less

13309
03:39:38,960 --> 03:39:39,180
than the

13310
03:39:39,180 --> 03:39:39,860
complacence of

13311
03:39:39,860 --> 03:39:40,400
a courtier

13312
03:39:40,400 --> 03:39:40,920
could have born

13313
03:39:40,920 --> 03:39:41,540
without anger.

13314
03:39:41,540 --> 03:39:42,560
Such treatment.

13315
03:39:42,560 --> 03:39:43,380
But Sir William's

13316
03:39:43,380 --> 03:39:43,980
good breeding

13317
03:39:43,980 --> 03:39:44,420
carried him

13318
03:39:44,420 --> 03:39:45,240
through at all.

13319
03:39:45,240 --> 03:39:46,100
And though he begged

13320
03:39:46,100 --> 03:39:47,100
leave to be positive

13321
03:39:47,100 --> 03:39:47,700
as to the truth

13322
03:39:47,700 --> 03:39:48,740
of his information,

13323
03:39:48,740 --> 03:39:49,580
he listened to all

13324
03:39:49,580 --> 03:39:50,300
their impertinence

13325
03:39:50,300 --> 03:39:51,320
with the most forbearing

13326
03:39:51,320 --> 03:39:52,520
courtesy.

13327
03:39:52,740 --> 03:39:53,400
Elizabeth

13328
03:39:53,400 --> 03:39:53,880
feeling it

13329
03:39:53,880 --> 03:39:54,660
incumbent on her

13330
03:39:54,660 --> 03:39:55,280
to relieve him

13331
03:39:55,280 --> 03:39:56,160
from so unpleasant

13332
03:39:56,160 --> 03:39:57,140
a situation.

13333
03:39:57,140 --> 03:39:57,480
Now.

13334
03:39:57,480 --> 03:39:58,320
Put herself forward

13335
03:39:58,320 --> 03:39:59,520
to confirm his account

13336
03:39:59,580 --> 03:40:00,720
by mentioning her prior

13337
03:40:00,720 --> 03:40:01,460
knowledge of it

13338
03:40:01,460 --> 03:40:02,660
from Charlotte herself.

13339
03:40:02,760 --> 03:40:03,000
And.

13340
03:40:03,000 --> 03:40:04,040
Endeavored to put a stop

13341
03:40:04,040 --> 03:40:04,940
to the exclamations

13342
03:40:04,940 --> 03:40:05,400
of her mother

13343
03:40:05,400 --> 03:40:06,180
and sisters

13344
03:40:06,180 --> 03:40:07,040
by the earnestness

13345
03:40:07,040 --> 03:40:08,040
of her Congratulations

13346
03:40:08,040 --> 03:40:09,320
to Sir William, in which

13347
03:40:09,320 --> 03:40:09,920
she was readily

13348
03:40:09,920 --> 03:40:11,100
joined by Jane

13349
03:40:11,100 --> 03:40:12,200
and by making a variety

13350
03:40:12,200 --> 03:40:12,720
of remarks

13351
03:40:12,720 --> 03:40:13,400
on the happiness

13352
03:40:13,400 --> 03:40:14,240
that might be expected

13353
03:40:14,240 --> 03:40:15,080
from the Match.

13354
03:40:15,080 --> 03:40:16,160
The excellent character

13355
03:40:16,160 --> 03:40:16,500
of Mr.

13356
03:40:16,500 --> 03:40:17,180
Collins

13357
03:40:17,180 --> 03:40:18,000
and the convenient

13358
03:40:18,000 --> 03:40:19,100
distance of HUNTSBERRY

13359
03:40:19,100 --> 03:40:20,220
from London.

13360
03:40:20,220 --> 03:40:20,580
Mrs.

13361
03:40:20,580 --> 03:40:21,480
Bennett was in fact,

13362
03:40:21,480 --> 03:40:22,100
too much over

13363
03:40:22,100 --> 03:40:22,800
power to say

13364
03:40:22,800 --> 03:40:23,400
a great deal

13365
03:40:23,400 --> 03:40:23,720
while Sir

13366
03:40:23,720 --> 03:40:24,680
William remained.

13367
03:40:24,680 --> 03:40:25,340
But no sooner.

13368
03:40:25,340 --> 03:40:26,460
Had he left them

13369
03:40:26,460 --> 03:40:27,260
than her feelings

13370
03:40:27,260 --> 03:40:28,460
found a rapid vent.

13371
03:40:28,620 --> 03:40:29,820
In the first place,

13372
03:40:29,820 --> 03:40:30,560
she persisted

13373
03:40:30,560 --> 03:40:31,260
in disbelieving

13374
03:40:31,260 --> 03:40:32,460
the whole of the matter.

13375
03:40:32,720 --> 03:40:33,320
Secondly,

13376
03:40:33,320 --> 03:40:34,160
she was very sure

13377
03:40:34,160 --> 03:40:34,520
that Mr.

13378
03:40:34,520 --> 03:40:34,920
Collins

13379
03:40:34,920 --> 03:40:36,080
had been taken in.

13380
03:40:36,080 --> 03:40:36,720
Thirdly,

13381
03:40:36,720 --> 03:40:37,460
she trusted that

13382
03:40:37,460 --> 03:40:38,060
they would never be

13383
03:40:38,060 --> 03:40:39,120
happy together.

13384
03:40:39,120 --> 03:40:39,980
And fourthly,

13385
03:40:39,980 --> 03:40:40,580
that the match

13386
03:40:40,580 --> 03:40:42,260
might be broken off to.

13387
03:40:42,260 --> 03:40:42,920
Inferences,

13388
03:40:42,920 --> 03:40:43,380
however, were

13389
03:40:43,380 --> 03:40:44,240
plainly deduced

13390
03:40:44,240 --> 03:40:45,720
from the whole one

13391
03:40:45,720 --> 03:40:46,440
that Elizabeth

13392
03:40:46,440 --> 03:40:47,400
was the real cause

13393
03:40:47,400 --> 03:40:48,240
of the mischief

13394
03:40:48,240 --> 03:40:48,900
and the other

13395
03:40:48,900 --> 03:40:49,680
that she herself

13396
03:40:49,680 --> 03:40:50,320
had been barbarous,

13397
03:40:50,320 --> 03:40:51,060
only misused

13398
03:40:51,060 --> 03:40:51,920
by them all.

13399
03:40:51,920 --> 03:40:52,740
And on these two.

13400
03:40:52,740 --> 03:40:53,040
Points,

13401
03:40:53,040 --> 03:40:54,140
she principally dwelt

13402
03:40:54,140 --> 03:40:54,720
during the rest

13403
03:40:54,720 --> 03:40:55,760
of the day.

13404
03:40:55,760 --> 03:40:56,940
Nothing could console

13405
03:40:56,940 --> 03:40:57,680
and nothing could

13406
03:40:57,680 --> 03:40:58,640
appease her.

13407
03:40:58,640 --> 03:41:00,020
Nor did that day

13408
03:41:00,020 --> 03:41:01,220
wear out her resentment.

13409
03:41:01,440 --> 03:41:02,400
A week elapsed

13410
03:41:02,400 --> 03:41:02,700
before

13411
03:41:02,700 --> 03:41:03,620
she could see Elizabeth

13412
03:41:03,620 --> 03:41:04,820
without her.

13413
03:41:04,880 --> 03:41:06,020
A month passed away

13414
03:41:06,020 --> 03:41:06,800
before she could speak

13415
03:41:06,800 --> 03:41:07,460
to Sir William

13416
03:41:07,460 --> 03:41:08,220
or Lady Lucas

13417
03:41:08,220 --> 03:41:09,420
without being rude.

13418
03:41:09,440 --> 03:41:10,140
And many months

13419
03:41:10,140 --> 03:41:10,880
were gone before

13420
03:41:10,880 --> 03:41:11,360
she could at all

13421
03:41:11,360 --> 03:41:12,560
forgive their daughter.

13422
03:41:13,100 --> 03:41:13,460
Mr.

13423
03:41:13,460 --> 03:41:14,280
Bennett, emotions

13424
03:41:14,280 --> 03:41:15,360
were much more tranquil

13425
03:41:15,360 --> 03:41:16,340
on the occasion,

13426
03:41:16,340 --> 03:41:17,040
and such as he

13427
03:41:17,040 --> 03:41:17,880
did experience,

13428
03:41:17,880 --> 03:41:18,600
he pronounced to be

13429
03:41:18,600 --> 03:41:19,880
of a most agreeable sort

13430
03:41:20,160 --> 03:41:20,420
for it.

13431
03:41:20,420 --> 03:41:21,200
Gratified him,

13432
03:41:21,200 --> 03:41:21,800
he said,

13433
03:41:21,800 --> 03:41:22,560
to discover that

13434
03:41:22,560 --> 03:41:23,780
Charlotte Lucas, whom

13435
03:41:23,780 --> 03:41:24,380
he had been used

13436
03:41:24,380 --> 03:41:24,680
to think

13437
03:41:24,680 --> 03:41:26,180
tolerably sensible, was.

13438
03:41:26,180 --> 03:41:26,700
As foolish

13439
03:41:26,700 --> 03:41:27,740
as his wife and.

13440
03:41:27,740 --> 03:41:28,400
More foolish

13441
03:41:28,400 --> 03:41:29,600
than his daughter.

13442
03:41:30,020 --> 03:41:31,140
Jane confessed herself

13443
03:41:31,140 --> 03:41:31,940
a little surprised

13444
03:41:31,940 --> 03:41:32,660
at the match.

13445
03:41:32,660 --> 03:41:33,540
But she said

13446
03:41:33,540 --> 03:41:34,320
of her astonishment

13447
03:41:34,320 --> 03:41:34,680
than of her

13448
03:41:34,680 --> 03:41:35,300
earnest desire

13449
03:41:35,300 --> 03:41:36,480
for their happiness.

13450
03:41:36,480 --> 03:41:37,340
Nor can Elizabeth

13451
03:41:37,340 --> 03:41:37,840
persuade her

13452
03:41:37,840 --> 03:41:38,460
to consider it

13453
03:41:38,460 --> 03:41:39,660
as improbable.

13454
03:41:39,720 --> 03:41:40,640
Kitty and Lydia

13455
03:41:40,640 --> 03:41:41,640
were far from envying

13456
03:41:41,640 --> 03:41:42,440
Miss Lucas.

13457
03:41:42,440 --> 03:41:42,860
For Mr.

13458
03:41:42,860 --> 03:41:43,500
Collins,

13459
03:41:43,500 --> 03:41:44,580
only a clergyman.

13460
03:41:44,580 --> 03:41:45,600
And it affected them in

13461
03:41:45,600 --> 03:41:46,220
no other way

13462
03:41:46,220 --> 03:41:46,860
than as a piece of

13463
03:41:46,860 --> 03:41:47,660
news to spread

13464
03:41:47,660 --> 03:41:48,360
at Meriton.

13465
03:41:49,320 --> 03:41:50,120
Lady Lucas could

13466
03:41:50,120 --> 03:41:51,060
not be insensible.

13467
03:41:51,060 --> 03:41:51,660
Of triumph

13468
03:41:51,660 --> 03:41:52,260
on being able

13469
03:41:52,260 --> 03:41:53,240
to retort on Mrs.

13470
03:41:53,240 --> 03:41:53,520
Bennett

13471
03:41:53,520 --> 03:41:54,120
the comfort of

13472
03:41:54,120 --> 03:41:54,740
having a daughter

13473
03:41:54,740 --> 03:41:55,700
while married,

13474
03:41:55,700 --> 03:41:56,400
and she called it

13475
03:41:56,400 --> 03:41:56,940
long born

13476
03:41:56,940 --> 03:41:57,780
rather oftener

13477
03:41:57,780 --> 03:41:58,380
than usual.

13478
03:41:58,380 --> 03:41:58,680
To say

13479
03:41:58,680 --> 03:41:59,880
how happy she was.

13480
03:41:59,940 --> 03:42:00,480
Though Mrs.

13481
03:42:00,480 --> 03:42:00,840
Bennett's.

13482
03:42:00,840 --> 03:42:01,620
Sour looks

13483
03:42:01,620 --> 03:42:02,880
and ill natured remarks

13484
03:42:03,080 --> 03:42:03,660
have been enough

13485
03:42:03,660 --> 03:42:05,160
to drive happiness away

13486
03:42:05,780 --> 03:42:06,680
between Elizabeth

13487
03:42:06,680 --> 03:42:07,380
and Charlotte,

13488
03:42:07,380 --> 03:42:08,340
there was restraint

13489
03:42:08,340 --> 03:42:08,940
which kept them

13490
03:42:08,940 --> 03:42:09,920
mutually silent

13491
03:42:09,920 --> 03:42:11,040
on the subject.

13492
03:42:11,040 --> 03:42:12,000
And Elizabeth felt

13493
03:42:12,000 --> 03:42:13,260
persuaded that no real

13494
03:42:13,260 --> 03:42:13,860
confidence

13495
03:42:13,860 --> 03:42:14,780
could ever subsist

13496
03:42:14,780 --> 03:42:15,980
between them again.

13497
03:42:16,140 --> 03:42:16,940
Her disappointment

13498
03:42:16,940 --> 03:42:17,520
in Charlotte

13499
03:42:17,520 --> 03:42:18,080
made her turn

13500
03:42:18,080 --> 03:42:18,620
with fonder

13501
03:42:18,620 --> 03:42:19,820
regard to her sister,

13502
03:42:20,060 --> 03:42:21,140
of whose rectitude

13503
03:42:21,140 --> 03:42:21,920
and delicacy

13504
03:42:21,920 --> 03:42:22,700
she was sure

13505
03:42:22,700 --> 03:42:23,180
opinion could

13506
03:42:23,180 --> 03:42:24,360
never be shaken

13507
03:42:24,360 --> 03:42:25,400
and for whose happiness

13508
03:42:25,400 --> 03:42:25,740
she carried

13509
03:42:25,740 --> 03:42:26,940
daily more anxious

13510
03:42:27,060 --> 03:42:27,660
as Bingley

13511
03:42:27,660 --> 03:42:28,860
had now been gone a week

13512
03:42:28,980 --> 03:42:29,480
and nothing

13513
03:42:29,480 --> 03:42:30,180
more was heard

13514
03:42:30,180 --> 03:42:31,380
of his return.

13515
03:42:31,680 --> 03:42:33,020
Jane had Caroline

13516
03:42:33,020 --> 03:42:33,440
an early

13517
03:42:33,440 --> 03:42:34,640
answer to her letter

13518
03:42:34,700 --> 03:42:35,460
and was counting

13519
03:42:35,460 --> 03:42:35,900
the days

13520
03:42:35,900 --> 03:42:36,420
till she might

13521
03:42:36,420 --> 03:42:37,160
reasonably hope

13522
03:42:37,160 --> 03:42:38,340
to hear again.

13523
03:42:38,340 --> 03:42:39,320
The promised letter of

13524
03:42:39,320 --> 03:42:39,760
Thanks for.

13525
03:42:39,760 --> 03:42:40,020
Mr.

13526
03:42:40,020 --> 03:42:40,500
Collins

13527
03:42:40,500 --> 03:42:41,720
arrived on Tuesday,

13528
03:42:41,900 --> 03:42:42,440
addressed to

13529
03:42:42,440 --> 03:42:43,740
their father and written

13530
03:42:43,740 --> 03:42:44,180
with all the

13531
03:42:44,180 --> 03:42:45,420
solemnity of gratitude

13532
03:42:45,420 --> 03:42:46,220
which a 12 months

13533
03:42:46,220 --> 03:42:47,160
abode in the family

13534
03:42:47,160 --> 03:42:48,360
might have prompted.

13535
03:42:48,500 --> 03:42:49,400
After discharging

13536
03:42:49,400 --> 03:42:50,040
his conscience

13537
03:42:50,040 --> 03:42:50,840
on that head,

13538
03:42:50,840 --> 03:42:51,420
he proceeded

13539
03:42:51,420 --> 03:42:52,800
to inform them with many

13540
03:42:52,800 --> 03:42:54,000
rapturous expressions

13541
03:42:54,180 --> 03:42:55,020
of his happiness

13542
03:42:55,020 --> 03:42:55,740
and having obtained

13543
03:42:55,740 --> 03:42:56,240
the affection

13544
03:42:56,240 --> 03:42:56,960
of their amiable

13545
03:42:56,960 --> 03:42:57,560
neighbor, Ms..

13546
03:42:57,560 --> 03:42:58,200
Lucas,

13547
03:42:58,200 --> 03:42:59,240
and then explained that

13548
03:42:59,240 --> 03:42:59,820
it was merely

13549
03:42:59,820 --> 03:43:00,180
with a view

13550
03:43:00,180 --> 03:43:01,460
of enjoying her society,

13551
03:43:01,700 --> 03:43:02,220
that he had been

13552
03:43:02,220 --> 03:43:03,060
so ready to close

13553
03:43:03,060 --> 03:43:03,860
with their kind wish

13554
03:43:03,860 --> 03:43:04,560
of seeing him again

13555
03:43:04,560 --> 03:43:05,480
at long born.

13556
03:43:05,480 --> 03:43:06,120
Whether he hoped.

13557
03:43:06,120 --> 03:43:06,480
To be able

13558
03:43:06,480 --> 03:43:06,980
to return

13559
03:43:06,980 --> 03:43:08,180
on Monday fortnight.

13560
03:43:08,280 --> 03:43:09,320
For Lady Catherine,

13561
03:43:09,320 --> 03:43:10,020
he added,

13562
03:43:10,020 --> 03:43:11,100
so heartily approved

13563
03:43:11,100 --> 03:43:11,880
his marriage

13564
03:43:11,880 --> 03:43:12,620
that she wished it

13565
03:43:12,620 --> 03:43:13,260
to take place

13566
03:43:13,260 --> 03:43:14,220
as soon as possible.

13567
03:43:14,220 --> 03:43:14,540
Which.

13568
03:43:14,540 --> 03:43:15,180
He trusted

13569
03:43:15,180 --> 03:43:15,420
would be

13570
03:43:15,420 --> 03:43:16,680
an unanswerable argument

13571
03:43:16,680 --> 03:43:17,300
with his amiable

13572
03:43:17,300 --> 03:43:17,940
Charlotte,

13573
03:43:17,940 --> 03:43:18,960
to name an early day

13574
03:43:18,960 --> 03:43:19,500
for making him

13575
03:43:19,500 --> 03:43:20,760
the happiest of men.

13576
03:43:21,780 --> 03:43:22,140
Mr.

13577
03:43:22,140 --> 03:43:23,100
Collins returned

13578
03:43:23,100 --> 03:43:23,760
to Hertfordshire,

13579
03:43:23,760 --> 03:43:24,540
was no longer

13580
03:43:24,540 --> 03:43:25,440
a matter of pleasure

13581
03:43:25,440 --> 03:43:26,600
to Mrs. Bennett.

13582
03:43:26,600 --> 03:43:27,740
On the contrary,

13583
03:43:27,740 --> 03:43:28,980
she was as much disposed

13584
03:43:28,980 --> 03:43:29,780
to complain of it

13585
03:43:29,780 --> 03:43:30,980
as her husband.

13586
03:43:31,040 --> 03:43:31,460
It was.

13587
03:43:31,460 --> 03:43:32,280
Very strange

13588
03:43:32,280 --> 03:43:32,780
that he should come

13589
03:43:32,780 --> 03:43:33,440
too long born

13590
03:43:33,440 --> 03:43:34,260
instead of the Lucas.

13591
03:43:34,260 --> 03:43:34,980
Lodge.

13592
03:43:34,980 --> 03:43:35,880
It was also

13593
03:43:35,880 --> 03:43:37,080
very inconvenient

13594
03:43:37,160 --> 03:43:38,000
and exceedingly

13595
03:43:38,000 --> 03:43:39,000
troublesome.

13596
03:43:39,000 --> 03:43:39,900
She hated having

13597
03:43:39,900 --> 03:43:40,760
visitors in the house

13598
03:43:40,760 --> 03:43:41,280
while her health

13599
03:43:41,280 --> 03:43:42,480
was so indifferent.

13600
03:43:42,500 --> 03:43:43,160
Had lovers

13601
03:43:43,160 --> 03:43:43,980
were of all people

13602
03:43:43,980 --> 03:43:45,300
the most disagreeable.

13603
03:43:45,680 --> 03:43:46,520
Such were the gentle

13604
03:43:46,520 --> 03:43:47,220
murmurs of Mrs.

13605
03:43:47,220 --> 03:43:47,700
Bennett,

13606
03:43:47,700 --> 03:43:48,440
and they gave way

13607
03:43:48,440 --> 03:43:49,100
only to the greater

13608
03:43:49,100 --> 03:43:49,860
distress of Mr.

13609
03:43:49,860 --> 03:43:50,160
Bingley

13610
03:43:50,160 --> 03:43:51,420
his continued absence.

13611
03:43:52,040 --> 03:43:52,860
Neither Jane

13612
03:43:52,860 --> 03:43:53,520
nor Elizabeth

13613
03:43:53,520 --> 03:43:54,140
were comfortable

13614
03:43:54,140 --> 03:43:55,260
on this subject.

13615
03:43:55,260 --> 03:43:56,240
Day after day

13616
03:43:56,240 --> 03:43:56,840
passed away

13617
03:43:56,840 --> 03:43:57,440
without bringing

13618
03:43:57,440 --> 03:43:57,900
any other

13619
03:43:57,900 --> 03:43:58,860
tidings of him.

13620
03:43:58,860 --> 03:43:59,580
Then the report,

13621
03:43:59,580 --> 03:44:00,020
which shortly

13622
03:44:00,020 --> 03:44:00,440
prevailed

13623
03:44:00,440 --> 03:44:00,980
and merited

13624
03:44:00,980 --> 03:44:01,460
of his coming

13625
03:44:01,460 --> 03:44:02,420
no more to Netherfield

13626
03:44:02,420 --> 03:44:03,500
the whole winter.

13627
03:44:03,500 --> 03:44:04,080
A report

13628
03:44:04,080 --> 03:44:04,620
which highly

13629
03:44:04,620 --> 03:44:05,460
incensed Mrs.

13630
03:44:05,460 --> 03:44:06,060
Bennett.

13631
03:44:06,060 --> 03:44:06,440
And which.

13632
03:44:06,440 --> 03:44:07,100
She never failed

13633
03:44:07,100 --> 03:44:07,740
to contradict

13634
03:44:07,740 --> 03:44:08,940
as the most scandalous.

13635
03:44:08,940 --> 03:44:09,920
Falsehood.

13636
03:44:09,920 --> 03:44:10,880
Even Elizabeth

13637
03:44:10,880 --> 03:44:12,320
began to fear not

13638
03:44:12,320 --> 03:44:12,800
that Bingley

13639
03:44:12,800 --> 03:44:13,680
was indifferent,

13640
03:44:13,680 --> 03:44:14,700
but that his sisters

13641
03:44:14,700 --> 03:44:15,440
would be successful

13642
03:44:15,440 --> 03:44:16,640
in keeping him away.

13643
03:44:16,800 --> 03:44:17,960
Unwilling as she was

13644
03:44:17,960 --> 03:44:18,800
to admit, an idea

13645
03:44:18,800 --> 03:44:19,520
so destructive

13646
03:44:19,520 --> 03:44:20,700
of Jane's happiness

13647
03:44:20,700 --> 03:44:21,680
and so dishonorable

13648
03:44:21,680 --> 03:44:21,900
to the

13649
03:44:21,900 --> 03:44:23,100
stability of her lover,

13650
03:44:23,240 --> 03:44:23,820
she could not

13651
03:44:23,820 --> 03:44:24,360
prevent its

13652
03:44:24,360 --> 03:44:25,560
frequently occurring.

13653
03:44:25,620 --> 03:44:26,640
The united efforts

13654
03:44:26,640 --> 03:44:27,140
of his two

13655
03:44:27,140 --> 03:44:28,340
unfeeling sisters

13656
03:44:28,440 --> 03:44:29,660
and of his overpowering

13657
03:44:29,660 --> 03:44:30,800
friend, assisted

13658
03:44:30,800 --> 03:44:31,680
by the attractions

13659
03:44:31,680 --> 03:44:32,420
of Miss Dorothy

13660
03:44:32,420 --> 03:44:32,600
and the

13661
03:44:32,600 --> 03:44:33,800
amusements of London.

13662
03:44:33,860 --> 03:44:34,980
Might be too much.

13663
03:44:34,980 --> 03:44:35,820
She feared

13664
03:44:35,820 --> 03:44:36,560
for the strength

13665
03:44:36,560 --> 03:44:37,760
of his attachment.

13666
03:44:38,160 --> 03:44:39,620
As for Jane, her

13667
03:44:40,280 --> 03:44:41,400
under the suspense was,

13668
03:44:41,400 --> 03:44:41,840
of course,

13669
03:44:41,840 --> 03:44:42,500
more painful

13670
03:44:42,500 --> 03:44:43,500
than Elizabeth's.

13671
03:44:43,500 --> 03:44:44,420
But whatever she felt

13672
03:44:44,420 --> 03:44:44,660
she was

13673
03:44:44,660 --> 03:44:45,900
desirous of concealing.

13674
03:44:46,160 --> 03:44:47,120
And between Elizabeth

13675
03:44:47,120 --> 03:44:48,320
and herself, therefore,

13676
03:44:48,360 --> 03:44:49,100
the subject was

13677
03:44:49,100 --> 03:44:50,300
never alluded to.

13678
03:44:50,540 --> 03:44:51,260
But as no.

13679
03:44:51,260 --> 03:44:52,020
Such delicacy

13680
03:44:52,020 --> 03:44:53,220
restrained her mother

13681
03:44:53,300 --> 03:44:54,660
and our seldom past

13682
03:44:54,660 --> 03:44:55,160
in which she did

13683
03:44:55,160 --> 03:44:56,360
not talk of Bingley

13684
03:44:56,400 --> 03:44:57,660
expressed her impatience

13685
03:44:57,660 --> 03:44:58,580
for his arrival

13686
03:44:58,580 --> 03:44:59,780
or even required

13687
03:44:59,940 --> 03:45:00,600
to confess that

13688
03:45:00,600 --> 03:45:01,640
if he did not come back,

13689
03:45:01,640 --> 03:45:01,920
she would

13690
03:45:01,920 --> 03:45:03,200
think herself very ill.

13691
03:45:03,200 --> 03:45:04,200
Used.

13692
03:45:04,200 --> 03:45:05,060
It needed all

13693
03:45:05,060 --> 03:45:06,420
Jane's steady mildness

13694
03:45:06,420 --> 03:45:06,780
to bear

13695
03:45:06,780 --> 03:45:07,520
these attacks with

13696
03:45:07,520 --> 03:45:08,840
tolerable tranquility.

13697
03:45:09,980 --> 03:45:10,320
Mr.

13698
03:45:10,320 --> 03:45:11,060
Collins returned

13699
03:45:11,060 --> 03:45:11,900
most punctually

13700
03:45:11,900 --> 03:45:13,100
on Monday fortnight,

13701
03:45:13,140 --> 03:45:14,000
but his reception

13702
03:45:14,000 --> 03:45:14,460
at Long

13703
03:45:14,460 --> 03:45:15,260
Bond was not quite

13704
03:45:15,260 --> 03:45:16,520
so gracious as it had

13705
03:45:16,520 --> 03:45:16,940
been on his

13706
03:45:16,940 --> 03:45:18,140
first introduction.

13707
03:45:18,300 --> 03:45:19,500
He was too happy

13708
03:45:19,680 --> 03:45:20,880
to need much attention,

13709
03:45:20,900 --> 03:45:21,480
and luckily

13710
03:45:21,480 --> 03:45:22,080
for the others,

13711
03:45:22,080 --> 03:45:22,520
the business

13712
03:45:22,520 --> 03:45:23,180
of lovemaking

13713
03:45:23,180 --> 03:45:23,740
relieved them

13714
03:45:23,740 --> 03:45:24,180
from a great

13715
03:45:24,180 --> 03:45:25,380
deal of his company.

13716
03:45:25,520 --> 03:45:26,100
The chief of.

13717
03:45:26,100 --> 03:45:26,600
Every day

13718
03:45:26,600 --> 03:45:27,360
was spent by him

13719
03:45:27,360 --> 03:45:28,440
at Lucas Lodge.

13720
03:45:28,440 --> 03:45:29,160
And he sometimes.

13721
03:45:29,160 --> 03:45:30,080
Returned to Long Borne

13722
03:45:30,080 --> 03:45:30,740
only in time

13723
03:45:30,740 --> 03:45:31,560
to make an apology

13724
03:45:31,560 --> 03:45:32,600
for his absence

13725
03:45:32,600 --> 03:45:33,420
before the family

13726
03:45:33,420 --> 03:45:34,340
went to bed.

13727
03:45:34,340 --> 03:45:34,740
Mrs.

13728
03:45:34,740 --> 03:45:35,580
Bennett was really

13729
03:45:35,580 --> 03:45:36,180
in a most

13730
03:45:36,180 --> 03:45:37,380
pitiable state.

13731
03:45:37,500 --> 03:45:38,420
The very mention

13732
03:45:38,420 --> 03:45:39,020
of anything

13733
03:45:39,020 --> 03:45:39,900
concerning the match

13734
03:45:39,900 --> 03:45:40,520
threw her into an

13735
03:45:40,520 --> 03:45:41,720
agony of ill humor,

13736
03:45:42,000 --> 03:45:42,900
and wherever she went,

13737
03:45:42,900 --> 03:45:43,380
she was sure

13738
03:45:43,380 --> 03:45:43,940
of hearing it.

13739
03:45:43,940 --> 03:45:44,880
Talked of.

13740
03:45:44,880 --> 03:45:46,200
The sight of Miss Lucas

13741
03:45:46,200 --> 03:45:46,920
was odious.

13742
03:45:46,920 --> 03:45:48,800
To her as her successor.

13743
03:45:48,920 --> 03:45:49,640
That house.

13744
03:45:49,640 --> 03:45:50,420
She regarded her

13745
03:45:50,420 --> 03:45:51,620
with jealous abhorrence

13746
03:45:51,920 --> 03:45:52,800
whenever Charlotte

13747
03:45:52,800 --> 03:45:53,780
came to see them.

13748
03:45:53,780 --> 03:45:54,660
She concluded her

13749
03:45:54,660 --> 03:45:55,500
to be anticipating

13750
03:45:55,500 --> 03:45:56,700
the hour of possession,

13751
03:45:56,780 --> 03:45:57,260
and whenever

13752
03:45:57,260 --> 03:45:57,780
she spoke

13753
03:45:57,780 --> 03:45:58,820
in a loud voice to Mr.

13754
03:45:58,820 --> 03:45:59,480
Collins.

13755
03:45:59,480 --> 03:46:00,240
Was convinced.

13756
03:46:00,240 --> 03:46:00,960
That they were talking

13757
03:46:00,960 --> 03:46:02,160
of the long born estate

13758
03:46:02,180 --> 03:46:02,820
and resolving

13759
03:46:02,820 --> 03:46:03,660
to turn herself

13760
03:46:03,660 --> 03:46:04,200
and her daughters

13761
03:46:04,200 --> 03:46:04,940
out of the house

13762
03:46:04,940 --> 03:46:05,640
as soon as Mr.

13763
03:46:05,640 --> 03:46:06,780
Bennett were dead.

13764
03:46:06,780 --> 03:46:07,860
She complained bitterly

13765
03:46:07,860 --> 03:46:08,360
of all this

13766
03:46:08,360 --> 03:46:09,560
to her husband.

13767
03:46:09,680 --> 03:46:10,620
Indeed, Mr.

13768
03:46:10,620 --> 03:46:11,820
Bennett said she.

13769
03:46:12,120 --> 03:46:13,220
It is very hard

13770
03:46:13,220 --> 03:46:13,680
to think that

13771
03:46:13,680 --> 03:46:14,640
Charlotte Lucas.

13772
03:46:14,640 --> 03:46:15,080
Should ever

13773
03:46:15,080 --> 03:46:15,660
be mistress of.

13774
03:46:15,660 --> 03:46:16,340
This house

13775
03:46:16,340 --> 03:46:16,880
and that I

13776
03:46:16,880 --> 03:46:17,420
should be forced

13777
03:46:17,420 --> 03:46:18,540
to make way for her

13778
03:46:18,540 --> 03:46:19,340
and live to see her

13779
03:46:19,340 --> 03:46:20,540
take a place in it.

13780
03:46:21,320 --> 03:46:21,920
My dear,

13781
03:46:21,920 --> 03:46:23,240
do not give way to such

13782
03:46:23,240 --> 03:46:24,440
gloomy thoughts.

13783
03:46:24,680 --> 03:46:25,200
That is hope

13784
03:46:25,200 --> 03:46:26,400
for better things.

13785
03:46:26,540 --> 03:46:26,900
Let us

13786
03:46:26,900 --> 03:46:28,100
flatter ourselves that

13787
03:46:28,200 --> 03:46:29,520
may be the survivor.

13788
03:46:30,500 --> 03:46:31,040
This was

13789
03:46:31,040 --> 03:46:31,520
not very

13790
03:46:31,520 --> 03:46:32,420
consoling to Mrs.

13791
03:46:32,420 --> 03:46:33,680
Bennett, and therefore,

13792
03:46:33,680 --> 03:46:34,340
instead of making

13793
03:46:34,340 --> 03:46:35,600
any answer, she went on

13794
03:46:35,600 --> 03:46:36,800
as before.

13795
03:46:36,840 --> 03:46:38,000
I cannot bear to think

13796
03:46:38,000 --> 03:46:38,400
that they should

13797
03:46:38,400 --> 03:46:39,600
have all this estate.

13798
03:46:39,600 --> 03:46:40,140
If it was not

13799
03:46:40,140 --> 03:46:40,860
for the entail,

13800
03:46:40,860 --> 03:46:42,060
I should not mind it.

13801
03:46:42,740 --> 03:46:43,460
What should not you

13802
03:46:43,460 --> 03:46:44,660
mind?

13803
03:46:44,900 --> 03:46:45,740
I should not mind

13804
03:46:45,740 --> 03:46:46,940
anything at all.

13805
03:46:47,060 --> 03:46:48,020
Let us be thankful

13806
03:46:48,020 --> 03:46:49,100
that you are preserved

13807
03:46:49,100 --> 03:46:49,340
from a

13808
03:46:49,340 --> 03:46:49,800
state of

13809
03:46:49,800 --> 03:46:51,480
such insensibility.

13810
03:46:51,900 --> 03:46:52,680
I can never be

13811
03:46:52,680 --> 03:46:53,540
thankful, Mr. Bennett.

13812
03:46:53,540 --> 03:46:54,080
For anything

13813
03:46:54,080 --> 03:46:55,280
about the entail.

13814
03:46:55,340 --> 03:46:56,300
How anyone should have

13815
03:46:56,300 --> 03:46:56,960
the conscience

13816
03:46:56,960 --> 03:46:57,660
to entail away

13817
03:46:57,660 --> 03:46:58,080
in a state

13818
03:46:58,080 --> 03:46:58,620
from one's

13819
03:46:58,620 --> 03:46:59,240
own daughters.

13820
03:46:59,240 --> 03:47:00,440
I can not understand.

13821
03:47:00,740 --> 03:47:01,160
And all

13822
03:47:01,160 --> 03:47:02,180
for the sake of Mr.

13823
03:47:02,180 --> 03:47:03,380
Collins do.

13824
03:47:03,420 --> 03:47:04,560
Why should he have it

13825
03:47:04,560 --> 03:47:05,760
more than anybody else?

13826
03:47:06,440 --> 03:47:07,760
I leave it to yourself

13827
03:47:08,000 --> 03:47:09,200
to determine.

13828
03:47:09,240 --> 03:47:09,720
Said Mr.

13829
03:47:09,720 --> 03:47:10,100
Bennett.

13830
03:47:11,340 --> 03:47:12,600
Chapter 24.

13831
03:47:14,000 --> 03:47:14,760
Miss Bingley

13832
03:47:14,760 --> 03:47:15,680
letter arrived

13833
03:47:15,680 --> 03:47:17,240
and put an end to doubt.

13834
03:47:17,660 --> 03:47:19,140
The very first sentence

13835
03:47:19,140 --> 03:47:20,240
conveyed the assurance

13836
03:47:20,240 --> 03:47:20,600
of their

13837
03:47:20,600 --> 03:47:21,180
being all

13838
03:47:21,180 --> 03:47:22,140
settled in London

13839
03:47:22,140 --> 03:47:23,120
for the winter

13840
03:47:23,120 --> 03:47:24,120
and concluded

13841
03:47:24,120 --> 03:47:24,360
with her

13842
03:47:24,360 --> 03:47:25,200
brother's regret

13843
03:47:25,200 --> 03:47:26,460
at not having had time

13844
03:47:26,460 --> 03:47:26,780
to pay

13845
03:47:26,780 --> 03:47:27,440
his respects

13846
03:47:27,440 --> 03:47:28,080
to his friends

13847
03:47:28,080 --> 03:47:29,180
in Hertfordshire

13848
03:47:29,180 --> 03:47:29,960
before he left

13849
03:47:29,960 --> 03:47:31,160
the country.

13850
03:47:31,320 --> 03:47:32,520
Hope was over,

13851
03:47:32,760 --> 03:47:34,080
entirely over,

13852
03:47:34,400 --> 03:47:35,220
and when Jane

13853
03:47:35,220 --> 03:47:35,820
could attend

13854
03:47:35,820 --> 03:47:36,300
to the rest

13855
03:47:36,300 --> 03:47:37,140
of the letter,

13856
03:47:37,140 --> 03:47:38,340
she found little

13857
03:47:38,360 --> 03:47:39,480
except the professed

13858
03:47:39,480 --> 03:47:40,680
affection of the writer

13859
03:47:40,880 --> 03:47:41,720
that could give her

13860
03:47:41,720 --> 03:47:42,900
any comfort.

13861
03:47:42,900 --> 03:47:43,800
Miss Darcy's

13862
03:47:43,800 --> 03:47:45,080
praise occupied

13863
03:47:45,080 --> 03:47:46,280
the chief of it.

13864
03:47:46,340 --> 03:47:47,640
Her many attractions

13865
03:47:47,640 --> 03:47:48,860
were again dwelt on,

13866
03:47:49,100 --> 03:47:50,520
and Caroline boasted

13867
03:47:50,520 --> 03:47:51,380
joyfully of their

13868
03:47:51,380 --> 03:47:52,640
increasing intimacy

13869
03:47:52,920 --> 03:47:54,180
and venture to predict

13870
03:47:54,180 --> 03:47:55,040
the accomplishment

13871
03:47:55,040 --> 03:47:55,700
of the wishes

13872
03:47:55,700 --> 03:47:56,900
which had been unfolded

13873
03:47:56,900 --> 03:47:58,100
in her former letter.

13874
03:47:58,440 --> 03:47:59,420
She wrote also

13875
03:47:59,420 --> 03:48:00,260
with great pleasure

13876
03:48:00,260 --> 03:48:00,960
of her brother's

13877
03:48:00,960 --> 03:48:02,160
being an intimate of Mr.

13878
03:48:02,160 --> 03:48:03,300
Darcy's house

13879
03:48:03,300 --> 03:48:04,020
and mentioned

13880
03:48:04,020 --> 03:48:04,800
with raptures

13881
03:48:04,800 --> 03:48:06,140
some plans of the latter

13882
03:48:06,140 --> 03:48:06,800
with regard to

13883
03:48:06,800 --> 03:48:07,580
new furniture.

13884
03:48:08,600 --> 03:48:09,980
Elizabeth to whom Jane

13885
03:48:09,980 --> 03:48:11,180
very soon communicated.

13886
03:48:11,180 --> 03:48:12,380
The chief of all this

13887
03:48:12,500 --> 03:48:13,740
heard it in silent

13888
03:48:13,740 --> 03:48:14,940
indignation.

13889
03:48:14,960 --> 03:48:16,260
Her heart was divided

13890
03:48:16,260 --> 03:48:17,180
between, concern

13891
03:48:17,180 --> 03:48:18,140
for her sister

13892
03:48:18,140 --> 03:48:19,140
and resentment

13893
03:48:19,140 --> 03:48:20,440
against all others

13894
03:48:20,940 --> 03:48:21,720
to Caroline's

13895
03:48:21,720 --> 03:48:22,260
assertion of

13896
03:48:22,260 --> 03:48:22,760
her brothers

13897
03:48:22,760 --> 03:48:23,420
being partial

13898
03:48:23,420 --> 03:48:24,480
to Miss Darcy.

13899
03:48:24,480 --> 03:48:26,400
She paid no credit that.

13900
03:48:26,400 --> 03:48:26,660
He was

13901
03:48:26,660 --> 03:48:27,900
really fond of Jane.

13902
03:48:28,100 --> 03:48:28,760
She doubted

13903
03:48:28,760 --> 03:48:29,720
no more than she had

13904
03:48:29,720 --> 03:48:30,560
ever done,

13905
03:48:30,560 --> 03:48:31,560
and much as she had

13906
03:48:31,560 --> 03:48:32,120
always been

13907
03:48:32,120 --> 03:48:33,320
disposed to like him.

13908
03:48:33,500 --> 03:48:34,100
She could not.

13909
03:48:34,100 --> 03:48:35,300
Think without anger,

13910
03:48:35,420 --> 03:48:37,680
hardly without on that

13911
03:48:37,680 --> 03:48:38,900
easiness of temper,

13912
03:48:39,060 --> 03:48:39,960
that want of

13913
03:48:39,960 --> 03:48:41,160
proper resolution,

13914
03:48:41,280 --> 03:48:42,180
which now made him

13915
03:48:42,180 --> 03:48:42,840
the slave

13916
03:48:42,840 --> 03:48:44,100
of his designing friends

13917
03:48:44,300 --> 03:48:45,680
and led him to sacrifice

13918
03:48:45,680 --> 03:48:46,100
of his own

13919
03:48:46,100 --> 03:48:47,480
happiness to the caprice

13920
03:48:47,480 --> 03:48:48,680
of their inclination,

13921
03:48:49,140 --> 03:48:50,280
had his own happiness.

13922
03:48:50,280 --> 03:48:50,600
However,

13923
03:48:50,600 --> 03:48:51,920
being the only sacrifice

13924
03:48:52,080 --> 03:48:52,700
he might have been

13925
03:48:52,700 --> 03:48:53,520
allowed to sport

13926
03:48:53,520 --> 03:48:54,060
with it in

13927
03:48:54,060 --> 03:48:54,680
whatever manner

13928
03:48:54,680 --> 03:48:55,860
he thought best.

13929
03:48:55,860 --> 03:48:56,820
But Sisters

13930
03:48:56,820 --> 03:48:57,980
was involved in it

13931
03:48:57,980 --> 03:48:58,880
as she thought.

13932
03:48:58,880 --> 03:48:59,360
He must be

13933
03:48:59,360 --> 03:49:00,560
sensible himself.

13934
03:49:01,040 --> 03:49:02,100
It was a subject,

13935
03:49:02,100 --> 03:49:02,640
in short,

13936
03:49:02,640 --> 03:49:03,620
on which reflection

13937
03:49:03,620 --> 03:49:04,820
would be long indulged

13938
03:49:04,940 --> 03:49:06,260
and must be unavailing.

13939
03:49:06,560 --> 03:49:07,160
She could think of

13940
03:49:07,160 --> 03:49:08,000
nothing else.

13941
03:49:08,000 --> 03:49:08,580
And yet

13942
03:49:08,580 --> 03:49:09,680
whether Bailey's regard

13943
03:49:09,680 --> 03:49:10,880
had really died away

13944
03:49:11,000 --> 03:49:11,940
or were suppressed

13945
03:49:11,940 --> 03:49:12,260
by his

13946
03:49:12,260 --> 03:49:13,460
friend's interference.

13947
03:49:13,640 --> 03:49:14,120
Whether he

13948
03:49:14,120 --> 03:49:14,720
had been aware

13949
03:49:14,720 --> 03:49:15,920
of Jane's attachment

13950
03:49:15,960 --> 03:49:16,500
or, whether

13951
03:49:16,500 --> 03:49:17,180
it had escaped

13952
03:49:17,180 --> 03:49:18,380
his observation.

13953
03:49:18,420 --> 03:49:19,640
Whatever were the case,

13954
03:49:19,860 --> 03:49:20,340
though, her

13955
03:49:20,340 --> 03:49:21,020
opinion of him

13956
03:49:21,020 --> 03:49:21,380
must be

13957
03:49:21,380 --> 03:49:22,380
materially affected

13958
03:49:22,380 --> 03:49:23,360
by the difference.

13959
03:49:23,360 --> 03:49:24,620
Her sister's situation

13960
03:49:24,620 --> 03:49:25,800
remained the same.

13961
03:49:25,800 --> 03:49:27,020
Her Peace equally.

13962
03:49:27,020 --> 03:49:27,600
Wounded.

13963
03:49:28,700 --> 03:49:29,340
A day or two

13964
03:49:29,340 --> 03:49:30,080
passed before

13965
03:49:30,080 --> 03:49:31,020
Jane had courage

13966
03:49:31,020 --> 03:49:32,000
to speak of her feelings

13967
03:49:32,000 --> 03:49:33,000
to Elizabeth.

13968
03:49:33,000 --> 03:49:34,220
But at last on, Mrs.

13969
03:49:34,220 --> 03:49:34,580
Bennett's

13970
03:49:34,580 --> 03:49:35,660
leaving them together

13971
03:49:35,660 --> 03:49:36,140
after a

13972
03:49:36,140 --> 03:49:37,200
longer irritation

13973
03:49:37,200 --> 03:49:37,800
than usual

13974
03:49:37,800 --> 03:49:38,600
about Netherfield

13975
03:49:38,600 --> 03:49:39,660
and its master,

13976
03:49:39,660 --> 03:49:40,220
she could not

13977
03:49:40,220 --> 03:49:41,420
help saying.

13978
03:49:41,600 --> 03:49:42,440
Oh, that, my dear

13979
03:49:42,440 --> 03:49:42,900
mother,

13980
03:49:42,900 --> 03:49:43,320
had no

13981
03:49:43,320 --> 03:49:44,520
command of herself.

13982
03:49:44,960 --> 03:49:46,140
She have no idea

13983
03:49:46,140 --> 03:49:46,680
of the pain

13984
03:49:46,680 --> 03:49:47,580
she gives me by her

13985
03:49:47,580 --> 03:49:48,660
continual reflections

13986
03:49:48,660 --> 03:49:49,860
on him.

13987
03:49:49,980 --> 03:49:50,520
But I will not

13988
03:49:50,520 --> 03:49:51,480
draw pine.

13989
03:49:51,480 --> 03:49:52,820
It cannot last long.

13990
03:49:53,240 --> 03:49:54,440
He will be forgot.

13991
03:49:54,600 --> 03:49:55,500
And we be as

13992
03:49:55,500 --> 03:49:56,700
we were before.

13993
03:49:57,020 --> 03:49:57,600
Elizabeth

13994
03:49:57,600 --> 03:49:58,400
looked at her sister

13995
03:49:58,400 --> 03:49:59,240
with incredulous

13996
03:49:59,240 --> 03:50:00,200
solicitude,

13997
03:50:00,200 --> 03:50:01,400
but said nothing.

13998
03:50:02,060 --> 03:50:03,260
You doubt me?

13999
03:50:03,360 --> 03:50:04,580
Cried Jane, slightly.

14000
03:50:05,520 --> 03:50:06,000
Indeed,

14001
03:50:06,000 --> 03:50:07,200
you have no reason.

14002
03:50:07,440 --> 03:50:08,780
He may live in my memory

14003
03:50:08,780 --> 03:50:09,260
as the most.

14004
03:50:09,260 --> 03:50:10,020
Amiable man

14005
03:50:10,020 --> 03:50:11,220
of my acquaintance.

14006
03:50:11,280 --> 03:50:12,480
But that is all.

14007
03:50:12,600 --> 03:50:13,760
I have nothing either

14008
03:50:13,760 --> 03:50:14,960
to hope or fear

14009
03:50:15,180 --> 03:50:15,720
and nothing

14010
03:50:15,720 --> 03:50:16,920
to reproach him with.

14011
03:50:17,180 --> 03:50:18,020
Thank God

14012
03:50:18,020 --> 03:50:19,320
I have not that pain.

14013
03:50:19,860 --> 03:50:20,660
A little time.

14014
03:50:20,660 --> 03:50:21,800
Therefore, I shall.

14015
03:50:21,800 --> 03:50:22,700
Certainly try

14016
03:50:22,700 --> 03:50:23,900
to get to the better

14017
03:50:24,500 --> 03:50:25,580
with a stronger voice,

14018
03:50:25,580 --> 03:50:26,780
she soon added.

14019
03:50:27,060 --> 03:50:27,800
I have this

14020
03:50:27,800 --> 03:50:29,040
comfort immediately

14021
03:50:29,400 --> 03:50:29,880
that it has

14022
03:50:29,880 --> 03:50:30,620
not been more

14023
03:50:30,620 --> 03:50:31,820
than an error of fancy

14024
03:50:31,820 --> 03:50:32,880
on my side,

14025
03:50:32,880 --> 03:50:34,020
and that has done

14026
03:50:34,020 --> 03:50:35,300
no harm to anyone

14027
03:50:35,300 --> 03:50:36,500
but myself.

14028
03:50:37,020 --> 03:50:38,520
My dear Jane!

14029
03:50:38,720 --> 03:50:39,920
Exclaimed Elizabeth.

14030
03:50:40,160 --> 03:50:41,580
You are too good.

14031
03:50:41,900 --> 03:50:42,860
Your sweetness

14032
03:50:42,860 --> 03:50:44,060
and disinterest

14033
03:50:44,180 --> 03:50:45,380
are really angelic.

14034
03:50:45,960 --> 03:50:46,700
I do not know what

14035
03:50:46,700 --> 03:50:47,900
to say to you.

14036
03:50:48,120 --> 03:50:48,780
I feel as.

14037
03:50:48,780 --> 03:50:49,220
If I had.

14038
03:50:49,220 --> 03:50:50,540
Never done you justice

14039
03:50:50,540 --> 03:50:51,300
or loved you

14040
03:50:51,300 --> 03:50:52,500
as you deserve.

14041
03:50:52,980 --> 03:50:53,660
Miss Bennet

14042
03:50:53,660 --> 03:50:54,720
eagerly disclaimed

14043
03:50:54,720 --> 03:50:55,920
all extraordinary merit

14044
03:50:56,100 --> 03:50:56,780
and threw back

14045
03:50:56,780 --> 03:50:57,500
the praise on her

14046
03:50:57,500 --> 03:50:58,760
sister's warm affection.

14047
03:50:59,540 --> 03:51:01,140
Nay, said Elizabeth.

14048
03:51:01,520 --> 03:51:02,720
This is not fair.

14049
03:51:02,960 --> 03:51:03,620
You wish to.

14050
03:51:03,620 --> 03:51:04,040
Think all

14051
03:51:04,040 --> 03:51:05,220
the world respectable.

14052
03:51:05,220 --> 03:51:06,080
And are hurt by

14053
03:51:06,080 --> 03:51:07,280
speak ill of anybody.

14054
03:51:07,620 --> 03:51:08,420
I only want to

14055
03:51:08,420 --> 03:51:09,500
think you perfect

14056
03:51:09,500 --> 03:51:09,920
and you

14057
03:51:09,920 --> 03:51:11,360
set yourself against it.

14058
03:51:11,780 --> 03:51:12,920
Do not be afraid

14059
03:51:12,920 --> 03:51:13,520
of my running.

14060
03:51:13,520 --> 03:51:15,020
Into any excess of.

14061
03:51:15,020 --> 03:51:15,800
My encroaching

14062
03:51:15,800 --> 03:51:16,580
on your privilege

14063
03:51:16,580 --> 03:51:17,780
of universal goodwill.

14064
03:51:18,000 --> 03:51:19,200
You need not.

14065
03:51:19,340 --> 03:51:20,400
There are few people

14066
03:51:20,400 --> 03:51:21,600
whom I really love

14067
03:51:21,600 --> 03:51:22,980
and still few of whom

14068
03:51:22,980 --> 03:51:24,180
I think.

14069
03:51:24,200 --> 03:51:24,620
The more

14070
03:51:24,620 --> 03:51:25,580
I see of the world,

14071
03:51:25,580 --> 03:51:26,120
the more am I.

14072
03:51:26,120 --> 03:51:27,320
Dissatisfied with it.

14073
03:51:27,500 --> 03:51:28,980
And every day confirms

14074
03:51:28,980 --> 03:51:29,540
my belief

14075
03:51:29,540 --> 03:51:30,720
of the inconsistency

14076
03:51:30,720 --> 03:51:31,940
of all human characters

14077
03:51:32,220 --> 03:51:32,580
and of the

14078
03:51:32,580 --> 03:51:33,420
little dependance

14079
03:51:33,420 --> 03:51:34,200
that can be placed

14080
03:51:34,200 --> 03:51:34,880
on the appearance

14081
03:51:34,880 --> 03:51:36,080
of merit or sense.

14082
03:51:36,800 --> 03:51:37,340
I have met

14083
03:51:37,340 --> 03:51:38,360
with two instances

14084
03:51:38,360 --> 03:51:39,200
lately.

14085
03:51:39,200 --> 03:51:40,680
One I will not mention.

14086
03:51:40,920 --> 03:51:41,640
The other is

14087
03:51:41,640 --> 03:51:42,840
Charlotte's marriage.

14088
03:51:42,980 --> 03:51:44,280
It is unaccountable.

14089
03:51:44,420 --> 03:51:45,740
In every view, it is

14090
03:51:45,740 --> 03:51:47,000
unaccountable.

14091
03:51:47,480 --> 03:51:48,740
My dear Lizzie,

14092
03:51:49,040 --> 03:51:50,400
do not give way to such.

14093
03:51:50,420 --> 03:51:51,000
Feelings as.

14094
03:51:51,000 --> 03:51:51,720
These.

14095
03:51:51,720 --> 03:51:52,580
They will ruin your.

14096
03:51:53,720 --> 03:51:54,060
You do

14097
03:51:54,060 --> 03:51:54,440
not make

14098
03:51:54,440 --> 03:51:55,280
allowance enough

14099
03:51:55,280 --> 03:51:55,820
for difference

14100
03:51:55,820 --> 03:51:57,480
of situation and temper.

14101
03:51:58,080 --> 03:51:58,820
Consider Mr.

14102
03:51:58,820 --> 03:52:00,180
Collins respectability

14103
03:52:00,180 --> 03:52:01,280
and Charlotte's steady,

14104
03:52:01,280 --> 03:52:02,480
prudent character.

14105
03:52:02,880 --> 03:52:03,600
Remember that

14106
03:52:03,600 --> 03:52:04,200
she is one of a.

14107
03:52:04,200 --> 03:52:05,400
Large family

14108
03:52:05,460 --> 03:52:06,840
that asked to fortune.

14109
03:52:06,840 --> 03:52:07,400
It is a most

14110
03:52:07,400 --> 03:52:08,600
eligible match.

14111
03:52:08,660 --> 03:52:09,480
And to be ready to

14112
03:52:09,480 --> 03:52:11,240
believe everybody's sake

14113
03:52:11,240 --> 03:52:11,780
that she may

14114
03:52:11,780 --> 03:52:13,100
feel something, regard

14115
03:52:13,100 --> 03:52:13,700
and esteem

14116
03:52:13,700 --> 03:52:14,900
for our cousin.

14117
03:52:15,440 --> 03:52:16,260
To oblige you.

14118
03:52:16,260 --> 03:52:17,040
I would try to believe

14119
03:52:17,040 --> 03:52:18,240
almost anything,

14120
03:52:18,240 --> 03:52:19,160
but no one else could

14121
03:52:19,160 --> 03:52:20,100
be benefited by.

14122
03:52:20,100 --> 03:52:20,700
Such a belief.

14123
03:52:20,700 --> 03:52:22,100
Is this for her?

14124
03:52:22,100 --> 03:52:22,800
I persuaded

14125
03:52:22,800 --> 03:52:23,400
that Charlotte

14126
03:52:23,400 --> 03:52:24,080
had any real

14127
03:52:24,080 --> 03:52:25,160
regard for him.

14128
03:52:25,160 --> 03:52:25,700
I should only

14129
03:52:25,700 --> 03:52:26,340
think worse

14130
03:52:26,340 --> 03:52:27,140
of her understanding

14131
03:52:27,140 --> 03:52:27,620
than I now

14132
03:52:27,620 --> 03:52:28,820
do of her heart.

14133
03:52:29,240 --> 03:52:30,600
My dear Jane, Mr.

14134
03:52:30,600 --> 03:52:32,000
Collins is a conceited,

14135
03:52:32,640 --> 03:52:33,620
narrow minded,

14136
03:52:33,620 --> 03:52:34,700
silly man.

14137
03:52:34,700 --> 03:52:35,600
You know he is

14138
03:52:35,600 --> 03:52:36,800
as well as I do.

14139
03:52:36,900 --> 03:52:38,060
And you must feel as.

14140
03:52:38,060 --> 03:52:39,060
Well as I do that the.

14141
03:52:39,060 --> 03:52:40,020
Woman who married him

14142
03:52:40,020 --> 03:52:40,880
cannot have a proper

14143
03:52:40,880 --> 03:52:42,080
way of thinking.

14144
03:52:42,180 --> 03:52:43,260
He shall not defend

14145
03:52:43,260 --> 03:52:43,580
her, though.

14146
03:52:43,580 --> 03:52:44,880
It is Charlotte Lucas.

14147
03:52:45,200 --> 03:52:46,080
You shall not,

14148
03:52:46,080 --> 03:52:46,260
for the

14149
03:52:46,260 --> 03:52:47,660
sake of one individual,

14150
03:52:47,660 --> 03:52:48,120
change

14151
03:52:48,120 --> 03:52:48,560
the meaning of

14152
03:52:48,560 --> 03:52:49,980
principle and integrity,

14153
03:52:50,180 --> 03:52:50,820
nor endeavor

14154
03:52:50,820 --> 03:52:52,320
to persuade yourself me

14155
03:52:52,320 --> 03:52:53,120
that selfishness,

14156
03:52:53,120 --> 03:52:53,840
prudence

14157
03:52:53,840 --> 03:52:54,900
and insensibility

14158
03:52:54,900 --> 03:52:55,420
of danger.

14159
03:52:55,420 --> 03:52:56,820
Security for happiness.

14160
03:52:57,860 --> 03:52:58,340
I must

14161
03:52:58,340 --> 03:52:59,120
think your language

14162
03:52:59,120 --> 03:52:59,660
too strong.

14163
03:52:59,660 --> 03:53:00,860
And speaking of both,

14164
03:53:00,980 --> 03:53:02,180
replied Jane.

14165
03:53:02,300 --> 03:53:03,120
And I hope you will

14166
03:53:03,120 --> 03:53:03,900
be convinced of it

14167
03:53:03,900 --> 03:53:04,460
by seeing them

14168
03:53:04,460 --> 03:53:05,660
happy together.

14169
03:53:06,080 --> 03:53:07,280
But enough of this.

14170
03:53:07,400 --> 03:53:08,100
You alluded to

14171
03:53:08,100 --> 03:53:09,080
something else.

14172
03:53:09,080 --> 03:53:09,840
You mentioned

14173
03:53:09,840 --> 03:53:11,040
two instances.

14174
03:53:11,400 --> 03:53:12,000
I cannot

14175
03:53:12,000 --> 03:53:13,200
misunderstand you,

14176
03:53:13,220 --> 03:53:13,560
but I.

14177
03:53:13,560 --> 03:53:14,000
And treat

14178
03:53:14,000 --> 03:53:14,660
you, dear Lizzie,

14179
03:53:14,660 --> 03:53:15,560
not to pain me

14180
03:53:15,560 --> 03:53:16,100
by thinking

14181
03:53:16,100 --> 03:53:17,400
that person to blame

14182
03:53:17,600 --> 03:53:18,600
and saying your opinion

14183
03:53:18,600 --> 03:53:19,800
of him is sunk.

14184
03:53:19,920 --> 03:53:21,140
We must not be so ready

14185
03:53:21,140 --> 03:53:22,080
to fancy ourselves

14186
03:53:22,080 --> 03:53:23,280
intentionally injured.

14187
03:53:23,720 --> 03:53:24,840
We must not expect.

14188
03:53:24,840 --> 03:53:25,760
A lively young man

14189
03:53:25,760 --> 03:53:26,600
to be always so.

14190
03:53:26,600 --> 03:53:28,280
Guarded and circumspect.

14191
03:53:28,740 --> 03:53:29,700
It is very often

14192
03:53:29,700 --> 03:53:30,600
nothing but our own.

14193
03:53:30,600 --> 03:53:31,800
Vanity that deceives.

14194
03:53:32,280 --> 03:53:32,780
Women

14195
03:53:32,780 --> 03:53:34,260
fancy admiration means

14196
03:53:34,260 --> 03:53:35,460
more than it does.

14197
03:53:35,940 --> 03:53:36,720
And men

14198
03:53:36,720 --> 03:53:37,380
take care

14199
03:53:37,380 --> 03:53:38,580
that they should.

14200
03:53:39,020 --> 03:53:40,320
If it is decidedly done,

14201
03:53:40,320 --> 03:53:40,800
they cannot

14202
03:53:40,800 --> 03:53:41,840
be justified.

14203
03:53:41,840 --> 03:53:42,840
But I have no idea.

14204
03:53:42,840 --> 03:53:43,140
Of there

14205
03:53:43,140 --> 03:53:44,180
being so much design

14206
03:53:44,180 --> 03:53:45,060
in the world as some.

14207
03:53:45,060 --> 03:53:46,260
Persons imagine.

14208
03:53:46,820 --> 03:53:47,840
I am far from.

14209
03:53:47,840 --> 03:53:48,360
Attributing

14210
03:53:48,360 --> 03:53:49,200
any part of Mr.

14211
03:53:49,200 --> 03:53:50,060
Bigley's conduct

14212
03:53:50,060 --> 03:53:51,020
to design,

14213
03:53:51,020 --> 03:53:52,220
said Elizabeth.

14214
03:53:52,260 --> 03:53:53,180
But without scheming

14215
03:53:53,180 --> 03:53:54,020
to do wrong

14216
03:53:54,020 --> 03:53:54,260
or to

14217
03:53:54,260 --> 03:53:55,460
make others unhappy,

14218
03:53:55,580 --> 03:53:56,720
there may be error

14219
03:53:56,720 --> 03:53:57,920
and there may be misery.

14220
03:53:58,320 --> 03:53:59,160
Thoughtlessness.

14221
03:53:59,160 --> 03:54:00,060
I want to pay attention

14222
03:54:00,060 --> 03:54:00,360
to other

14223
03:54:00,360 --> 03:54:01,640
people's feelings and.

14224
03:54:01,640 --> 03:54:02,640
Want a resolution?

14225
03:54:02,640 --> 03:54:03,620
Will do the business.

14226
03:54:04,620 --> 03:54:05,060
And do

14227
03:54:05,060 --> 03:54:05,880
you impute it to

14228
03:54:05,880 --> 03:54:07,080
either of those?

14229
03:54:07,460 --> 03:54:09,020
Yes, to the last.

14230
03:54:09,780 --> 03:54:10,580
But if I go on,

14231
03:54:10,580 --> 03:54:11,280
I shall displease

14232
03:54:11,280 --> 03:54:11,960
you by saying what

14233
03:54:11,960 --> 03:54:12,720
I think of persons

14234
03:54:12,720 --> 03:54:13,580
you esteem.

14235
03:54:13,580 --> 03:54:14,600
Stop me whilst

14236
03:54:14,600 --> 03:54:15,800
you can.

14237
03:54:16,140 --> 03:54:17,060
You persist that

14238
03:54:17,060 --> 03:54:18,180
in supposing his sisters

14239
03:54:18,180 --> 03:54:19,380
influence him?

14240
03:54:19,740 --> 03:54:20,240
Yes.

14241
03:54:20,240 --> 03:54:21,060
In conjunction

14242
03:54:21,060 --> 03:54:22,260
with his friend.

14243
03:54:22,680 --> 03:54:23,960
I cannot believe it.

14244
03:54:24,260 --> 03:54:25,140
Why should they try

14245
03:54:25,140 --> 03:54:26,340
to influence him?

14246
03:54:26,460 --> 03:54:27,200
They can only wish

14247
03:54:27,200 --> 03:54:28,100
his happiness.

14248
03:54:28,100 --> 03:54:28,700
And if he is

14249
03:54:28,700 --> 03:54:29,900
attached to me,

14250
03:54:29,960 --> 03:54:30,800
no other woman

14251
03:54:30,800 --> 03:54:32,000
can secure.

14252
03:54:32,480 --> 03:54:33,080
Your first

14253
03:54:33,080 --> 03:54:34,280
position is false.

14254
03:54:34,280 --> 03:54:34,940
They may wish

14255
03:54:34,940 --> 03:54:35,520
many things

14256
03:54:35,520 --> 03:54:36,720
besides his happiness.

14257
03:54:36,840 --> 03:54:37,400
They may wish

14258
03:54:37,400 --> 03:54:38,000
his increase of.

14259
03:54:38,000 --> 03:54:39,200
Wealth and consequence.

14260
03:54:39,420 --> 03:54:40,140
They may wish him

14261
03:54:40,140 --> 03:54:40,920
to marry a girl

14262
03:54:40,920 --> 03:54:41,480
who has the.

14263
03:54:41,480 --> 03:54:42,540
Importance of money,

14264
03:54:42,540 --> 03:54:43,440
great connections

14265
03:54:43,440 --> 03:54:44,640
and pride.

14266
03:54:44,880 --> 03:54:45,680
Beyond doubt,

14267
03:54:45,680 --> 03:54:46,140
they do

14268
03:54:46,140 --> 03:54:46,860
wish him to choose,

14269
03:54:46,860 --> 03:54:47,940
Miss Darcy,

14270
03:54:47,940 --> 03:54:49,100
replied Jane.

14271
03:54:49,100 --> 03:54:49,860
But this may be

14272
03:54:49,860 --> 03:54:50,660
from better feelings

14273
03:54:50,660 --> 03:54:51,860
than you are supposing.

14274
03:54:52,100 --> 03:54:52,700
They have known

14275
03:54:52,700 --> 03:54:53,420
her much longer

14276
03:54:53,420 --> 03:54:54,600
than they have known me.

14277
03:54:54,600 --> 03:54:55,160
Now wonder

14278
03:54:55,160 --> 03:54:56,360
if they love her better

14279
03:54:56,700 --> 03:54:57,480
about whatever may

14280
03:54:57,480 --> 03:54:58,380
be their own wishes.

14281
03:54:58,380 --> 03:54:59,340
It is very unlikely

14282
03:54:59,340 --> 03:54:59,700
that they should

14283
03:54:59,700 --> 03:55:00,180
have opposed

14284
03:55:00,180 --> 03:55:01,380
their brothers.

14285
03:55:01,380 --> 03:55:02,000
What sister

14286
03:55:02,000 --> 03:55:02,660
would think herself

14287
03:55:02,660 --> 03:55:03,860
at liberty to do it

14288
03:55:03,900 --> 03:55:04,460
unless there

14289
03:55:04,460 --> 03:55:04,860
was something

14290
03:55:04,860 --> 03:55:06,060
very objectionable.

14291
03:55:06,300 --> 03:55:07,140
If they believed him

14292
03:55:07,140 --> 03:55:07,820
attached to me,

14293
03:55:07,820 --> 03:55:08,280
they would not

14294
03:55:08,280 --> 03:55:09,440
try to part us.

14295
03:55:09,440 --> 03:55:10,380
If he worsened,

14296
03:55:10,380 --> 03:55:11,580
they could not succeed.

14297
03:55:11,960 --> 03:55:12,620
I suppose in

14298
03:55:12,620 --> 03:55:13,520
such an affection.

14299
03:55:13,520 --> 03:55:13,820
You make

14300
03:55:13,820 --> 03:55:14,660
everybody acting

14301
03:55:14,660 --> 03:55:15,860
unnaturally and wrong

14302
03:55:16,040 --> 03:55:17,360
and me most unhappy

14303
03:55:17,880 --> 03:55:19,040
do not distress me

14304
03:55:19,040 --> 03:55:20,240
by the idea.

14305
03:55:20,340 --> 03:55:21,300
I am not ashamed of.

14306
03:55:21,300 --> 03:55:22,500
Having been mistaken.

14307
03:55:22,680 --> 03:55:24,060
Or at least it is light.

14308
03:55:24,260 --> 03:55:24,960
It is nothing

14309
03:55:24,960 --> 03:55:25,580
in comparison

14310
03:55:25,580 --> 03:55:26,400
of what I should be

14311
03:55:26,400 --> 03:55:27,360
thinking ill of him

14312
03:55:27,360 --> 03:55:28,560
or his sisters.

14313
03:55:28,700 --> 03:55:29,400
Let me take it

14314
03:55:29,400 --> 03:55:31,200
in the best in the light

14315
03:55:31,200 --> 03:55:31,800
in which it may

14316
03:55:31,800 --> 03:55:32,600
be understood.

14317
03:55:33,560 --> 03:55:34,500
Elizabeth could not

14318
03:55:34,500 --> 03:55:35,700
oppose such a wish.

14319
03:55:35,780 --> 03:55:37,160
And from this time, Mr..

14320
03:55:37,160 --> 03:55:37,880
Begley's name

14321
03:55:37,880 --> 03:55:38,520
was scarcely

14322
03:55:38,520 --> 03:55:39,200
ever mentioned

14323
03:55:39,200 --> 03:55:40,400
between them.

14324
03:55:40,580 --> 03:55:40,940
Mrs.

14325
03:55:40,940 --> 03:55:41,300
Bennett

14326
03:55:41,300 --> 03:55:42,000
still continued

14327
03:55:42,000 --> 03:55:43,320
to wonder, and we pine

14328
03:55:43,320 --> 03:55:44,040
at his returning

14329
03:55:44,040 --> 03:55:44,880
no more.

14330
03:55:44,880 --> 03:55:45,600
And though a day

14331
03:55:45,600 --> 03:55:46,440
seldom passed

14332
03:55:46,440 --> 03:55:47,120
in which Elizabeth

14333
03:55:47,120 --> 03:55:48,080
did not account for it.

14334
03:55:48,080 --> 03:55:48,900
Clearly

14335
03:55:48,900 --> 03:55:50,000
there was little chance

14336
03:55:50,000 --> 03:55:51,140
her ever considering it

14337
03:55:51,140 --> 03:55:52,400
with less perplexity.

14338
03:55:52,820 --> 03:55:53,780
Her daughter endeavored

14339
03:55:53,780 --> 03:55:54,720
to convince her of what

14340
03:55:54,720 --> 03:55:54,960
she did

14341
03:55:54,960 --> 03:55:56,160
not believe herself

14342
03:55:56,300 --> 03:55:57,200
that his attentions

14343
03:55:57,200 --> 03:55:57,720
to Jane

14344
03:55:57,720 --> 03:55:58,260
had been merely

14345
03:55:58,260 --> 03:55:59,400
the effect of a common

14346
03:55:59,400 --> 03:56:00,680
and transient liking.

14347
03:56:00,900 --> 03:56:01,640
Which ceased.

14348
03:56:01,640 --> 03:56:02,840
When he saw her no more.

14349
03:56:03,140 --> 03:56:03,740
But though

14350
03:56:03,740 --> 03:56:04,440
the probability

14351
03:56:04,440 --> 03:56:05,060
of the statement

14352
03:56:05,060 --> 03:56:05,600
was admitted

14353
03:56:05,600 --> 03:56:06,480
at the time,

14354
03:56:06,480 --> 03:56:07,620
she had the same story

14355
03:56:07,620 --> 03:56:08,880
to repeat every day.

14356
03:56:09,300 --> 03:56:09,660
Mrs.

14357
03:56:09,660 --> 03:56:10,920
Bennett's best comfort

14358
03:56:10,920 --> 03:56:11,580
was that Mr.

14359
03:56:11,580 --> 03:56:11,900
Bingley

14360
03:56:11,900 --> 03:56:12,800
must be down again

14361
03:56:12,800 --> 03:56:14,000
in the summer.

14362
03:56:14,060 --> 03:56:14,420
Mr.

14363
03:56:14,420 --> 03:56:15,140
Bennett treated

14364
03:56:15,140 --> 03:56:16,340
the matter differently.

14365
03:56:16,740 --> 03:56:17,940
So Lizzie.

14366
03:56:18,120 --> 03:56:19,320
Said he, one day.

14367
03:56:19,880 --> 03:56:21,140
Your sister is crossed

14368
03:56:21,140 --> 03:56:21,600
in love.

14369
03:56:21,600 --> 03:56:22,140
I find.

14370
03:56:22,140 --> 03:56:23,340
I congratulate her

14371
03:56:23,840 --> 03:56:24,980
next to being married.

14372
03:56:24,980 --> 03:56:25,400
A girl

14373
03:56:25,400 --> 03:56:26,640
likes to be crossed in

14374
03:56:26,640 --> 03:56:27,440
love a little now

14375
03:56:27,440 --> 03:56:28,260
and then.

14376
03:56:28,260 --> 03:56:28,920
It is something

14377
03:56:28,920 --> 03:56:29,640
to think of

14378
03:56:29,640 --> 03:56:30,180
and gives her

14379
03:56:30,180 --> 03:56:31,700
a sort of distinction

14380
03:56:31,700 --> 03:56:33,140
among her companions.

14381
03:56:33,600 --> 03:56:34,380
When is your turn

14382
03:56:34,380 --> 03:56:34,880
to come?

14383
03:56:34,880 --> 03:56:35,640
You will hardly bear

14384
03:56:35,640 --> 03:56:35,880
to be

14385
03:56:35,880 --> 03:56:37,280
long outdone by Jane.

14386
03:56:38,460 --> 03:56:38,840
Now Is

14387
03:56:38,840 --> 03:56:40,040
your time

14388
03:56:40,680 --> 03:56:40,920
here?

14389
03:56:40,920 --> 03:56:41,520
Are officers

14390
03:56:41,520 --> 03:56:42,260
enough at Meriden

14391
03:56:42,260 --> 03:56:42,920
to disappoint

14392
03:56:42,920 --> 03:56:43,820
all the young ladies

14393
03:56:43,820 --> 03:56:44,960
in the country?

14394
03:56:44,960 --> 03:56:46,440
Let Wickham be your man.

14395
03:56:46,620 --> 03:56:47,820
He's a pleasant fellow

14396
03:56:47,940 --> 03:56:48,240
and would

14397
03:56:48,240 --> 03:56:49,520
jilt creditably.

14398
03:56:50,660 --> 03:56:51,620
Thank you, sir.

14399
03:56:51,620 --> 03:56:52,220
But a less.

14400
03:56:52,220 --> 03:56:52,920
Agreeable man

14401
03:56:52,920 --> 03:56:53,900
would satisfy me.

14402
03:56:53,900 --> 03:56:55,340
We must not all expect

14403
03:56:55,340 --> 03:56:56,540
Jane's good fortune.

14404
03:56:56,900 --> 03:56:58,200
True, said Mr.

14405
03:56:58,200 --> 03:56:58,580
Bennett.

14406
03:56:58,580 --> 03:56:59,660
But it is a comfort

14407
03:56:59,660 --> 03:57:01,220
to think that whatever

14408
03:57:01,220 --> 03:57:01,880
of that kind

14409
03:57:01,880 --> 03:57:03,000
may befall you.

14410
03:57:03,000 --> 03:57:04,260
You have an affectionate

14411
03:57:04,260 --> 03:57:04,700
mother

14412
03:57:04,700 --> 03:57:05,520
who will always

14413
03:57:05,520 --> 03:57:06,720
make the most of it.

14414
03:57:06,800 --> 03:57:07,140
Mr.

14415
03:57:07,140 --> 03:57:07,440
Wickham,

14416
03:57:07,440 --> 03:57:08,240
Society was

14417
03:57:08,240 --> 03:57:09,200
of material service

14418
03:57:09,200 --> 03:57:10,200
in dispelling the gloom,

14419
03:57:10,200 --> 03:57:10,760
which the late

14420
03:57:10,760 --> 03:57:11,840
perverse occurrences

14421
03:57:11,840 --> 03:57:12,440
had thrown on

14422
03:57:12,440 --> 03:57:13,100
many of the long

14423
03:57:13,100 --> 03:57:14,220
born family.

14424
03:57:14,220 --> 03:57:15,420
They saw him often

14425
03:57:15,560 --> 03:57:16,040
and to.

14426
03:57:16,040 --> 03:57:16,440
His other

14427
03:57:16,440 --> 03:57:17,700
recommendations was now

14428
03:57:17,700 --> 03:57:18,840
added that of General

14429
03:57:18,840 --> 03:57:20,040
unreserved.

14430
03:57:20,060 --> 03:57:20,660
The whole of.

14431
03:57:20,660 --> 03:57:21,240
What Elizabeth

14432
03:57:21,240 --> 03:57:22,380
had already heard

14433
03:57:22,380 --> 03:57:23,400
his claims on Mr.

14434
03:57:23,400 --> 03:57:24,600
D'Arcy and all that

14435
03:57:24,600 --> 03:57:25,800
he had suffered from him

14436
03:57:25,880 --> 03:57:26,300
was now

14437
03:57:26,300 --> 03:57:27,360
openly acknowledged

14438
03:57:27,360 --> 03:57:28,560
and publicly canvased

14439
03:57:28,760 --> 03:57:29,480
and everybody

14440
03:57:29,480 --> 03:57:29,960
was pleased

14441
03:57:29,960 --> 03:57:30,300
to know

14442
03:57:30,300 --> 03:57:30,900
how much they had

14443
03:57:30,900 --> 03:57:32,060
always disliked Mr.

14444
03:57:32,060 --> 03:57:33,320
D'Arcy before they had

14445
03:57:33,320 --> 03:57:34,040
known anything

14446
03:57:34,040 --> 03:57:34,680
of the matter.

14447
03:57:35,660 --> 03:57:36,500
Miss Spanish was the

14448
03:57:36,500 --> 03:57:37,160
only creature

14449
03:57:37,160 --> 03:57:37,940
who could suppose there

14450
03:57:37,940 --> 03:57:39,200
might be any extenuating

14451
03:57:39,200 --> 03:57:39,960
circumstances

14452
03:57:39,960 --> 03:57:41,220
in the case, unknown

14453
03:57:41,220 --> 03:57:41,940
to the Society

14454
03:57:41,940 --> 03:57:43,140
of Hertfordshire.

14455
03:57:43,140 --> 03:57:44,180
Her mild and steady

14456
03:57:44,180 --> 03:57:45,500
candor always pleaded

14457
03:57:45,500 --> 03:57:47,180
for allowances and urged

14458
03:57:47,180 --> 03:57:47,900
the possibility

14459
03:57:47,900 --> 03:57:48,960
of mistakes.

14460
03:57:48,960 --> 03:57:49,820
But by everybody

14461
03:57:49,820 --> 03:57:50,780
else, Mr.

14462
03:57:50,780 --> 03:57:52,040
Darcy was condemned

14463
03:57:52,040 --> 03:57:53,460
as the worst of men.

14464
03:57:55,560 --> 03:57:56,760
Chapter 25.

14465
03:57:57,960 --> 03:57:58,740
After a week

14466
03:57:58,740 --> 03:57:59,840
spent in professions

14467
03:57:59,840 --> 03:58:00,320
of love

14468
03:58:00,320 --> 03:58:00,900
and schemes

14469
03:58:00,900 --> 03:58:02,180
of Felicity, Mr.

14470
03:58:02,180 --> 03:58:03,140
Collins was called

14471
03:58:03,140 --> 03:58:03,920
from his amiable

14472
03:58:03,920 --> 03:58:04,400
Charlotte

14473
03:58:04,400 --> 03:58:05,780
by the arrival Saturday.

14474
03:58:06,180 --> 03:58:07,440
The pain of separation,

14475
03:58:07,440 --> 03:58:08,100
however, might

14476
03:58:08,100 --> 03:58:08,840
be alleviated

14477
03:58:08,840 --> 03:58:09,780
on his side

14478
03:58:09,780 --> 03:58:10,740
by preparations

14479
03:58:10,740 --> 03:58:11,480
for the reception

14480
03:58:11,480 --> 03:58:12,500
of his bride,

14481
03:58:12,500 --> 03:58:13,400
as he had reason

14482
03:58:13,400 --> 03:58:14,640
to hope that shortly

14483
03:58:14,640 --> 03:58:15,380
after his return

14484
03:58:15,380 --> 03:58:16,440
into Hertfordshire

14485
03:58:16,440 --> 03:58:17,480
the day would be fixed.

14486
03:58:17,480 --> 03:58:18,200
That was to make him

14487
03:58:18,200 --> 03:58:19,500
the happiest of men.

14488
03:58:19,940 --> 03:58:20,640
He took leave

14489
03:58:20,640 --> 03:58:21,380
of his relations

14490
03:58:21,380 --> 03:58:21,980
at long, borne

14491
03:58:21,980 --> 03:58:23,100
with as much solemnity

14492
03:58:23,100 --> 03:58:23,960
as before,

14493
03:58:23,960 --> 03:58:24,680
wished his fair

14494
03:58:24,680 --> 03:58:25,380
cousin's health

14495
03:58:25,380 --> 03:58:26,220
and happiness,

14496
03:58:26,220 --> 03:58:27,000
and promised

14497
03:58:27,000 --> 03:58:27,620
their father

14498
03:58:27,620 --> 03:58:28,400
another letter

14499
03:58:28,400 --> 03:58:29,600
of thanks.

14500
03:58:29,700 --> 03:58:30,420
On the following

14501
03:58:30,420 --> 03:58:31,400
Monday, Mrs.

14502
03:58:31,400 --> 03:58:32,280
Bennett had the pleasure

14503
03:58:32,280 --> 03:58:33,240
of receiving her brother

14504
03:58:33,240 --> 03:58:34,100
and his wife,

14505
03:58:34,100 --> 03:58:35,100
who came, as usual,

14506
03:58:35,100 --> 03:58:36,080
to spend the Christmas

14507
03:58:36,080 --> 03:58:37,260
at Long Bourn.

14508
03:58:37,260 --> 03:58:37,580
Mr.

14509
03:58:37,580 --> 03:58:38,780
Gardner was a sensible

14510
03:58:38,780 --> 03:58:39,960
gentleman like man,

14511
03:58:39,960 --> 03:58:40,880
greatly superior

14512
03:58:40,880 --> 03:58:41,760
to his sister,

14513
03:58:41,760 --> 03:58:42,800
as well by nature

14514
03:58:42,800 --> 03:58:44,000
as education.

14515
03:58:44,060 --> 03:58:45,080
The Netherfield ladies

14516
03:58:45,080 --> 03:58:45,300
would have

14517
03:58:45,300 --> 03:58:46,040
had difficulty

14518
03:58:46,040 --> 03:58:46,560
in believing

14519
03:58:46,560 --> 03:58:47,000
that a man

14520
03:58:47,000 --> 03:58:48,200
who lived by trade

14521
03:58:48,320 --> 03:58:48,980
and within view

14522
03:58:48,980 --> 03:58:50,180
of his own warehouses

14523
03:58:50,280 --> 03:58:50,820
could have been

14524
03:58:50,820 --> 03:58:51,800
so well-bred

14525
03:58:51,800 --> 03:58:53,000
and agreeable.

14526
03:58:53,120 --> 03:58:53,520
Mrs.

14527
03:58:53,520 --> 03:58:54,060
Gardner

14528
03:58:54,060 --> 03:58:54,720
was several years

14529
03:58:54,720 --> 03:58:55,440
younger than Mrs.

14530
03:58:55,440 --> 03:58:56,120
Bennett, and Mrs.

14531
03:58:56,120 --> 03:58:57,660
Phillips was an amiable,

14532
03:58:57,660 --> 03:58:58,280
intelligent,

14533
03:58:58,280 --> 03:58:59,300
elegant woman

14534
03:58:59,300 --> 03:59:00,300
and a great favorite

14535
03:59:00,300 --> 03:59:00,780
with all her

14536
03:59:00,780 --> 03:59:01,980
long born nieces.

14537
03:59:02,160 --> 03:59:02,640
Between the.

14538
03:59:02,640 --> 03:59:03,860
Two eldest and herself

14539
03:59:03,860 --> 03:59:04,700
especially,

14540
03:59:04,700 --> 03:59:05,460
there subsisted

14541
03:59:05,460 --> 03:59:06,660
a particular regard.

14542
03:59:06,920 --> 03:59:07,860
They had frequently been

14543
03:59:07,860 --> 03:59:08,540
staying with her

14544
03:59:08,540 --> 03:59:09,540
in town.

14545
03:59:09,540 --> 03:59:10,760
The first part of Mrs.

14546
03:59:10,760 --> 03:59:11,240
Gardner's

14547
03:59:11,240 --> 03:59:12,440
business on her arrival

14548
03:59:12,620 --> 03:59:13,520
was to distribute

14549
03:59:13,520 --> 03:59:14,160
her presents

14550
03:59:14,160 --> 03:59:14,780
and describe

14551
03:59:14,780 --> 03:59:15,980
the newest fashions.

14552
03:59:16,160 --> 03:59:16,980
When this was done,

14553
03:59:16,980 --> 03:59:17,640
she had a less

14554
03:59:17,640 --> 03:59:18,840
active part to play.

14555
03:59:19,100 --> 03:59:19,820
It became her

14556
03:59:19,820 --> 03:59:21,020
turn to listen.

14557
03:59:21,080 --> 03:59:21,480
Mrs.

14558
03:59:21,480 --> 03:59:21,800
Bennett

14559
03:59:21,800 --> 03:59:22,740
had many grievances

14560
03:59:22,740 --> 03:59:23,400
to relate

14561
03:59:23,400 --> 03:59:24,800
and much to complain of.

14562
03:59:25,100 --> 03:59:25,860
They had all been

14563
03:59:25,860 --> 03:59:27,160
very ill used

14564
03:59:27,160 --> 03:59:27,720
since she last

14565
03:59:27,720 --> 03:59:28,760
saw her sister.

14566
03:59:28,760 --> 03:59:29,600
Two of her girls

14567
03:59:29,600 --> 03:59:30,060
had been upon

14568
03:59:30,060 --> 03:59:30,980
the point of marriage,

14569
03:59:30,980 --> 03:59:31,820
and after all,

14570
03:59:31,820 --> 03:59:33,020
there was nothing in it.

14571
03:59:33,500 --> 03:59:35,160
No, I do not blame Jane,

14572
03:59:35,360 --> 03:59:36,440
she continued,

14573
03:59:36,440 --> 03:59:37,080
for Jane

14574
03:59:37,080 --> 03:59:37,940
would have got to Mr.

14575
03:59:37,940 --> 03:59:39,140
Bingley if she could.

14576
03:59:39,420 --> 03:59:40,620
But, Lizzie.

14577
03:59:40,700 --> 03:59:41,900
Oh, sister,

14578
03:59:42,080 --> 03:59:43,280
it is hard

14579
03:59:43,280 --> 03:59:43,580
to think

14580
03:59:43,580 --> 03:59:44,640
she might have been Mr.

14581
03:59:44,640 --> 03:59:45,480
Collins wife

14582
03:59:45,480 --> 03:59:46,680
by this time had it

14583
03:59:46,680 --> 03:59:47,720
not been for her own

14584
03:59:47,720 --> 03:59:48,920
perverse niece.

14585
03:59:49,020 --> 03:59:50,220
He made her an offer

14586
03:59:50,220 --> 03:59:51,420
in this very room,

14587
03:59:51,480 --> 03:59:52,680
and she refused.

14588
03:59:53,180 --> 03:59:54,360
The consequence of it

14589
03:59:54,360 --> 03:59:55,400
is, is that Lady

14590
03:59:55,400 --> 03:59:55,980
Lucas will

14591
03:59:55,980 --> 03:59:56,520
have a daughter

14592
03:59:56,520 --> 03:59:57,720
married before I have,

14593
03:59:57,800 --> 03:59:58,520
and that the long

14594
03:59:58,520 --> 03:59:59,280
born estate is

14595
03:59:59,280 --> 03:59:59,940
just as much

14596
03:59:59,940 --> 04:00:01,140
entailed as ever.

14597
04:00:01,460 --> 04:00:02,900
The Lucas is very artful

14598
04:00:02,900 --> 04:00:04,320
people indeed, sister.

14599
04:00:04,500 --> 04:00:05,280
They are all for

14600
04:00:05,280 --> 04:00:06,480
what they can get.

14601
04:00:06,500 --> 04:00:07,400
I am sorry to say it

14602
04:00:07,400 --> 04:00:08,100
to them, but.

14603
04:00:08,100 --> 04:00:09,140
So it is.

14604
04:00:09,140 --> 04:00:10,320
It makes me very nervous

14605
04:00:10,320 --> 04:00:10,860
and poorly

14606
04:00:10,860 --> 04:00:11,660
to be thwarted.

14607
04:00:11,660 --> 04:00:12,860
So my own family

14608
04:00:12,980 --> 04:00:13,860
and to have neighbors

14609
04:00:13,860 --> 04:00:14,780
who think of themselves

14610
04:00:14,780 --> 04:00:15,980
before anybody else.

14611
04:00:16,460 --> 04:00:17,420
However, your coming

14612
04:00:17,420 --> 04:00:18,260
just at this time

14613
04:00:18,260 --> 04:00:18,440
is the

14614
04:00:18,440 --> 04:00:19,640
greatest of comforts,

14615
04:00:19,800 --> 04:00:20,700
and I am very glad

14616
04:00:20,700 --> 04:00:21,000
to hear

14617
04:00:21,000 --> 04:00:21,600
what you tell us

14618
04:00:21,600 --> 04:00:22,980
of Sleeves.

14619
04:00:23,880 --> 04:00:24,200
Mrs.

14620
04:00:24,200 --> 04:00:24,920
Gardiner,

14621
04:00:24,920 --> 04:00:25,280
to whom

14622
04:00:25,280 --> 04:00:26,240
the chief of this news

14623
04:00:26,240 --> 04:00:26,760
had been given

14624
04:00:26,760 --> 04:00:27,200
before

14625
04:00:27,200 --> 04:00:28,200
in the course of Jane

14626
04:00:28,200 --> 04:00:28,760
and Elizabeth's

14627
04:00:28,760 --> 04:00:29,960
correspondence with her

14628
04:00:30,180 --> 04:00:31,460
made her sister a slight

14629
04:00:32,220 --> 04:00:33,060
and in compassion

14630
04:00:33,060 --> 04:00:33,260
to her.

14631
04:00:33,260 --> 04:00:33,920
Nieces,

14632
04:00:33,920 --> 04:00:35,400
turned the conversation

14633
04:00:36,240 --> 04:00:36,440
when.

14634
04:00:36,440 --> 04:00:37,320
Alone with Elizabeth.

14635
04:00:37,320 --> 04:00:38,000
Afterwards,

14636
04:00:38,000 --> 04:00:38,820
she spoke more

14637
04:00:38,820 --> 04:00:40,020
on the subject.

14638
04:00:40,340 --> 04:00:41,360
It seems likely

14639
04:00:41,360 --> 04:00:41,720
to have been

14640
04:00:41,720 --> 04:00:42,560
a desirable match

14641
04:00:42,560 --> 04:00:44,100
for Jane, said she.

14642
04:00:44,540 --> 04:00:45,840
I am sorry it went off,

14643
04:00:46,260 --> 04:00:47,380
but these things happen

14644
04:00:47,380 --> 04:00:48,420
so often.

14645
04:00:48,420 --> 04:00:49,200
A young man

14646
04:00:49,200 --> 04:00:49,580
such as you

14647
04:00:49,580 --> 04:00:50,240
describe, Mr.

14648
04:00:50,240 --> 04:00:50,880
Bingley.

14649
04:00:50,880 --> 04:00:51,620
So easily.

14650
04:00:51,620 --> 04:00:52,320
Falls in love

14651
04:00:52,320 --> 04:00:53,000
with a pretty girl

14652
04:00:53,000 --> 04:00:54,000
for a few. Weeks.

14653
04:00:54,000 --> 04:00:54,880
And when accident

14654
04:00:54,880 --> 04:00:55,740
separates them,

14655
04:00:55,740 --> 04:00:56,940
so easily forgets

14656
04:00:57,420 --> 04:00:57,840
that these

14657
04:00:57,840 --> 04:00:59,060
sort of inconsistencies

14658
04:00:59,060 --> 04:01:00,260
are very frequent,

14659
04:01:00,800 --> 04:01:01,560
an excellent

14660
04:01:01,560 --> 04:01:02,900
consolation in its way,

14661
04:01:03,080 --> 04:01:04,160
said Elizabeth.

14662
04:01:04,160 --> 04:01:04,560
But it will

14663
04:01:04,560 --> 04:01:05,760
not do for us.

14664
04:01:05,820 --> 04:01:06,360
We do not

14665
04:01:06,360 --> 04:01:07,560
suffer by accident.

14666
04:01:07,800 --> 04:01:08,960
It does not often happen

14667
04:01:08,960 --> 04:01:09,840
that the interference

14668
04:01:09,840 --> 04:01:10,460
of friends

14669
04:01:10,460 --> 04:01:11,340
persuade a young man

14670
04:01:11,340 --> 04:01:12,540
of independent fortune

14671
04:01:12,740 --> 04:01:13,380
to think no

14672
04:01:13,380 --> 04:01:14,120
more of a girl

14673
04:01:14,120 --> 04:01:15,180
he was violently in love

14674
04:01:15,180 --> 04:01:15,620
with only a

14675
04:01:15,620 --> 04:01:16,820
few days before.

14676
04:01:17,160 --> 04:01:18,440
But that expression

14677
04:01:18,440 --> 04:01:19,880
of violently in love

14678
04:01:19,880 --> 04:01:21,080
is so hackneyed,

14679
04:01:21,140 --> 04:01:22,320
so doubtful,

14680
04:01:22,320 --> 04:01:23,280
so indefinite

14681
04:01:23,280 --> 04:01:23,840
that it gives me

14682
04:01:23,840 --> 04:01:25,040
very little idea.

14683
04:01:25,460 --> 04:01:26,480
It is as often

14684
04:01:26,480 --> 04:01:27,360
applied to feelings

14685
04:01:27,360 --> 04:01:27,900
which arise

14686
04:01:27,900 --> 04:01:28,380
from a half

14687
04:01:28,380 --> 04:01:29,580
hour's acquaintance

14688
04:01:29,580 --> 04:01:30,360
as to a real

14689
04:01:30,360 --> 04:01:31,560
strong attachment.

14690
04:01:32,220 --> 04:01:33,720
How violent was Mr.

14691
04:01:33,720 --> 04:01:34,920
Begley's love?

14692
04:01:35,280 --> 04:01:36,240
I never saw a more

14693
04:01:36,240 --> 04:01:37,440
promising incarnation.

14694
04:01:37,580 --> 04:01:38,120
He was growing

14695
04:01:38,120 --> 04:01:39,140
quite inattentive.

14696
04:01:39,140 --> 04:01:40,140
To other people.

14697
04:01:40,140 --> 04:01:40,640
And wholly

14698
04:01:40,640 --> 04:01:41,840
engrossed by her.

14699
04:01:42,200 --> 04:01:43,160
Every time they met,

14700
04:01:43,160 --> 04:01:44,220
it was more decided

14701
04:01:44,220 --> 04:01:45,420
and remarkable.

14702
04:01:45,440 --> 04:01:46,460
At his own ball,

14703
04:01:46,460 --> 04:01:47,040
he offended

14704
04:01:47,040 --> 04:01:47,640
two or three

14705
04:01:47,640 --> 04:01:48,240
young ladies

14706
04:01:48,240 --> 04:01:48,600
by not

14707
04:01:48,600 --> 04:01:49,800
asking them to dance.

14708
04:01:49,940 --> 04:01:50,720
And I spoke to him.

14709
04:01:50,720 --> 04:01:51,680
Twice myself

14710
04:01:51,680 --> 04:01:52,380
without receiving an.

14711
04:01:52,380 --> 04:01:53,360
Answer.

14712
04:01:53,360 --> 04:01:54,260
Could there be finer

14713
04:01:54,260 --> 04:01:55,040
symptoms?

14714
04:01:55,040 --> 04:01:55,580
Is not

14715
04:01:55,580 --> 04:01:56,880
general incivility

14716
04:01:56,880 --> 04:01:58,220
the very essence of love?

14717
04:01:59,160 --> 04:02:00,180
Oh Yes.

14718
04:02:00,180 --> 04:02:01,140
Of that kind of love,

14719
04:02:01,140 --> 04:02:01,860
which I suppose him

14720
04:02:01,860 --> 04:02:03,860
to have felt for Jane.

14721
04:02:04,280 --> 04:02:05,480
I am sorry for her.

14722
04:02:05,760 --> 04:02:06,180
Because with

14723
04:02:06,180 --> 04:02:06,960
her disposition,

14724
04:02:06,960 --> 04:02:07,940
she may not get over it

14725
04:02:07,940 --> 04:02:09,140
immediately.

14726
04:02:09,140 --> 04:02:09,840
It had better have

14727
04:02:09,840 --> 04:02:11,040
happened to you, Lizzie.

14728
04:02:11,220 --> 04:02:11,640
You would have

14729
04:02:11,640 --> 04:02:12,440
laughed yourself

14730
04:02:12,440 --> 04:02:13,640
out of it sooner.

14731
04:02:14,100 --> 04:02:14,960
But do you think

14732
04:02:14,960 --> 04:02:15,720
she would be prevailed

14733
04:02:15,720 --> 04:02:16,920
upon to go back with us?

14734
04:02:17,280 --> 04:02:18,180
Change of scene

14735
04:02:18,180 --> 04:02:19,380
might be of service.

14736
04:02:19,620 --> 04:02:20,360
And perhaps a

14737
04:02:20,360 --> 04:02:21,480
little relief from home

14738
04:02:21,480 --> 04:02:22,320
may be as useful

14739
04:02:22,320 --> 04:02:23,520
as anything.

14740
04:02:23,840 --> 04:02:24,560
Elizabeth was

14741
04:02:24,560 --> 04:02:25,560
exceedingly pleased

14742
04:02:25,560 --> 04:02:26,600
with this proposal

14743
04:02:26,600 --> 04:02:27,060
and felt

14744
04:02:27,060 --> 04:02:27,780
persuaded of her

14745
04:02:27,780 --> 04:02:28,220
sister's

14746
04:02:28,220 --> 04:02:29,420
rowdy acquiescence.

14747
04:02:30,200 --> 04:02:31,920
I hope, added Mrs.

14748
04:02:31,920 --> 04:02:32,900
Gardiner,

14749
04:02:32,900 --> 04:02:34,080
that's no consideration.

14750
04:02:34,080 --> 04:02:34,520
With regard

14751
04:02:34,520 --> 04:02:35,360
to this young man.

14752
04:02:35,360 --> 04:02:36,560
Influence her.

14753
04:02:36,780 --> 04:02:37,940
We live in so different

14754
04:02:37,940 --> 04:02:39,080
to part of town.

14755
04:02:39,080 --> 04:02:40,140
All our connections

14756
04:02:40,140 --> 04:02:41,160
are so different.

14757
04:02:41,160 --> 04:02:42,080
And as you well know,

14758
04:02:42,080 --> 04:02:42,680
we go out so.

14759
04:02:42,680 --> 04:02:43,380
Little

14760
04:02:43,380 --> 04:02:43,760
that it is

14761
04:02:43,760 --> 04:02:44,580
very improbable

14762
04:02:44,580 --> 04:02:44,940
that they should

14763
04:02:44,940 --> 04:02:45,860
meet at all

14764
04:02:45,860 --> 04:02:46,860
unless he really comes

14765
04:02:46,860 --> 04:02:48,060
to see her.

14766
04:02:48,420 --> 04:02:49,140
And that

14767
04:02:49,140 --> 04:02:50,340
quite impossible.

14768
04:02:50,400 --> 04:02:51,060
But he is now

14769
04:02:51,060 --> 04:02:51,800
in the custody

14770
04:02:51,800 --> 04:02:52,760
of his friend.

14771
04:02:52,760 --> 04:02:53,280
And Mr.

14772
04:02:53,280 --> 04:02:54,060
Darcy would no

14773
04:02:54,060 --> 04:02:54,780
more suffer him

14774
04:02:54,780 --> 04:02:55,580
to call on Jane

14775
04:02:55,580 --> 04:02:56,280
in such a part

14776
04:02:56,280 --> 04:02:57,480
of London.

14777
04:02:57,560 --> 04:02:58,500
My dear aunt,

14778
04:02:58,500 --> 04:02:59,700
how you think of it?

14779
04:02:59,780 --> 04:03:00,660
Mr. Darcy may.

14780
04:03:00,660 --> 04:03:01,080
Perhaps.

14781
04:03:01,080 --> 04:03:01,700
Have heard of

14782
04:03:01,700 --> 04:03:02,280
such a place

14783
04:03:02,280 --> 04:03:03,480
as Grace Church Street,

14784
04:03:03,500 --> 04:03:03,920
but he would

14785
04:03:03,920 --> 04:03:04,620
hardly think

14786
04:03:04,620 --> 04:03:05,640
a month's ablution

14787
04:03:05,640 --> 04:03:06,680
enough to cleanse him

14788
04:03:06,680 --> 04:03:07,820
from its impurities.

14789
04:03:07,820 --> 04:03:08,880
What he wants to

14790
04:03:08,880 --> 04:03:09,720
enter it

14791
04:03:09,720 --> 04:03:10,580
then depend upon it.

14792
04:03:10,580 --> 04:03:10,820
Mr.

14793
04:03:10,820 --> 04:03:11,340
Bingley never

14794
04:03:11,340 --> 04:03:12,500
stood without him.

14795
04:03:13,460 --> 04:03:14,660
So much the better.

14796
04:03:14,760 --> 04:03:15,200
I hope

14797
04:03:15,200 --> 04:03:15,660
they will not

14798
04:03:15,660 --> 04:03:16,860
meet at all.

14799
04:03:16,920 --> 04:03:17,760
But does not Jane

14800
04:03:17,760 --> 04:03:18,480
correspond with

14801
04:03:18,480 --> 04:03:19,440
his sister?

14802
04:03:19,440 --> 04:03:20,360
She will not be able

14803
04:03:20,360 --> 04:03:21,560
to help calling.

14804
04:03:21,980 --> 04:03:22,880
She will drop

14805
04:03:22,880 --> 04:03:23,640
the acquaintance

14806
04:03:23,640 --> 04:03:24,840
entirely.

14807
04:03:25,640 --> 04:03:26,300
But in spite.

14808
04:03:26,300 --> 04:03:26,960
Of the certainty

14809
04:03:26,960 --> 04:03:27,620
in which Elizabeth

14810
04:03:27,620 --> 04:03:28,020
affected

14811
04:03:28,020 --> 04:03:29,180
to place this point,

14812
04:03:29,180 --> 04:03:29,600
as well

14813
04:03:29,600 --> 04:03:30,080
as the still

14814
04:03:30,080 --> 04:03:30,840
more interesting,

14815
04:03:30,840 --> 04:03:31,560
one of Bingley is

14816
04:03:31,560 --> 04:03:32,180
being withheld

14817
04:03:32,180 --> 04:03:32,660
from seeing.

14818
04:03:32,660 --> 04:03:33,380
Jane.

14819
04:03:33,380 --> 04:03:34,500
She felt a solicitude.

14820
04:03:34,500 --> 04:03:35,120
On the subject,

14821
04:03:35,120 --> 04:03:36,060
which convinced her

14822
04:03:36,060 --> 04:03:37,260
on examination.

14823
04:03:37,280 --> 04:03:37,920
That she did not.

14824
04:03:37,920 --> 04:03:38,460
Consider

14825
04:03:38,460 --> 04:03:39,660
entirely hopeless.

14826
04:03:40,200 --> 04:03:41,400
It was possible,

14827
04:03:41,400 --> 04:03:42,180
and sometimes

14828
04:03:42,180 --> 04:03:43,380
she thought it probable

14829
04:03:43,620 --> 04:03:44,760
that his affection might

14830
04:03:44,760 --> 04:03:45,860
be reanimated

14831
04:03:45,860 --> 04:03:46,860
and the influence

14832
04:03:46,860 --> 04:03:47,480
of his friends

14833
04:03:47,480 --> 04:03:48,680
successfully

14834
04:03:48,800 --> 04:03:49,200
by the more

14835
04:03:49,200 --> 04:03:50,220
natural influence

14836
04:03:50,220 --> 04:03:51,440
of Jane's attractions.

14837
04:03:52,080 --> 04:03:52,700
Miss Bennet

14838
04:03:52,700 --> 04:03:53,280
accepted her

14839
04:03:53,280 --> 04:03:54,120
aunt's invitation

14840
04:03:54,120 --> 04:03:54,920
with pleasure,

14841
04:03:54,920 --> 04:03:55,680
and the Bengalis

14842
04:03:55,680 --> 04:03:56,520
were no otherwise

14843
04:03:56,520 --> 04:03:57,080
in her thoughts.

14844
04:03:57,080 --> 04:03:58,220
At the same time

14845
04:03:58,220 --> 04:03:58,980
then, as she hoped

14846
04:03:58,980 --> 04:04:00,200
by Caroline's not living

14847
04:04:00,200 --> 04:04:00,920
in the same house

14848
04:04:00,920 --> 04:04:01,760
with her brother,

14849
04:04:01,760 --> 04:04:02,780
she might occasionally

14850
04:04:02,780 --> 04:04:03,960
spend a morning with her

14851
04:04:03,960 --> 04:04:05,040
without any danger

14852
04:04:05,040 --> 04:04:06,240
of seeing him.

14853
04:04:06,620 --> 04:04:07,220
The gardener

14854
04:04:07,220 --> 04:04:08,480
stayed a at Long Bourne,

14855
04:04:08,720 --> 04:04:09,320
and what with

14856
04:04:09,320 --> 04:04:10,020
the Phillips's,

14857
04:04:10,020 --> 04:04:10,640
the Lucas's

14858
04:04:10,640 --> 04:04:11,600
and the officers.

14859
04:04:11,600 --> 04:04:12,480
There was not a day

14860
04:04:12,480 --> 04:04:13,680
without its engagement.

14861
04:04:14,040 --> 04:04:14,400
Mrs.

14862
04:04:14,400 --> 04:04:15,060
Bennet had so

14863
04:04:15,060 --> 04:04:15,980
carefully provided

14864
04:04:15,980 --> 04:04:16,820
for the entertainment

14865
04:04:16,820 --> 04:04:18,020
of her brother sister

14866
04:04:18,080 --> 04:04:19,020
that they did not want

14867
04:04:19,020 --> 04:04:19,520
sit down

14868
04:04:19,520 --> 04:04:20,720
to a family dinner

14869
04:04:21,000 --> 04:04:21,840
when the engagement

14870
04:04:21,840 --> 04:04:22,700
was for home.

14871
04:04:22,700 --> 04:04:23,700
Some of the officers

14872
04:04:23,700 --> 04:04:24,900
always made part of it,

14873
04:04:24,960 --> 04:04:26,180
of which officers Mr.

14874
04:04:26,180 --> 04:04:26,640
Wickham was

14875
04:04:26,640 --> 04:04:27,780
sure to be one.

14876
04:04:27,780 --> 04:04:28,140
And on

14877
04:04:28,140 --> 04:04:29,400
these occasions, Mrs.

14878
04:04:29,400 --> 04:04:30,080
Gardner,

14879
04:04:30,080 --> 04:04:31,160
rendered suspicious

14880
04:04:31,160 --> 04:04:32,160
by Elizabeth's warm

14881
04:04:32,160 --> 04:04:33,620
commendation, narrowly

14882
04:04:33,620 --> 04:04:34,820
observed them both

14883
04:04:35,060 --> 04:04:36,420
without supposing them

14884
04:04:36,420 --> 04:04:37,700
from what she saw, to be

14885
04:04:37,700 --> 04:04:39,000
very seriously in love.

14886
04:04:39,260 --> 04:04:40,080
Their preference

14887
04:04:40,080 --> 04:04:40,520
of each other

14888
04:04:40,520 --> 04:04:41,240
was plain enough

14889
04:04:41,240 --> 04:04:41,700
to make her

14890
04:04:41,700 --> 04:04:42,900
a little uneasy.

14891
04:04:42,900 --> 04:04:43,640
And she resolved to.

14892
04:04:43,640 --> 04:04:44,480
Speak to Elizabeth

14893
04:04:44,480 --> 04:04:45,080
on the subject

14894
04:04:45,080 --> 04:04:45,360
before

14895
04:04:45,360 --> 04:04:46,560
she left Hertfordshire

14896
04:04:46,640 --> 04:04:47,660
and represent to her,

14897
04:04:47,660 --> 04:04:48,380
the imprudence

14898
04:04:48,380 --> 04:04:49,100
of encouraging

14899
04:04:49,100 --> 04:04:50,300
such an attachment

14900
04:04:50,940 --> 04:04:51,440
to Mrs.

14901
04:04:51,440 --> 04:04:52,020
Gardner.

14902
04:04:52,020 --> 04:04:53,220
Wickham had one means

14903
04:04:53,220 --> 04:04:54,420
of affording pleasure

14904
04:04:54,420 --> 04:04:55,100
unconnected

14905
04:04:55,100 --> 04:04:56,300
with his general powers.

14906
04:04:56,640 --> 04:04:57,440
About ten

14907
04:04:57,440 --> 04:04:58,580
or a dozen years ago,

14908
04:04:58,580 --> 04:04:59,780
before her marriage,

14909
04:04:59,780 --> 04:05:00,480
she had spent

14910
04:05:00,480 --> 04:05:01,440
a considerable time

14911
04:05:01,440 --> 04:05:01,680
in that

14912
04:05:01,680 --> 04:05:03,000
very part of Derbyshire

14913
04:05:03,000 --> 04:05:04,200
to which she belonged.

14914
04:05:04,340 --> 04:05:05,300
They had therefore

14915
04:05:05,300 --> 04:05:06,180
many acquaintances

14916
04:05:06,180 --> 04:05:07,020
in common.

14917
04:05:07,020 --> 04:05:07,800
And though Wickham.

14918
04:05:07,800 --> 04:05:08,700
Had been little there

14919
04:05:08,700 --> 04:05:09,240
since the death

14920
04:05:09,240 --> 04:05:10,440
of Darcy's father,

14921
04:05:10,560 --> 04:05:11,760
it was yet in his power

14922
04:05:11,760 --> 04:05:12,560
to give her fresher

14923
04:05:12,560 --> 04:05:13,160
intelligence

14924
04:05:13,160 --> 04:05:14,360
of her former friends

14925
04:05:14,420 --> 04:05:14,900
than she had

14926
04:05:14,900 --> 04:05:15,480
been in the way

14927
04:05:15,480 --> 04:05:16,680
of procuring.

14928
04:05:16,740 --> 04:05:17,100
Mrs.

14929
04:05:17,100 --> 04:05:17,640
Gardner had

14930
04:05:17,640 --> 04:05:18,660
seen Pemberley

14931
04:05:18,660 --> 04:05:19,860
and known the late Mr.

14932
04:05:19,860 --> 04:05:20,940
Darcy by character

14933
04:05:20,940 --> 04:05:22,140
perfectly well.

14934
04:05:22,200 --> 04:05:23,220
Here, consequently

14935
04:05:23,220 --> 04:05:23,520
was an

14936
04:05:23,520 --> 04:05:24,660
inexhaustible subject

14937
04:05:24,660 --> 04:05:26,060
of discourse and

14938
04:05:26,060 --> 04:05:26,700
comparing her

14939
04:05:26,700 --> 04:05:27,320
recollection

14940
04:05:27,320 --> 04:05:27,900
of Pemberley

14941
04:05:27,900 --> 04:05:28,100
with the

14942
04:05:28,100 --> 04:05:29,060
minute description

14943
04:05:29,060 --> 04:05:29,540
which Wickham

14944
04:05:29,540 --> 04:05:30,300
could give.

14945
04:05:30,300 --> 04:05:31,220
And in bestowing her

14946
04:05:31,220 --> 04:05:32,060
tribute of praise

14947
04:05:32,060 --> 04:05:32,700
on the character

14948
04:05:32,700 --> 04:05:33,900
of its late possessor,

14949
04:05:34,100 --> 04:05:35,120
she was delighting both

14950
04:05:35,120 --> 04:05:36,620
him and herself

14951
04:05:37,020 --> 04:05:38,100
on being made acquainted

14952
04:05:38,100 --> 04:05:38,900
with the present Mr.

14953
04:05:38,900 --> 04:05:39,320
Darcy's

14954
04:05:39,320 --> 04:05:40,400
treatment of him.

14955
04:05:40,400 --> 04:05:41,340
She tried to remember

14956
04:05:41,340 --> 04:05:41,720
some of that

14957
04:05:41,720 --> 04:05:42,200
gentleman's

14958
04:05:42,200 --> 04:05:43,200
reputed disposition

14959
04:05:43,200 --> 04:05:44,180
when quite a lot

14960
04:05:44,180 --> 04:05:44,640
which might

14961
04:05:44,640 --> 04:05:45,540
agree with it

14962
04:05:45,540 --> 04:05:46,620
and was confident

14963
04:05:46,620 --> 04:05:47,120
last that

14964
04:05:47,120 --> 04:05:47,880
she recollected,

14965
04:05:47,880 --> 04:05:48,620
having heard Mr.

14966
04:05:48,620 --> 04:05:49,820
Fitzwilliam Darcy

14967
04:05:49,940 --> 04:05:51,380
formerly spoken of as a

14968
04:05:51,380 --> 04:05:52,220
very proud,

14969
04:05:52,220 --> 04:05:53,460
ill natured boy.

14970
04:05:56,520 --> 04:05:57,240
Chapter 20.

14971
04:05:57,240 --> 04:05:58,440
Six.

14972
04:05:59,100 --> 04:05:59,420
Mrs.

14973
04:05:59,420 --> 04:06:00,380
Gardiner's caution

14974
04:06:00,380 --> 04:06:00,980
to Elizabeth

14975
04:06:00,980 --> 04:06:01,760
was punctually

14976
04:06:01,760 --> 04:06:02,720
and kindly given

14977
04:06:02,720 --> 04:06:03,240
on the first

14978
04:06:03,240 --> 04:06:04,320
favorable opportunity

14979
04:06:04,320 --> 04:06:05,520
of speaking to alone

14980
04:06:05,880 --> 04:06:06,720
after honestly

14981
04:06:06,720 --> 04:06:07,200
telling her

14982
04:06:07,200 --> 04:06:08,060
what she thought.

14983
04:06:08,060 --> 04:06:09,260
She thus went on,

14984
04:06:10,040 --> 04:06:11,280
You are too sensible

14985
04:06:11,280 --> 04:06:11,900
a girl, Lizzie,

14986
04:06:11,900 --> 04:06:12,920
to fall in love merely

14987
04:06:12,920 --> 04:06:13,500
because you are

14988
04:06:13,500 --> 04:06:14,700
warned against it.

14989
04:06:14,720 --> 04:06:15,380
And therefore

14990
04:06:15,380 --> 04:06:16,160
I am not afraid of

14991
04:06:16,160 --> 04:06:17,360
speaking openly.

14992
04:06:17,720 --> 04:06:19,020
Seriously, I would have

14993
04:06:19,020 --> 04:06:20,220
you be on your guard.

14994
04:06:20,360 --> 04:06:21,200
Do not involve.

14995
04:06:21,200 --> 04:06:22,320
Yourself or endeavored

14996
04:06:22,320 --> 04:06:23,180
to involve him

14997
04:06:23,180 --> 04:06:24,260
in an affection.

14998
04:06:24,260 --> 04:06:25,440
Which the wonder fortune

14999
04:06:25,440 --> 04:06:25,760
would make

15000
04:06:25,760 --> 04:06:26,960
so very imprudent.

15001
04:06:27,300 --> 04:06:28,140
I have nothing to say

15002
04:06:28,140 --> 04:06:29,100
against him.

15003
04:06:29,100 --> 04:06:29,760
He is the most

15004
04:06:29,760 --> 04:06:30,960
interesting young man.

15005
04:06:30,960 --> 04:06:31,620
And if he had

15006
04:06:31,620 --> 04:06:32,180
the fortune,

15007
04:06:32,180 --> 04:06:33,360
he ought to have.

15008
04:06:33,360 --> 04:06:33,900
I should think

15009
04:06:33,900 --> 04:06:35,100
you could not do better.

15010
04:06:35,540 --> 04:06:36,300
But as it is,

15011
04:06:36,300 --> 04:06:36,800
you must not

15012
04:06:36,800 --> 04:06:37,880
let your fancy run away

15013
04:06:37,880 --> 04:06:38,660
with you.

15014
04:06:38,660 --> 04:06:39,680
You have sense,

15015
04:06:39,680 --> 04:06:40,700
and we all expect you

15016
04:06:40,700 --> 04:06:41,760
to use it.

15017
04:06:41,760 --> 04:06:42,900
Your father would depend

15018
04:06:42,900 --> 04:06:43,920
on your resolution.

15019
04:06:43,920 --> 04:06:44,640
Good conduct.

15020
04:06:44,640 --> 04:06:45,540
I am sure

15021
04:06:45,540 --> 04:06:46,620
he must not disappoint

15022
04:06:46,620 --> 04:06:47,820
your father.

15023
04:06:48,140 --> 04:06:49,340
My dear aunt,

15024
04:06:49,380 --> 04:06:50,640
this is being serious.

15025
04:06:50,640 --> 04:06:51,840
Indeed.

15026
04:06:52,080 --> 04:06:52,620
Yes.

15027
04:06:52,620 --> 04:06:53,820
And I hope to engage.

15028
04:06:53,900 --> 04:06:54,600
To be serious.

15029
04:06:54,600 --> 04:06:55,800
Likewise.

15030
04:06:56,220 --> 04:06:57,260
Well, then

15031
04:06:57,260 --> 04:06:58,320
you need not be under

15032
04:06:58,320 --> 04:06:59,460
any alarm.

15033
04:06:59,460 --> 04:07:00,480
I will take care of

15034
04:07:00,480 --> 04:07:01,680
myself and Mr.

15035
04:07:01,680 --> 04:07:02,600
Wickham too.

15036
04:07:02,600 --> 04:07:03,680
He shall not be in

15037
04:07:03,680 --> 04:07:04,320
love with me

15038
04:07:04,320 --> 04:07:05,660
if I can prevent it.

15039
04:07:06,580 --> 04:07:07,680
Elizabeth.

15040
04:07:07,680 --> 04:07:09,480
You are not serious now.

15041
04:07:10,220 --> 04:07:11,100
I beg your pardon?

15042
04:07:11,100 --> 04:07:12,200
I will try again.

15043
04:07:12,200 --> 04:07:12,900
At present,

15044
04:07:12,900 --> 04:07:13,700
I am not in love

15045
04:07:13,700 --> 04:07:14,600
with Mr. Wickham.

15046
04:07:14,600 --> 04:07:15,920
No, I certainly am not.

15047
04:07:16,380 --> 04:07:17,360
But he is beyond

15048
04:07:17,360 --> 04:07:18,080
all comparison,

15049
04:07:18,080 --> 04:07:19,020
the most agreeable man

15050
04:07:19,020 --> 04:07:20,160
I ever saw.

15051
04:07:20,160 --> 04:07:21,020
And if he becomes

15052
04:07:21,020 --> 04:07:22,220
really attached to me,

15053
04:07:22,440 --> 04:07:23,300
I believe it will be.

15054
04:07:23,300 --> 04:07:24,120
Better that he should.

15055
04:07:24,120 --> 04:07:24,780
Not.

15056
04:07:24,780 --> 04:07:25,980
I see the imprudence

15057
04:07:25,980 --> 04:07:26,960
of it.

15058
04:07:26,960 --> 04:07:27,420
How?

15059
04:07:27,420 --> 04:07:28,820
That abominable Mr.

15060
04:07:28,820 --> 04:07:29,600
Darcy.

15061
04:07:29,600 --> 04:07:30,360
My father's

15062
04:07:30,360 --> 04:07:31,080
opinion of me

15063
04:07:31,080 --> 04:07:31,980
does me the greatest.

15064
04:07:31,980 --> 04:07:32,540
Honor,

15065
04:07:32,540 --> 04:07:33,740
and I be miserable

15066
04:07:33,740 --> 04:07:34,820
forfeited.

15067
04:07:34,820 --> 04:07:35,420
My father,

15068
04:07:35,420 --> 04:07:35,880
however, is

15069
04:07:35,880 --> 04:07:36,620
partial to Mr.

15070
04:07:36,620 --> 04:07:37,380
Wickham.

15071
04:07:37,380 --> 04:07:38,780
In short, my dear aunt,

15072
04:07:38,780 --> 04:07:39,840
I should be very sorry

15073
04:07:39,840 --> 04:07:40,020
to be.

15074
04:07:40,020 --> 04:07:40,380
The means

15075
04:07:40,380 --> 04:07:41,240
of making any of you.

15076
04:07:41,240 --> 04:07:42,360
Unhappy.

15077
04:07:42,360 --> 04:07:42,960
But since.

15078
04:07:42,960 --> 04:07:43,940
We see every day

15079
04:07:43,940 --> 04:07:44,520
that where there is

15080
04:07:44,520 --> 04:07:45,320
affection, young

15081
04:07:45,320 --> 04:07:46,280
people are seldom

15082
04:07:46,280 --> 04:07:46,940
withheld by.

15083
04:07:46,940 --> 04:07:48,260
Immediate wonder fortune

15084
04:07:48,260 --> 04:07:48,780
from entering

15085
04:07:48,780 --> 04:07:49,560
into engagements

15086
04:07:49,560 --> 04:07:50,640
with each other.

15087
04:07:50,640 --> 04:07:51,540
How can I promise.

15088
04:07:51,540 --> 04:07:52,280
To be wiser

15089
04:07:52,280 --> 04:07:52,640
than so

15090
04:07:52,640 --> 04:07:53,120
many of my

15091
04:07:53,120 --> 04:07:53,900
fellow creatures

15092
04:07:53,900 --> 04:07:54,300
if I am.

15093
04:07:54,300 --> 04:07:55,280
Tempted?

15094
04:07:55,280 --> 04:07:55,460
Well,

15095
04:07:55,460 --> 04:07:56,420
how am I even to know

15096
04:07:56,420 --> 04:07:57,140
that it would be wisdom

15097
04:07:57,140 --> 04:07:58,280
to resist?

15098
04:07:58,280 --> 04:07:59,340
All that I can promise

15099
04:07:59,340 --> 04:08:00,080
you, therefore, is

15100
04:08:00,080 --> 04:08:01,460
not to be in a hurry.

15101
04:08:01,760 --> 04:08:02,960
I will not be in a hurry

15102
04:08:02,960 --> 04:08:03,860
to believe myself.

15103
04:08:03,860 --> 04:08:05,060
His first object.

15104
04:08:05,520 --> 04:08:06,420
When I am in company

15105
04:08:06,420 --> 04:08:06,840
with him,

15106
04:08:06,840 --> 04:08:08,040
I will not be wishing.

15107
04:08:08,160 --> 04:08:09,020
In short,

15108
04:08:09,020 --> 04:08:10,280
I will do my best.

15109
04:08:11,420 --> 04:08:12,120
Perhaps it

15110
04:08:12,120 --> 04:08:12,780
would be as well

15111
04:08:12,780 --> 04:08:13,560
if you discourages

15112
04:08:13,560 --> 04:08:14,000
coming here

15113
04:08:14,000 --> 04:08:15,200
so very often.

15114
04:08:15,200 --> 04:08:15,800
At least

15115
04:08:15,800 --> 04:08:16,760
you should not remind

15116
04:08:16,760 --> 04:08:17,220
your mother

15117
04:08:17,220 --> 04:08:18,420
of inviting him

15118
04:08:19,080 --> 04:08:20,220
as I did the.

15119
04:08:20,220 --> 04:08:21,200
Other day,

15120
04:08:21,200 --> 04:08:22,080
said Elizabeth,

15121
04:08:22,080 --> 04:08:23,280
a conscious smile.

15122
04:08:23,420 --> 04:08:24,320
Very true.

15123
04:08:24,320 --> 04:08:25,520
It will be wise in me

15124
04:08:25,520 --> 04:08:26,720
to refrain from that.

15125
04:08:27,080 --> 04:08:28,160
But do not imagine that

15126
04:08:28,160 --> 04:08:28,880
he is always here

15127
04:08:28,880 --> 04:08:29,700
so often.

15128
04:08:29,700 --> 04:08:30,600
It is on your account

15129
04:08:30,600 --> 04:08:31,100
that he has been

15130
04:08:31,100 --> 04:08:32,540
so frequently this week.

15131
04:08:32,960 --> 04:08:33,320
You know.

15132
04:08:33,320 --> 04:08:34,260
My mother's ideas

15133
04:08:34,260 --> 04:08:35,120
as to the necessity.

15134
04:08:35,120 --> 04:08:36,240
Of constant company

15135
04:08:36,240 --> 04:08:37,440
for her friends.

15136
04:08:37,620 --> 04:08:38,240
But really,

15137
04:08:38,240 --> 04:08:39,140
and upon my honor,

15138
04:08:39,140 --> 04:08:39,960
I will try to do what

15139
04:08:39,960 --> 04:08:40,220
I think

15140
04:08:40,220 --> 04:08:41,420
to be the wisest.

15141
04:08:41,580 --> 04:08:42,420
And now I hope

15142
04:08:42,420 --> 04:08:43,620
you are satisfied.

15143
04:08:44,520 --> 04:08:45,600
Her aunt assured her

15144
04:08:45,600 --> 04:08:46,520
that she was.

15145
04:08:46,520 --> 04:08:47,220
And Elizabeth,

15146
04:08:47,220 --> 04:08:47,940
having thanked her

15147
04:08:47,940 --> 04:08:48,560
for the kindness

15148
04:08:48,560 --> 04:08:49,380
of her, hence

15149
04:08:49,380 --> 04:08:50,480
they parted

15150
04:08:50,480 --> 04:08:51,620
a wonderful instance

15151
04:08:51,620 --> 04:08:52,160
of advice

15152
04:08:52,160 --> 04:08:52,620
being given

15153
04:08:52,620 --> 04:08:53,540
on such a point

15154
04:08:53,540 --> 04:08:54,980
without being resented.

15155
04:08:55,320 --> 04:08:55,680
Mr.

15156
04:08:55,680 --> 04:08:56,180
Collins

15157
04:08:56,180 --> 04:08:56,760
returned in

15158
04:08:56,760 --> 04:08:57,500
to Hertfordshire

15159
04:08:57,500 --> 04:08:58,560
soon after it had been

15160
04:08:58,560 --> 04:08:58,920
committed

15161
04:08:58,920 --> 04:08:59,660
by the gardeners

15162
04:08:59,660 --> 04:09:00,600
and Jane.

15163
04:09:00,600 --> 04:09:01,500
But he took up his

15164
04:09:01,500 --> 04:09:01,980
abode with the.

15165
04:09:01,980 --> 04:09:03,440
Lucca says his arrival

15166
04:09:03,440 --> 04:09:04,060
was no great

15167
04:09:04,060 --> 04:09:05,120
inconvenience to Mrs.

15168
04:09:05,120 --> 04:09:05,840
Bennett.

15169
04:09:05,840 --> 04:09:06,840
His marriage was now

15170
04:09:06,840 --> 04:09:07,920
fast approaching,

15171
04:09:07,920 --> 04:09:09,020
and she was at length

15172
04:09:09,020 --> 04:09:09,960
so far, resigned

15173
04:09:09,960 --> 04:09:10,380
as to think

15174
04:09:10,380 --> 04:09:11,280
it inevitable.

15175
04:09:11,280 --> 04:09:12,440
And even repeatedly to.

15176
04:09:12,440 --> 04:09:13,020
Say in

15177
04:09:13,020 --> 04:09:14,120
an ill natured tone

15178
04:09:14,120 --> 04:09:14,900
that she.

15179
04:09:14,900 --> 04:09:15,500
Wished

15180
04:09:15,500 --> 04:09:16,700
they might be happy.

15181
04:09:17,400 --> 04:09:18,000
Thursday

15182
04:09:18,000 --> 04:09:18,440
was to be the

15183
04:09:18,440 --> 04:09:19,200
wedding day.

15184
04:09:19,200 --> 04:09:20,100
And on Wednesday,

15185
04:09:20,100 --> 04:09:21,000
Miss Lucas paid

15186
04:09:21,000 --> 04:09:21,980
farewell visit.

15187
04:09:21,980 --> 04:09:22,700
And when she rose

15188
04:09:22,700 --> 04:09:23,700
to take leave,

15189
04:09:23,700 --> 04:09:24,740
Elizabeth, ashamed

15190
04:09:24,740 --> 04:09:25,280
of her mother's

15191
04:09:25,280 --> 04:09:25,940
ungracious

15192
04:09:25,940 --> 04:09:26,540
and reluctant

15193
04:09:26,540 --> 04:09:27,480
good wishes,

15194
04:09:27,480 --> 04:09:28,400
sincerely affected

15195
04:09:28,400 --> 04:09:29,220
herself,

15196
04:09:29,220 --> 04:09:29,880
accompanied her

15197
04:09:29,880 --> 04:09:30,900
out of the room

15198
04:09:30,900 --> 04:09:31,920
as they went downstairs

15199
04:09:31,920 --> 04:09:32,300
together,

15200
04:09:32,300 --> 04:09:33,500
Charlotte said.

15201
04:09:33,720 --> 04:09:34,520
I shall depend.

15202
04:09:34,520 --> 04:09:35,240
On hearing from you

15203
04:09:35,240 --> 04:09:35,840
very often.

15204
04:09:35,840 --> 04:09:37,040
Eliza.

15205
04:09:37,100 --> 04:09:37,620
That you.

15206
04:09:37,620 --> 04:09:38,820
Certainly shall.

15207
04:09:39,440 --> 04:09:40,080
And I

15208
04:09:40,080 --> 04:09:40,500
have another

15209
04:09:40,500 --> 04:09:41,700
favor to ask you.

15210
04:09:41,880 --> 04:09:42,320
Will you come

15211
04:09:42,320 --> 04:09:43,520
and see me?

15212
04:09:43,740 --> 04:09:44,780
We shall often meet,

15213
04:09:44,780 --> 04:09:45,140
I hope,

15214
04:09:45,140 --> 04:09:46,340
in Hertfordshire.

15215
04:09:46,800 --> 04:09:48,000
I am not likely to.

15216
04:09:48,000 --> 04:09:48,200
Leave

15217
04:09:48,200 --> 04:09:49,400
Kent for some time.

15218
04:09:49,940 --> 04:09:50,520
Promise Me

15219
04:09:50,520 --> 04:09:51,140
therefore, to come

15220
04:09:51,140 --> 04:09:52,340
to Hansford.

15221
04:09:52,700 --> 04:09:53,460
Elizabeth could.

15222
04:09:53,460 --> 04:09:54,560
Not refuse.

15223
04:09:54,560 --> 04:09:54,800
Though

15224
04:09:54,800 --> 04:09:55,400
she foresaw

15225
04:09:55,400 --> 04:09:56,160
little pleasure

15226
04:09:56,160 --> 04:09:57,360
in the visit.

15227
04:09:57,560 --> 04:09:58,960
My father and Maria

15228
04:09:58,960 --> 04:09:59,480
are coming to me

15229
04:09:59,480 --> 04:10:00,360
in March,

15230
04:10:00,360 --> 04:10:01,560
added Charlotte.

15231
04:10:01,700 --> 04:10:02,180
And I hope

15232
04:10:02,180 --> 04:10:02,780
you have consented

15233
04:10:02,780 --> 04:10:03,980
to be of the party.

15234
04:10:04,160 --> 04:10:05,360
Indeed, Eliza,

15235
04:10:05,640 --> 04:10:06,560
you will be as welcome

15236
04:10:06,560 --> 04:10:07,760
as either of them.

15237
04:10:08,100 --> 04:10:09,300
The wedding took place.

15238
04:10:09,540 --> 04:10:10,800
The bride and bridegroom

15239
04:10:10,800 --> 04:10:11,160
set off

15240
04:10:11,160 --> 04:10:11,600
for Kent

15241
04:10:11,600 --> 04:10:12,720
from the church door.

15242
04:10:12,720 --> 04:10:13,700
And everybody had

15243
04:10:13,700 --> 04:10:14,580
as much to say

15244
04:10:14,580 --> 04:10:15,200
or to hear

15245
04:10:15,200 --> 04:10:15,920
on the subject,

15246
04:10:15,920 --> 04:10:17,060
as usual.

15247
04:10:17,060 --> 04:10:17,880
Elizabeth soon

15248
04:10:17,880 --> 04:10:19,040
heard from her friend

15249
04:10:19,040 --> 04:10:20,180
and their correspondence

15250
04:10:20,180 --> 04:10:20,960
was as regular

15251
04:10:20,960 --> 04:10:21,660
and frequent

15252
04:10:21,660 --> 04:10:22,860
as it had ever been.

15253
04:10:22,880 --> 04:10:23,520
That it should be

15254
04:10:23,520 --> 04:10:24,780
equally unreserved

15255
04:10:24,780 --> 04:10:25,980
was impossible.

15256
04:10:26,120 --> 04:10:27,120
Elizabeth could never

15257
04:10:27,120 --> 04:10:27,600
address her

15258
04:10:27,600 --> 04:10:28,280
without feeling

15259
04:10:28,280 --> 04:10:28,640
that all

15260
04:10:28,640 --> 04:10:29,300
the comfort of

15261
04:10:29,300 --> 04:10:30,500
intimacy was over,

15262
04:10:30,720 --> 04:10:31,680
and they were determined

15263
04:10:31,680 --> 04:10:32,420
not to slacken.

15264
04:10:32,420 --> 04:10:33,620
As a correspondent.

15265
04:10:33,680 --> 04:10:34,760
It was for the sake of

15266
04:10:34,760 --> 04:10:35,960
what had been rather

15267
04:10:35,960 --> 04:10:37,160
than what was.

15268
04:10:37,320 --> 04:10:38,180
Charlotte's first

15269
04:10:38,180 --> 04:10:39,160
letters were received

15270
04:10:39,160 --> 04:10:39,480
with a good

15271
04:10:39,480 --> 04:10:40,680
deal of eagerness.

15272
04:10:40,740 --> 04:10:41,460
There could not

15273
04:10:41,460 --> 04:10:42,480
but be curiosity

15274
04:10:42,480 --> 04:10:42,720
to know.

15275
04:10:42,720 --> 04:10:43,100
How she would

15276
04:10:43,100 --> 04:10:44,300
speak of her new home,

15277
04:10:44,340 --> 04:10:44,760
how she.

15278
04:10:44,760 --> 04:10:45,120
Would like

15279
04:10:45,120 --> 04:10:46,040
Lady Katharine,

15280
04:10:46,040 --> 04:10:46,880
and how happy

15281
04:10:46,880 --> 04:10:47,360
she would dare

15282
04:10:47,360 --> 04:10:48,200
pronounce herself to.

15283
04:10:48,200 --> 04:10:49,020
Be.

15284
04:10:49,020 --> 04:10:49,500
Though

15285
04:10:49,500 --> 04:10:50,100
When the letters

15286
04:10:50,100 --> 04:10:50,880
were read,

15287
04:10:50,880 --> 04:10:51,600
Elizabeth felt

15288
04:10:51,600 --> 04:10:52,100
that Charlotte

15289
04:10:52,100 --> 04:10:52,920
expressed herself

15290
04:10:52,920 --> 04:10:54,300
on every point exactly

15291
04:10:54,300 --> 04:10:54,720
as she might

15292
04:10:54,720 --> 04:10:55,920
have foreseen.

15293
04:10:55,920 --> 04:10:57,120
She wrote cheerfully,

15294
04:10:57,200 --> 04:10:58,100
seemed surrounded

15295
04:10:58,100 --> 04:10:59,000
with comforts

15296
04:10:59,000 --> 04:11:00,080
and, mentioned nothing,

15297
04:11:00,080 --> 04:11:00,360
which she

15298
04:11:00,360 --> 04:11:01,560
could not praise.

15299
04:11:01,640 --> 04:11:02,780
The house, furniture

15300
04:11:02,780 --> 04:11:03,480
and neighborhood

15301
04:11:03,480 --> 04:11:04,080
and roads

15302
04:11:04,080 --> 04:11:05,280
were all to her taste.

15303
04:11:05,400 --> 04:11:06,300
And Lady Katherine's

15304
04:11:06,300 --> 04:11:06,780
behavior

15305
04:11:06,780 --> 04:11:07,740
was most friendly

15306
04:11:07,740 --> 04:11:08,940
and obliging.

15307
04:11:08,960 --> 04:11:09,560
It Was Mr.

15308
04:11:09,560 --> 04:11:10,400
Collins picture

15309
04:11:10,400 --> 04:11:11,580
of Hansford and Roses

15310
04:11:11,580 --> 04:11:12,780
rationally softened

15311
04:11:12,980 --> 04:11:13,940
and Elizabeth perceived

15312
04:11:13,940 --> 04:11:14,400
that she must

15313
04:11:14,400 --> 04:11:15,120
wait for her own

15314
04:11:15,120 --> 04:11:15,840
visit there to

15315
04:11:15,840 --> 04:11:16,580
know the rest.

15316
04:11:17,600 --> 04:11:18,740
Jane had already written

15317
04:11:18,740 --> 04:11:19,500
few lines to her

15318
04:11:19,500 --> 04:11:20,280
sister to announce

15319
04:11:20,280 --> 04:11:20,660
their safe

15320
04:11:20,660 --> 04:11:21,860
arrival in London.

15321
04:11:21,900 --> 04:11:22,380
And when she

15322
04:11:22,380 --> 04:11:23,120
wrote again.

15323
04:11:23,120 --> 04:11:23,880
Elizabeth hoped

15324
04:11:23,880 --> 04:11:24,660
it would be in her power

15325
04:11:24,660 --> 04:11:24,920
to say

15326
04:11:24,920 --> 04:11:25,380
something of

15327
04:11:25,380 --> 04:11:26,400
the Baileys.

15328
04:11:26,400 --> 04:11:27,260
Her impatience

15329
04:11:27,260 --> 04:11:27,560
for the

15330
04:11:27,560 --> 04:11:28,280
second letter

15331
04:11:28,280 --> 04:11:29,300
was as well rewarded

15332
04:11:29,300 --> 04:11:29,960
as impatience

15333
04:11:29,960 --> 04:11:31,160
generally is.

15334
04:11:31,280 --> 04:11:32,060
Jane had been

15335
04:11:32,060 --> 04:11:32,760
a week in town

15336
04:11:32,760 --> 04:11:33,360
without either

15337
04:11:33,360 --> 04:11:34,320
seeing or hearing

15338
04:11:34,320 --> 04:11:35,480
from Caroline.

15339
04:11:35,480 --> 04:11:36,380
She accounted for

15340
04:11:36,380 --> 04:11:36,800
it, however,

15341
04:11:36,800 --> 04:11:37,520
by supposing that

15342
04:11:37,520 --> 04:11:38,780
her last to her friend

15343
04:11:38,780 --> 04:11:40,020
from long born had,

15344
04:11:40,020 --> 04:11:41,060
by some accident,

15345
04:11:41,060 --> 04:11:42,260
been lost.

15346
04:11:42,600 --> 04:11:43,440
My aunt,

15347
04:11:43,440 --> 04:11:44,520
she continued,

15348
04:11:44,520 --> 04:11:45,380
is going to morrow

15349
04:11:45,380 --> 04:11:45,960
and to that part

15350
04:11:45,960 --> 04:11:46,760
of the town,

15351
04:11:46,760 --> 04:11:47,420
and I shall take

15352
04:11:47,420 --> 04:11:48,140
the opportunity

15353
04:11:48,140 --> 04:11:48,680
of calling.

15354
04:11:48,680 --> 04:11:49,880
In Grosvenor Street.

15355
04:11:50,520 --> 04:11:51,260
She wrote again

15356
04:11:51,260 --> 04:11:52,460
when the visit was paid,

15357
04:11:52,500 --> 04:11:53,280
and she had seen

15358
04:11:53,280 --> 04:11:54,480
Miss Bingley.

15359
04:11:54,660 --> 04:11:55,440
I did not think

15360
04:11:55,440 --> 04:11:56,660
Caroline and spirits.

15361
04:11:56,880 --> 04:11:58,020
Were her words.

15362
04:11:58,020 --> 04:11:58,800
But she was very glad

15363
04:11:58,800 --> 04:11:59,640
to see me

15364
04:11:59,640 --> 04:12:00,440
and reproached me

15365
04:12:00,440 --> 04:12:00,860
for giving her

15366
04:12:00,860 --> 04:12:01,520
no notice of my

15367
04:12:01,520 --> 04:12:02,720
coming to London.

15368
04:12:02,900 --> 04:12:03,800
I was right there

15369
04:12:03,800 --> 04:12:04,520
for my last

15370
04:12:04,520 --> 04:12:04,940
letter had

15371
04:12:04,940 --> 04:12:06,140
never reached her.

15372
04:12:06,200 --> 04:12:07,220
I inquired after that

15373
04:12:07,220 --> 04:12:08,420
brother course.

15374
04:12:08,540 --> 04:12:09,560
He was. Well.

15375
04:12:09,560 --> 04:12:10,580
But so much engaged.

15376
04:12:10,580 --> 04:12:10,920
With Mr.

15377
04:12:10,920 --> 04:12:11,400
Darcy

15378
04:12:11,400 --> 04:12:12,080
that they scarcely.

15379
04:12:12,080 --> 04:12:13,280
Ever saw him.

15380
04:12:13,340 --> 04:12:14,480
I found that Mr.

15381
04:12:14,480 --> 04:12:14,780
C was

15382
04:12:14,780 --> 04:12:15,980
expected to dinner.

15383
04:12:16,140 --> 04:12:17,340
I wish I could see her.

15384
04:12:17,880 --> 04:12:19,140
My visit was not long

15385
04:12:19,440 --> 04:12:20,520
as Caroline and Mrs..

15386
04:12:20,520 --> 04:12:21,720
Her still going out.

15387
04:12:22,020 --> 04:12:22,640
I daresay

15388
04:12:22,640 --> 04:12:23,480
I shall see them soon.

15389
04:12:23,480 --> 04:12:24,680
Here.

15390
04:12:24,680 --> 04:12:25,560
Elizabeth shook her

15391
04:12:25,560 --> 04:12:26,760
head over this letter.

15392
04:12:27,000 --> 04:12:28,520
It her that accident

15393
04:12:28,520 --> 04:12:29,460
only could discover

15394
04:12:29,460 --> 04:12:29,820
to Mr.

15395
04:12:29,820 --> 04:12:30,360
Bingley, her

15396
04:12:30,360 --> 04:12:31,640
sisters being in town.

15397
04:12:32,720 --> 04:12:34,100
Four weeks passed away.

15398
04:12:34,260 --> 04:12:34,940
And Jane.

15399
04:12:34,940 --> 04:12:36,140
Saw nothing of him.

15400
04:12:36,260 --> 04:12:36,860
She endeavored

15401
04:12:36,860 --> 04:12:37,700
to persuade

15402
04:12:37,700 --> 04:12:38,060
that she did

15403
04:12:38,060 --> 04:12:39,060
not regret it.

15404
04:12:39,060 --> 04:12:39,980
But she could no longer

15405
04:12:39,980 --> 04:12:41,180
be blind to Miss Bingley

15406
04:12:41,300 --> 04:12:42,440
and attention.

15407
04:12:42,440 --> 04:12:43,580
After waiting at home

15408
04:12:43,580 --> 04:12:44,280
every morning

15409
04:12:44,280 --> 04:12:45,240
for a fortnight

15410
04:12:45,240 --> 04:12:45,920
and inventing

15411
04:12:45,920 --> 04:12:46,640
every evening

15412
04:12:46,640 --> 04:12:47,840
a fresh excuse for her,

15413
04:12:48,120 --> 04:12:48,720
the visitor,

15414
04:12:48,720 --> 04:12:49,920
did it last appear?

15415
04:12:50,180 --> 04:12:50,900
But the shortness

15416
04:12:50,900 --> 04:12:52,260
of her stay, and yet

15417
04:12:52,260 --> 04:12:53,660
more the alteration

15418
04:12:53,660 --> 04:12:54,200
of her manner

15419
04:12:54,200 --> 04:12:54,920
would allow Jane

15420
04:12:54,920 --> 04:12:55,800
to deceive herself

15421
04:12:55,800 --> 04:12:57,000
no longer.

15422
04:12:57,000 --> 04:12:57,440
The letter,

15423
04:12:57,440 --> 04:12:57,960
which she wrote

15424
04:12:57,960 --> 04:12:58,580
on this occasion

15425
04:12:58,580 --> 04:12:59,420
to her sister,

15426
04:12:59,420 --> 04:13:00,060
will prove

15427
04:13:00,060 --> 04:13:01,260
what she felt.

15428
04:13:01,320 --> 04:13:02,700
My dearest Lizzie will,

15429
04:13:02,700 --> 04:13:04,140
I am sure, be incapable

15430
04:13:04,140 --> 04:13:04,800
of triumphing

15431
04:13:04,800 --> 04:13:05,720
in her better judgment

15432
04:13:05,720 --> 04:13:06,920
at my expense.

15433
04:13:06,980 --> 04:13:07,260
When I.

15434
04:13:07,260 --> 04:13:08,100
Confess myself

15435
04:13:08,100 --> 04:13:08,460
to have been

15436
04:13:08,460 --> 04:13:09,540
entirely deceived

15437
04:13:09,540 --> 04:13:09,800
in this

15438
04:13:09,800 --> 04:13:10,580
being these regard.

15439
04:13:10,580 --> 04:13:11,640
For me.

15440
04:13:11,640 --> 04:13:12,840
But my dear sister,

15441
04:13:13,200 --> 04:13:13,460
though

15442
04:13:13,460 --> 04:13:14,480
the event has proved

15443
04:13:14,480 --> 04:13:15,320
you right.

15444
04:13:15,320 --> 04:13:16,020
Do not think.

15445
04:13:16,020 --> 04:13:16,780
Be obstinate.

15446
04:13:16,780 --> 04:13:17,300
If I still.

15447
04:13:17,300 --> 04:13:18,440
Assert that.

15448
04:13:18,440 --> 04:13:19,220
Considering what

15449
04:13:19,220 --> 04:13:20,420
her behavior was,

15450
04:13:20,420 --> 04:13:21,320
my confidence

15451
04:13:21,320 --> 04:13:22,100
was as natural

15452
04:13:22,100 --> 04:13:23,300
as your suspicion.

15453
04:13:23,580 --> 04:13:24,420
I do not at all

15454
04:13:24,420 --> 04:13:25,440
comprehend her reason

15455
04:13:25,440 --> 04:13:25,860
for wishing

15456
04:13:25,860 --> 04:13:26,600
to be intimate with.

15457
04:13:26,600 --> 04:13:27,240
Me.

15458
04:13:27,240 --> 04:13:27,900
But if the same

15459
04:13:27,900 --> 04:13:28,820
circumstances

15460
04:13:28,820 --> 04:13:30,020
were to happen again,

15461
04:13:30,060 --> 04:13:30,680
I am sure I should

15462
04:13:30,680 --> 04:13:31,880
be deceived again.

15463
04:13:31,980 --> 04:13:33,180
Caroline did not return.

15464
04:13:33,180 --> 04:13:33,780
My visit till.

15465
04:13:33,780 --> 04:13:34,640
Yesterday.

15466
04:13:34,640 --> 04:13:35,820
And not a note.

15467
04:13:35,820 --> 04:13:37,220
Not a line did I receive

15468
04:13:37,220 --> 04:13:38,420
in the meantime.

15469
04:13:38,460 --> 04:13:39,660
When she did come,

15470
04:13:39,660 --> 04:13:40,640
it was very evident.

15471
04:13:40,640 --> 04:13:41,360
That she had no

15472
04:13:41,360 --> 04:13:42,320
pleasure in it.

15473
04:13:42,320 --> 04:13:43,220
She made a slight.

15474
04:13:43,220 --> 04:13:44,220
Formal apology

15475
04:13:44,220 --> 04:13:45,420
for not calling before.

15476
04:13:45,660 --> 04:13:46,080
Said not

15477
04:13:46,080 --> 04:13:46,760
a word of wishing

15478
04:13:46,760 --> 04:13:47,960
to see me again

15479
04:13:47,960 --> 04:13:49,400
and was in every respect

15480
04:13:49,400 --> 04:13:50,700
so altered a creature

15481
04:13:50,960 --> 04:13:52,100
that when she went away

15482
04:13:52,100 --> 04:13:53,360
I was perfectly resolved

15483
04:13:53,360 --> 04:13:53,840
to continue

15484
04:13:53,840 --> 04:13:54,480
the acquaintance

15485
04:13:54,480 --> 04:13:55,680
no longer.

15486
04:13:55,760 --> 04:13:56,900
I pity, though

15487
04:13:56,900 --> 04:13:57,680
I cannot help

15488
04:13:57,680 --> 04:13:58,880
blaming her.

15489
04:13:58,920 --> 04:13:59,900
She was very wrong

15490
04:13:59,900 --> 04:14:00,740
in singling me out

15491
04:14:00,740 --> 04:14:01,680
as she did.

15492
04:14:01,680 --> 04:14:02,700
I can safely say

15493
04:14:02,700 --> 04:14:03,780
that every advanced.

15494
04:14:03,780 --> 04:14:04,760
Intimacy began

15495
04:14:04,760 --> 04:14:05,960
on her side.

15496
04:14:06,200 --> 04:14:07,380
But I pity her

15497
04:14:07,380 --> 04:14:08,360
because she must feel

15498
04:14:08,360 --> 04:14:08,780
that she is

15499
04:14:08,780 --> 04:14:09,980
being acting wrong.

15500
04:14:10,020 --> 04:14:10,620
And because I am

15501
04:14:10,620 --> 04:14:11,100
very sure

15502
04:14:11,100 --> 04:14:12,120
that anxiety for her.

15503
04:14:12,120 --> 04:14:12,600
Brother is.

15504
04:14:12,600 --> 04:14:13,800
The cause of it.

15505
04:14:13,880 --> 04:14:14,520
I need not.

15506
04:14:14,520 --> 04:14:15,740
Explain myself further.

15507
04:14:16,040 --> 04:14:16,460
And though

15508
04:14:16,460 --> 04:14:17,600
we know this anxiety

15509
04:14:17,600 --> 04:14:18,800
to be quite needless.

15510
04:14:18,920 --> 04:14:20,400
Yet if she feels it,

15511
04:14:20,600 --> 04:14:21,840
it will easily account

15512
04:14:21,840 --> 04:14:23,040
for her behavior to me

15513
04:14:23,340 --> 04:14:24,440
and so deservedly

15514
04:14:24,440 --> 04:14:25,640
dear as he is to his.

15515
04:14:26,120 --> 04:14:27,180
Whatever anxiety

15516
04:14:27,180 --> 04:14:27,800
she must feel on

15517
04:14:27,800 --> 04:14:28,380
his behalf

15518
04:14:28,380 --> 04:14:29,760
is natural and amiable.

15519
04:14:30,200 --> 04:14:30,780
I cannot.

15520
04:14:30,780 --> 04:14:31,380
But one day,

15521
04:14:31,380 --> 04:14:32,160
however, it her

15522
04:14:32,160 --> 04:14:32,960
having any such

15523
04:14:32,960 --> 04:14:34,020
fears now,

15524
04:14:34,020 --> 04:14:34,700
because if he did

15525
04:14:34,700 --> 04:14:35,900
or cared about me,

15526
04:14:35,940 --> 04:14:36,800
we must have met

15527
04:14:36,800 --> 04:14:38,000
long ago.

15528
04:14:38,040 --> 04:14:38,760
He knows of my

15529
04:14:38,760 --> 04:14:39,440
being in town.

15530
04:14:39,440 --> 04:14:40,340
I am certain

15531
04:14:40,340 --> 04:14:40,940
from something

15532
04:14:40,940 --> 04:14:42,140
she said herself.

15533
04:14:42,260 --> 04:14:43,260
And yet it would seem

15534
04:14:43,260 --> 04:14:44,460
by her manner of talking

15535
04:14:44,720 --> 04:14:45,480
as if she wanted

15536
04:14:45,480 --> 04:14:46,340
to persuade herself.

15537
04:14:46,340 --> 04:14:46,700
That he is

15538
04:14:46,700 --> 04:14:47,720
really partial to Miss.

15539
04:14:47,720 --> 04:14:48,920
Darcy.

15540
04:14:49,020 --> 04:14:50,280
I cannot understand it

15541
04:14:50,700 --> 04:14:51,600
if I were not afraid

15542
04:14:51,600 --> 04:14:52,800
of judging harshly.

15543
04:14:53,120 --> 04:14:54,080
I should be almost

15544
04:14:54,080 --> 04:14:54,980
tempted to say

15545
04:14:54,980 --> 04:14:55,320
there is a

15546
04:14:55,320 --> 04:14:56,060
strong appearance

15547
04:14:56,060 --> 04:14:56,820
of duplicity

15548
04:14:56,820 --> 04:14:58,560
in all this, but I.

15549
04:14:58,560 --> 04:14:58,980
Will endeavor

15550
04:14:58,980 --> 04:14:59,640
to banish every.

15551
04:14:59,640 --> 04:15:00,600
Painful thought

15552
04:15:00,600 --> 04:15:01,680
and think only of what

15553
04:15:01,680 --> 04:15:02,880
will make me happy.

15554
04:15:03,020 --> 04:15:04,140
Your affection

15555
04:15:04,140 --> 04:15:04,520
and the

15556
04:15:04,520 --> 04:15:05,660
invariable kindness

15557
04:15:05,660 --> 04:15:06,200
of my dear

15558
04:15:06,200 --> 04:15:07,400
aunt and uncle.

15559
04:15:07,760 --> 04:15:08,640
Let me hear from you

15560
04:15:08,640 --> 04:15:09,840
very soon.

15561
04:15:09,840 --> 04:15:10,440
Mr. Bingley.

15562
04:15:10,440 --> 04:15:11,160
Said something of his

15563
04:15:11,160 --> 04:15:11,720
never returning

15564
04:15:11,720 --> 04:15:12,240
to Netherfield.

15565
04:15:12,240 --> 04:15:12,860
Again,

15566
04:15:12,860 --> 04:15:14,060
of giving up the house,

15567
04:15:14,060 --> 04:15:14,640
but not with

15568
04:15:14,640 --> 04:15:15,840
any certainty.

15569
04:15:15,900 --> 04:15:16,460
We had better

15570
04:15:16,460 --> 04:15:17,660
not mention it.

15571
04:15:17,660 --> 04:15:18,480
I am extremely.

15572
04:15:18,480 --> 04:15:19,140
Glad that you have

15573
04:15:19,140 --> 04:15:20,100
such pleasant accounts

15574
04:15:20,100 --> 04:15:20,820
from our friends at.

15575
04:15:20,820 --> 04:15:21,960
Hansford.

15576
04:15:21,960 --> 04:15:22,280
Pray.

15577
04:15:22,280 --> 04:15:23,280
Go to see them with Sir

15578
04:15:23,280 --> 04:15:24,480
William and Maria.

15579
04:15:24,540 --> 04:15:24,960
I am sure

15580
04:15:24,960 --> 04:15:25,160
he will be

15581
04:15:25,160 --> 04:15:26,360
very comfortable there.

15582
04:15:26,780 --> 04:15:27,980
Yours, etc..

15583
04:15:28,560 --> 04:15:29,340
This letter gave

15584
04:15:29,340 --> 04:15:30,540
Elizabeth some pain,

15585
04:15:30,680 --> 04:15:31,920
but her spirits returned

15586
04:15:31,920 --> 04:15:32,540
as she considered

15587
04:15:32,540 --> 04:15:33,080
the chain would

15588
04:15:33,080 --> 04:15:33,680
be no longer

15589
04:15:33,680 --> 04:15:34,800
duped by the sister

15590
04:15:34,800 --> 04:15:35,900
at least.

15591
04:15:35,900 --> 04:15:36,860
All expectation

15592
04:15:36,860 --> 04:15:37,400
from the brother

15593
04:15:37,400 --> 04:15:38,880
was now absolutely over.

15594
04:15:39,020 --> 04:15:40,160
She would not even wish

15595
04:15:40,160 --> 04:15:40,440
for a.

15596
04:15:40,440 --> 04:15:40,880
Renewal

15597
04:15:40,880 --> 04:15:42,080
of his attentions.

15598
04:15:42,200 --> 04:15:42,900
His character

15599
04:15:42,900 --> 04:15:44,160
sunk on every review

15600
04:15:44,160 --> 04:15:44,700
of it,

15601
04:15:44,700 --> 04:15:45,660
and as a punishment

15602
04:15:45,660 --> 04:15:46,100
for him,

15603
04:15:46,100 --> 04:15:47,040
as well as a possible

15604
04:15:47,040 --> 04:15:48,240
advantage to Jane.

15605
04:15:48,260 --> 04:15:49,440
She seriously hoped that

15606
04:15:49,440 --> 04:15:50,460
he might really soon

15607
04:15:50,460 --> 04:15:50,940
marry Mr.

15608
04:15:50,940 --> 04:15:52,060
D'Arcy sister.

15609
04:15:52,060 --> 04:15:53,280
As by Wickham's account,

15610
04:15:53,400 --> 04:15:54,080
she would make him

15611
04:15:54,080 --> 04:15:55,040
abundantly regret

15612
04:15:55,040 --> 04:15:56,120
what he had thrown away.

15613
04:15:57,240 --> 04:15:57,600
Mrs.

15614
04:15:57,600 --> 04:15:58,740
Gardiner about this time

15615
04:15:58,740 --> 04:15:59,600
reminded Elizabeth

15616
04:15:59,600 --> 04:16:00,300
of her promise

15617
04:16:00,300 --> 04:16:00,740
concerning

15618
04:16:00,740 --> 04:16:01,640
that gentleman

15619
04:16:01,640 --> 04:16:02,300
and required

15620
04:16:02,300 --> 04:16:03,140
information.

15621
04:16:03,140 --> 04:16:03,900
And Elizabeth

15622
04:16:03,900 --> 04:16:04,860
had such to send

15623
04:16:04,860 --> 04:16:05,520
as my father

15624
04:16:05,520 --> 04:16:06,200
gave contentment

15625
04:16:06,200 --> 04:16:06,900
to her aunt

15626
04:16:06,900 --> 04:16:08,100
and to herself.

15627
04:16:08,100 --> 04:16:09,540
His apparent partiality

15628
04:16:09,540 --> 04:16:10,680
had subsided.

15629
04:16:10,680 --> 04:16:11,460
His attentions

15630
04:16:11,460 --> 04:16:12,200
were over.

15631
04:16:12,200 --> 04:16:13,220
He was the admirer

15632
04:16:13,220 --> 04:16:14,420
of someone.

15633
04:16:14,420 --> 04:16:15,120
Elizabeth was

15634
04:16:15,120 --> 04:16:15,800
watchful enough

15635
04:16:15,800 --> 04:16:16,680
to see it all.

15636
04:16:16,680 --> 04:16:17,580
But she could see it

15637
04:16:17,580 --> 04:16:18,260
and write. Of it

15638
04:16:18,260 --> 04:16:19,580
without material pain.

15639
04:16:19,940 --> 04:16:20,880
Her heart had been

15640
04:16:20,880 --> 04:16:22,080
but slightly touched

15641
04:16:22,140 --> 04:16:22,920
and her vanity

15642
04:16:22,920 --> 04:16:23,600
was satisfied

15643
04:16:23,600 --> 04:16:24,140
with believing

15644
04:16:24,140 --> 04:16:25,020
that she would have been

15645
04:16:25,020 --> 04:16:26,060
his only choice

15646
04:16:26,060 --> 04:16:26,820
had fortune

15647
04:16:26,820 --> 04:16:27,960
permitted it.

15648
04:16:27,960 --> 04:16:28,460
The sudden

15649
04:16:28,460 --> 04:16:30,300
acquisition of ?10,000

15650
04:16:30,300 --> 04:16:30,780
was the most

15651
04:16:30,780 --> 04:16:31,620
remarkable charm

15652
04:16:31,620 --> 04:16:32,300
of the young lady

15653
04:16:32,300 --> 04:16:33,020
to whom he was now

15654
04:16:33,020 --> 04:16:33,780
rendering himself

15655
04:16:33,780 --> 04:16:34,740
agreeable.

15656
04:16:34,740 --> 04:16:35,660
But, Elizabeth,

15657
04:16:35,660 --> 04:16:36,300
less clear

15658
04:16:36,300 --> 04:16:37,100
sighted, perhaps

15659
04:16:37,100 --> 04:16:37,700
in this case

15660
04:16:37,700 --> 04:16:38,780
than in Charlotte's.

15661
04:16:38,780 --> 04:16:39,180
Did not.

15662
04:16:39,180 --> 04:16:39,900
Quarrel with him

15663
04:16:39,900 --> 04:16:40,500
for his wish of.

15664
04:16:40,500 --> 04:16:41,640
Independence?

15665
04:16:41,640 --> 04:16:42,200
Nothing.

15666
04:16:42,200 --> 04:16:43,160
On the contrary,

15667
04:16:43,160 --> 04:16:44,220
be more natural.

15668
04:16:44,220 --> 04:16:44,940
And while able

15669
04:16:44,940 --> 04:16:45,440
to suppose

15670
04:16:45,440 --> 04:16:46,080
that it cost him

15671
04:16:46,080 --> 04:16:46,740
a few struggles

15672
04:16:46,740 --> 04:16:47,820
to relinquish her,

15673
04:16:47,820 --> 04:16:48,380
she was ready

15674
04:16:48,380 --> 04:16:49,580
to allow it a wise

15675
04:16:49,580 --> 04:16:50,420
and desirable measure

15676
04:16:50,420 --> 04:16:51,080
for both

15677
04:16:51,080 --> 04:16:51,440
and could

15678
04:16:51,440 --> 04:16:52,680
very sincerely wish him.

15679
04:16:53,940 --> 04:16:54,620
All this was

15680
04:16:54,620 --> 04:16:55,520
acknowledged to Mrs.

15681
04:16:55,520 --> 04:16:56,160
Gardiner,

15682
04:16:56,160 --> 04:16:56,700
and after

15683
04:16:56,700 --> 04:16:57,240
relating the

15684
04:16:57,240 --> 04:16:58,220
circumstances

15685
04:16:58,220 --> 04:16:59,420
she thus went on.

15686
04:17:00,060 --> 04:17:00,600
I am now.

15687
04:17:00,600 --> 04:17:01,760
Convinced, my dear aunt.

15688
04:17:01,760 --> 04:17:02,300
That I have never

15689
04:17:02,300 --> 04:17:03,500
been much in love.

15690
04:17:03,560 --> 04:17:04,200
How I really.

15691
04:17:04,200 --> 04:17:05,720
Experience that pure

15692
04:17:05,720 --> 04:17:06,920
and elevating passion.

15693
04:17:07,080 --> 04:17:07,980
I should at present

15694
04:17:07,980 --> 04:17:09,240
detest his very name

15695
04:17:09,420 --> 04:17:10,320
and wish him all

15696
04:17:10,320 --> 04:17:11,520
manner of evil.

15697
04:17:11,720 --> 04:17:12,540
But my feelings

15698
04:17:12,540 --> 04:17:13,020
are not only

15699
04:17:13,020 --> 04:17:14,220
cordial towards him,

15700
04:17:14,400 --> 04:17:15,320
they are even impartial

15701
04:17:15,320 --> 04:17:16,520
towards this king.

15702
04:17:16,700 --> 04:17:17,340
I cannot.

15703
04:17:17,340 --> 04:17:18,080
Find out that I.

15704
04:17:18,080 --> 04:17:19,140
Hate her at all

15705
04:17:19,140 --> 04:17:20,160
or the time in the least

15706
04:17:20,160 --> 04:17:20,840
unwilling to think,

15707
04:17:20,840 --> 04:17:21,380
or a very good

15708
04:17:21,380 --> 04:17:22,520
sort of girl.

15709
04:17:22,520 --> 04:17:23,280
There can be no

15710
04:17:23,280 --> 04:17:24,480
love in all this.

15711
04:17:24,480 --> 04:17:25,380
My watchfulness

15712
04:17:25,380 --> 04:17:26,520
has been effectual.

15713
04:17:26,520 --> 04:17:27,020
And though I.

15714
04:17:27,020 --> 04:17:27,840
Certainly should be

15715
04:17:27,840 --> 04:17:28,040
a more

15716
04:17:28,040 --> 04:17:28,860
interesting object

15717
04:17:28,860 --> 04:17:30,020
to all my acquaintances,

15718
04:17:30,020 --> 04:17:31,220
would I distractedly in

15719
04:17:31,220 --> 04:17:32,100
love with him?

15720
04:17:32,100 --> 04:17:32,900
I cannot say that

15721
04:17:32,900 --> 04:17:33,300
I regret.

15722
04:17:33,300 --> 04:17:34,040
To my comparative.

15723
04:17:34,040 --> 04:17:35,220
Insignificance.

15724
04:17:35,220 --> 04:17:36,720
Importance may sometimes

15725
04:17:36,720 --> 04:17:38,120
be purchased too dearly.

15726
04:17:38,540 --> 04:17:39,600
Kitty and Lydia

15727
04:17:39,600 --> 04:17:40,500
take his defection

15728
04:17:40,500 --> 04:17:41,480
much more to heart than.

15729
04:17:41,480 --> 04:17:42,380
I do.

15730
04:17:42,380 --> 04:17:43,040
They are young

15731
04:17:43,040 --> 04:17:44,240
in the ways of the world

15732
04:17:44,240 --> 04:17:45,420
and yet opened

15733
04:17:45,420 --> 04:17:46,080
the mortifying

15734
04:17:46,080 --> 04:17:47,480
conviction that handsome

15735
04:17:47,480 --> 04:17:48,320
young men must.

15736
04:17:48,320 --> 04:17:49,200
Have something to live

15737
04:17:49,200 --> 04:17:50,880
on, as well as the plain

15738
04:17:52,200 --> 04:17:53,420
Chapter 27.

15739
04:17:54,800 --> 04:17:55,260
With no

15740
04:17:55,260 --> 04:17:55,940
greater events

15741
04:17:55,940 --> 04:17:56,460
than these

15742
04:17:56,460 --> 04:17:57,660
in the long born family

15743
04:17:57,780 --> 04:17:58,560
and otherwise

15744
04:17:58,560 --> 04:17:59,280
diversified

15745
04:17:59,280 --> 04:18:00,180
by little beyond

15746
04:18:00,180 --> 04:18:01,380
the walks to Maritain.

15747
04:18:01,440 --> 04:18:02,420
Sometimes dirty

15748
04:18:02,420 --> 04:18:03,620
and sometimes cold

15749
04:18:03,920 --> 04:18:04,820
to January

15750
04:18:04,820 --> 04:18:06,380
and February pass away.

15751
04:18:06,840 --> 04:18:07,620
March was to

15752
04:18:07,620 --> 04:18:08,400
take Elizabeth

15753
04:18:08,400 --> 04:18:09,600
to Hansford.

15754
04:18:09,660 --> 04:18:10,500
She had not

15755
04:18:10,500 --> 04:18:11,220
first thought

15756
04:18:11,220 --> 04:18:12,140
very seriously

15757
04:18:12,140 --> 04:18:13,340
of going thither,

15758
04:18:13,380 --> 04:18:14,120
but Charlotte,

15759
04:18:14,120 --> 04:18:15,080
she soon found,

15760
04:18:15,080 --> 04:18:15,840
was depending

15761
04:18:15,840 --> 04:18:16,620
on the plan

15762
04:18:16,620 --> 04:18:16,940
and she

15763
04:18:16,940 --> 04:18:17,720
gradually learned

15764
04:18:17,720 --> 04:18:18,840
to consider it herself

15765
04:18:18,840 --> 04:18:19,920
with greater pleasure

15766
04:18:19,920 --> 04:18:21,020
as well as greater

15767
04:18:21,020 --> 04:18:22,140
certainty.

15768
04:18:22,140 --> 04:18:23,300
Absence had increased

15769
04:18:23,300 --> 04:18:23,840
her desire

15770
04:18:23,840 --> 04:18:24,240
of seeing

15771
04:18:24,240 --> 04:18:25,160
Charlotte again

15772
04:18:25,160 --> 04:18:26,580
and weakened her disgust

15773
04:18:26,580 --> 04:18:26,900
of Mr.

15774
04:18:26,900 --> 04:18:27,920
Collins.

15775
04:18:27,920 --> 04:18:28,800
There was novelty

15776
04:18:28,800 --> 04:18:29,580
in the scheme.

15777
04:18:29,580 --> 04:18:31,160
And with such a mother

15778
04:18:31,160 --> 04:18:31,700
and such

15779
04:18:31,700 --> 04:18:32,900
companionable sisters.

15780
04:18:33,080 --> 04:18:33,960
Home could not be.

15781
04:18:33,960 --> 04:18:34,760
Faultless.

15782
04:18:34,760 --> 04:18:35,600
A little change

15783
04:18:35,600 --> 04:18:36,620
was not unwelcome

15784
04:18:36,620 --> 04:18:37,820
for its own sake.

15785
04:18:38,120 --> 04:18:38,660
The journey

15786
04:18:38,660 --> 04:18:39,260
would, moreover

15787
04:18:39,260 --> 04:18:40,560
give her a peep at Jane,

15788
04:18:40,800 --> 04:18:41,580
and in

15789
04:18:41,580 --> 04:18:42,780
as the time junior.

15790
04:18:42,860 --> 04:18:43,460
She would have been.

15791
04:18:43,460 --> 04:18:44,120
Very sorry

15792
04:18:44,120 --> 04:18:45,320
for any delay.

15793
04:18:45,500 --> 04:18:46,440
Everything, however,

15794
04:18:46,440 --> 04:18:46,680
went.

15795
04:18:46,680 --> 04:18:47,700
On smoothly

15796
04:18:47,700 --> 04:18:48,440
and was finally.

15797
04:18:48,440 --> 04:18:48,920
Settled,

15798
04:18:48,920 --> 04:18:49,820
according to Charlotte's

15799
04:18:49,820 --> 04:18:51,020
first. Sketch.

15800
04:18:51,140 --> 04:18:51,660
She was to.

15801
04:18:51,660 --> 04:18:52,280
Accompany Sir

15802
04:18:52,280 --> 04:18:52,920
William and his

15803
04:18:52,920 --> 04:18:54,120
second daughter.

15804
04:18:54,200 --> 04:18:54,920
The improvement

15805
04:18:54,920 --> 04:18:55,380
of spending

15806
04:18:55,380 --> 04:18:56,180
a night in London

15807
04:18:56,180 --> 04:18:57,380
was added in time,

15808
04:18:57,440 --> 04:18:58,460
and the plan became

15809
04:18:58,460 --> 04:18:59,060
as perfect

15810
04:18:59,060 --> 04:19:00,260
as plan could be.

15811
04:19:01,080 --> 04:19:01,940
The only pain

15812
04:19:01,940 --> 04:19:02,420
was in leaving

15813
04:19:02,420 --> 04:19:03,180
her father,

15814
04:19:03,180 --> 04:19:03,440
who would

15815
04:19:03,440 --> 04:19:04,560
certainly miss her,

15816
04:19:04,560 --> 04:19:05,120
and who,

15817
04:19:05,120 --> 04:19:05,600
when it came

15818
04:19:05,600 --> 04:19:06,320
to the point

15819
04:19:06,320 --> 04:19:06,840
so little

15820
04:19:06,840 --> 04:19:07,740
liked her going that

15821
04:19:07,740 --> 04:19:08,280
he told her to

15822
04:19:08,280 --> 04:19:09,800
write to him and almost

15823
04:19:10,320 --> 04:19:11,520
to answer her letter.

15824
04:19:12,300 --> 04:19:12,960
The farewell

15825
04:19:12,960 --> 04:19:13,980
between herself and Mr.

15826
04:19:13,980 --> 04:19:14,400
Wickham was

15827
04:19:14,400 --> 04:19:15,440
perfectly friendly

15828
04:19:15,440 --> 04:19:16,260
on his side.

15829
04:19:16,260 --> 04:19:17,820
Even more his presence

15830
04:19:17,820 --> 04:19:18,260
pursued

15831
04:19:18,260 --> 04:19:18,800
could not make

15832
04:19:18,800 --> 04:19:19,260
him forget

15833
04:19:19,260 --> 04:19:19,920
that Elizabeth

15834
04:19:19,920 --> 04:19:20,540
had been the first

15835
04:19:20,540 --> 04:19:21,180
to excite

15836
04:19:21,180 --> 04:19:21,380
and to

15837
04:19:21,380 --> 04:19:22,580
deserve his attention,

15838
04:19:22,640 --> 04:19:23,760
the first to listen

15839
04:19:23,760 --> 04:19:24,620
and to pity,

15840
04:19:24,620 --> 04:19:25,980
the first to be admired,

15841
04:19:26,240 --> 04:19:27,120
and in his manner

15842
04:19:27,120 --> 04:19:28,320
of bidding her adieu,

15843
04:19:28,340 --> 04:19:28,860
wishing her

15844
04:19:28,860 --> 04:19:29,880
every enjoyment

15845
04:19:29,880 --> 04:19:30,800
reminding her of what

15846
04:19:30,800 --> 04:19:31,760
she was to expect

15847
04:19:31,760 --> 04:19:32,120
in Lady

15848
04:19:32,120 --> 04:19:33,080
Catherine de Berg

15849
04:19:33,080 --> 04:19:33,720
and trusting

15850
04:19:33,720 --> 04:19:34,760
their opinion of her,

15851
04:19:34,760 --> 04:19:35,340
their opinion

15852
04:19:35,340 --> 04:19:36,060
of everybody

15853
04:19:36,060 --> 04:19:37,380
would always coincide.

15854
04:19:37,700 --> 04:19:38,180
There was a.

15855
04:19:38,180 --> 04:19:39,860
Solicitude, an interest.

15856
04:19:40,040 --> 04:19:40,700
Which she.

15857
04:19:40,700 --> 04:19:41,240
Felt must

15858
04:19:41,240 --> 04:19:42,500
ever attach her to him

15859
04:19:42,500 --> 04:19:42,980
with the most

15860
04:19:42,980 --> 04:19:44,180
sincere regard,

15861
04:19:44,400 --> 04:19:45,500
and she parted from him,

15862
04:19:45,500 --> 04:19:46,620
convinced that

15863
04:19:46,620 --> 04:19:47,400
whether married

15864
04:19:47,400 --> 04:19:48,300
or single,

15865
04:19:48,300 --> 04:19:49,440
he must always be her

15866
04:19:49,440 --> 04:19:50,720
model of the amiable

15867
04:19:50,720 --> 04:19:51,920
and pleasing

15868
04:19:52,140 --> 04:19:53,180
her fellow travelers.

15869
04:19:53,180 --> 04:19:54,060
The next day were

15870
04:19:54,060 --> 04:19:54,860
not of a kind

15871
04:19:54,860 --> 04:19:55,520
to make her thinking

15872
04:19:55,520 --> 04:19:56,720
less agreeable.

15873
04:19:56,720 --> 04:19:57,740
Sir William Lucas

15874
04:19:57,740 --> 04:19:58,940
and his daughter Maria,

15875
04:19:59,040 --> 04:20:00,180
a good humored

15876
04:20:00,180 --> 04:20:01,400
but as empty headed as

15877
04:20:01,400 --> 04:20:02,180
himself,

15878
04:20:02,180 --> 04:20:03,020
had nothing to say

15879
04:20:03,020 --> 04:20:03,380
that could be

15880
04:20:03,380 --> 04:20:04,220
worth hearing

15881
04:20:04,220 --> 04:20:05,220
and were listened to

15882
04:20:05,220 --> 04:20:05,600
with about

15883
04:20:05,600 --> 04:20:06,380
as much delight

15884
04:20:06,380 --> 04:20:06,900
as the rattle

15885
04:20:06,900 --> 04:20:07,940
of the shares.

15886
04:20:07,940 --> 04:20:08,540
Elizabeth

15887
04:20:08,540 --> 04:20:09,740
loved absurdities,

15888
04:20:09,780 --> 04:20:10,640
but she had known Sir

15889
04:20:10,640 --> 04:20:11,840
Williams too long.

15890
04:20:12,020 --> 04:20:12,600
He could tell her

15891
04:20:12,600 --> 04:20:13,160
nothing new

15892
04:20:13,160 --> 04:20:13,740
of the wonders

15893
04:20:13,740 --> 04:20:14,640
of his presentation

15894
04:20:14,640 --> 04:20:15,420
and knighthood,

15895
04:20:15,420 --> 04:20:16,320
and his abilities

15896
04:20:16,320 --> 04:20:17,160
were worn out

15897
04:20:17,160 --> 04:20:18,440
like his information.

15898
04:20:19,340 --> 04:20:20,040
It was a journey

15899
04:20:20,040 --> 04:20:21,420
of only 24 miles,

15900
04:20:21,420 --> 04:20:22,100
and they began it

15901
04:20:22,100 --> 04:20:22,700
so early

15902
04:20:22,700 --> 04:20:23,400
as to be in Grace

15903
04:20:23,400 --> 04:20:24,000
Church Street.

15904
04:20:24,000 --> 04:20:24,920
By noon

15905
04:20:24,920 --> 04:20:25,940
as they drove to Mr.

15906
04:20:25,940 --> 04:20:27,020
Gardner's door.

15907
04:20:27,020 --> 04:20:27,660
Jane was at

15908
04:20:27,660 --> 04:20:28,200
a drawing room

15909
04:20:28,200 --> 04:20:28,980
window watching.

15910
04:20:28,980 --> 04:20:29,940
Their arrival,

15911
04:20:29,940 --> 04:20:30,540
When they entered

15912
04:20:30,540 --> 04:20:31,100
the passage,

15913
04:20:31,100 --> 04:20:31,500
she was there

15914
04:20:31,500 --> 04:20:32,540
to welcome them.

15915
04:20:32,540 --> 04:20:33,560
And Elizabeth, looking

15916
04:20:33,560 --> 04:20:34,760
earnestly in her face,

15917
04:20:34,820 --> 04:20:35,820
was pleased to see it

15918
04:20:35,820 --> 04:20:36,920
healthful and lovely

15919
04:20:36,920 --> 04:20:37,920
as ever.

15920
04:20:37,920 --> 04:20:39,240
On the stairs were troop

15921
04:20:39,240 --> 04:20:40,500
of little boys and girls

15922
04:20:40,700 --> 04:20:41,420
whose eagerness

15923
04:20:41,420 --> 04:20:42,060
for their cousin's

15924
04:20:42,060 --> 04:20:42,540
appearance

15925
04:20:42,540 --> 04:20:43,280
would not allow them

15926
04:20:43,280 --> 04:20:43,620
to wait

15927
04:20:43,620 --> 04:20:44,640
in the drawing room,

15928
04:20:44,640 --> 04:20:45,620
and whose shyness,

15929
04:20:45,620 --> 04:20:45,980
as they had

15930
04:20:45,980 --> 04:20:46,640
not seen her for

15931
04:20:46,640 --> 04:20:47,940
12 month, prevented

15932
04:20:47,940 --> 04:20:49,140
their coming lower.

15933
04:20:49,260 --> 04:20:50,280
All was joy

15934
04:20:50,280 --> 04:20:51,480
and kindness.

15935
04:20:51,500 --> 04:20:52,620
The day passed most

15936
04:20:52,620 --> 04:20:53,720
pleasantly away

15937
04:20:53,720 --> 04:20:54,840
the morning and bustle

15938
04:20:54,840 --> 04:20:55,580
and shopping

15939
04:20:55,580 --> 04:20:56,300
and the evening

15940
04:20:56,300 --> 04:20:57,500
at one of the theaters.

15941
04:20:57,980 --> 04:20:58,700
Elizabeth then

15942
04:20:58,700 --> 04:20:59,240
contrived to

15943
04:20:59,240 --> 04:21:00,440
sit by her aunt.

15944
04:21:00,500 --> 04:21:01,520
Their first object

15945
04:21:01,520 --> 04:21:02,460
was her sister,

15946
04:21:02,460 --> 04:21:03,660
and she was more grieved

15947
04:21:03,660 --> 04:21:05,000
than astonished to hear

15948
04:21:05,000 --> 04:21:05,540
and reply

15949
04:21:05,540 --> 04:21:06,740
to her minute inquiries

15950
04:21:07,020 --> 04:21:07,820
that though Jane

15951
04:21:07,820 --> 04:21:08,580
always struggled

15952
04:21:08,580 --> 04:21:09,780
to support her spirits,

15953
04:21:09,920 --> 04:21:10,800
there were periods

15954
04:21:10,800 --> 04:21:12,000
of dejection.

15955
04:21:12,120 --> 04:21:13,040
It was reasonable,

15956
04:21:13,040 --> 04:21:13,760
however, to hope

15957
04:21:13,760 --> 04:21:14,120
that they would

15958
04:21:14,120 --> 04:21:15,320
not continue long.

15959
04:21:15,540 --> 04:21:15,860
Mrs.

15960
04:21:15,860 --> 04:21:16,680
Gardiner gave her

15961
04:21:16,680 --> 04:21:17,360
the particulars

15962
04:21:17,360 --> 04:21:18,560
also of Miss Bailey's

15963
04:21:18,560 --> 04:21:19,280
Visit in Grace

15964
04:21:19,280 --> 04:21:20,220
Church Street

15965
04:21:20,220 --> 04:21:20,840
and repeated

15966
04:21:20,840 --> 04:21:21,620
conversations

15967
04:21:21,620 --> 04:21:22,160
occurring at

15968
04:21:22,160 --> 04:21:23,040
different times

15969
04:21:23,040 --> 04:21:23,600
between Jane

15970
04:21:23,600 --> 04:21:24,440
and herself,

15971
04:21:24,440 --> 04:21:25,280
which proved that

15972
04:21:25,280 --> 04:21:25,880
the former

15973
04:21:25,880 --> 04:21:27,080
had from her heart

15974
04:21:27,200 --> 04:21:27,740
given up.

15975
04:21:27,740 --> 04:21:29,600
The acquaintance, Mrs.

15976
04:21:29,600 --> 04:21:30,080
Gardiner

15977
04:21:30,080 --> 04:21:30,720
then rallied her

15978
04:21:30,720 --> 04:21:31,520
niece on Wickham's

15979
04:21:31,520 --> 04:21:32,240
desertion

15980
04:21:32,240 --> 04:21:33,300
and complimented her on

15981
04:21:33,300 --> 04:21:34,340
bearing it so well.

15982
04:21:35,300 --> 04:21:36,720
But my dear Elizabeth,

15983
04:21:36,900 --> 04:21:37,940
she added,

15984
04:21:37,940 --> 04:21:39,240
What of a girl is Ms..

15985
04:21:39,240 --> 04:21:40,040
King?

15986
04:21:40,040 --> 04:21:40,880
I should be sorry

15987
04:21:40,880 --> 04:21:41,760
to think our friend

15988
04:21:41,760 --> 04:21:42,960
mercenary.

15989
04:21:43,240 --> 04:21:44,440
Pray, my dear aunt,

15990
04:21:44,480 --> 04:21:45,420
what is the difference.

15991
04:21:45,420 --> 04:21:46,680
In matrimonial affairs

15992
04:21:46,680 --> 04:21:46,980
between.

15993
04:21:46,980 --> 04:21:47,640
The mercenary

15994
04:21:47,640 --> 04:21:48,840
and the prudent motive?

15995
04:21:49,200 --> 04:21:50,420
Where does discretion.

15996
04:21:50,420 --> 04:21:52,100
End and avarice begin?

15997
04:21:52,520 --> 04:21:53,480
Last Christmas,

15998
04:21:53,480 --> 04:21:54,200
you were afraid of

15999
04:21:54,200 --> 04:21:54,980
his marrying me.

16000
04:21:54,980 --> 04:21:55,460
Because it would

16001
04:21:55,460 --> 04:21:56,520
be imprudent.

16002
04:21:56,520 --> 04:21:57,180
And now?

16003
04:21:57,180 --> 04:21:57,920
Because he is trying.

16004
04:21:57,920 --> 04:21:58,460
To get a girl

16005
04:21:58,460 --> 04:21:59,720
with only 10,000.

16006
04:21:59,720 --> 04:22:00,440
Pounds.

16007
04:22:00,440 --> 04:22:01,520
He want to find out that

16008
04:22:01,520 --> 04:22:02,720
he is mercenary.

16009
04:22:03,360 --> 04:22:04,640
If he will only tell me

16010
04:22:04,640 --> 04:22:05,460
what sort of girl

16011
04:22:05,460 --> 04:22:06,600
Miss King is.

16012
04:22:06,600 --> 04:22:07,380
I shall know

16013
04:22:07,380 --> 04:22:08,580
what to think.

16014
04:22:08,840 --> 04:22:09,600
She is a very good

16015
04:22:09,600 --> 04:22:10,800
sort of girl, I believe.

16016
04:22:10,940 --> 04:22:12,180
I know no harm of her.

16017
04:22:12,960 --> 04:22:13,760
But he paid her

16018
04:22:13,760 --> 04:22:14,040
not the

16019
04:22:14,040 --> 04:22:15,060
smallest attention.

16020
04:22:15,060 --> 04:22:16,040
Till her grandfather's.

16021
04:22:16,040 --> 04:22:17,180
Death made her mistress

16022
04:22:17,180 --> 04:22:18,380
this fortune.

16023
04:22:18,740 --> 04:22:19,560
No.

16024
04:22:19,560 --> 04:22:20,720
What should he

16025
04:22:20,720 --> 04:22:21,800
if it were not allowable

16026
04:22:21,800 --> 04:22:22,140
for him

16027
04:22:22,140 --> 04:22:23,300
to gain my affections

16028
04:22:23,300 --> 04:22:24,500
because I had no money?

16029
04:22:24,600 --> 04:22:25,340
What occasions

16030
04:22:25,340 --> 04:22:25,620
would there

16031
04:22:25,620 --> 04:22:26,160
be for him

16032
04:22:26,160 --> 04:22:27,180
making love to girl

16033
04:22:27,180 --> 04:22:27,480
whom he did

16034
04:22:27,480 --> 04:22:28,380
not care about and

16035
04:22:28,380 --> 04:22:29,360
who was equally pole?

16036
04:22:30,380 --> 04:22:30,700
But there

16037
04:22:30,700 --> 04:22:31,880
seems in a delicacy

16038
04:22:31,880 --> 04:22:32,420
in directing

16039
04:22:32,420 --> 04:22:33,060
his attentions

16040
04:22:33,060 --> 04:22:33,620
towards her

16041
04:22:33,620 --> 04:22:34,160
so soon

16042
04:22:34,160 --> 04:22:35,360
after this event,

16043
04:22:35,820 --> 04:22:36,380
and that in

16044
04:22:36,380 --> 04:22:37,580
distress

16045
04:22:37,860 --> 04:22:38,840
has not time

16046
04:22:38,840 --> 04:22:39,140
for all

16047
04:22:39,140 --> 04:22:40,340
those elegant decorum

16048
04:22:40,380 --> 04:22:40,760
which other

16049
04:22:40,760 --> 04:22:41,960
people may observe.

16050
04:22:42,140 --> 04:22:42,840
If she does not

16051
04:22:42,840 --> 04:22:43,400
object to it,

16052
04:22:43,400 --> 04:22:44,600
why should we?

16053
04:22:45,180 --> 04:22:45,740
Her not

16054
04:22:45,740 --> 04:22:47,540
objecting does not him.

16055
04:22:47,940 --> 04:22:49,220
It only shows her being.

16056
04:22:49,220 --> 04:22:49,700
Deficient

16057
04:22:49,700 --> 04:22:50,900
in something herself.

16058
04:22:51,000 --> 04:22:52,440
Sense or feeling.

16059
04:22:53,220 --> 04:22:54,300
Well, cried.

16060
04:22:54,300 --> 04:22:55,040
Elizabeth.

16061
04:22:55,040 --> 04:22:56,240
Have it as you choose.

16062
04:22:56,360 --> 04:22:57,680
He shall be mercenary

16063
04:22:57,680 --> 04:22:58,560
and she shall

16064
04:22:58,560 --> 04:22:59,660
be foolish.

16065
04:22:59,660 --> 04:23:00,480
No, Lizzie,

16066
04:23:00,480 --> 04:23:01,220
that is what I do

16067
04:23:01,220 --> 04:23:02,420
not choose.

16068
04:23:02,480 --> 04:23:03,360
I should be sorry,

16069
04:23:03,360 --> 04:23:04,040
you know, to think

16070
04:23:04,040 --> 04:23:04,920
ill of a young man

16071
04:23:04,920 --> 04:23:05,340
who has lived

16072
04:23:05,340 --> 04:23:06,540
so long in.

16073
04:23:07,460 --> 04:23:08,660
Oh, if that is all.

16074
04:23:08,780 --> 04:23:10,080
I have a very poor

16075
04:23:10,080 --> 04:23:10,940
opinion of young men

16076
04:23:10,940 --> 04:23:12,120
who live in Derbyshire

16077
04:23:12,120 --> 04:23:12,480
and their

16078
04:23:12,480 --> 04:23:13,400
intimate friends

16079
04:23:13,400 --> 04:23:13,620
who live

16080
04:23:13,620 --> 04:23:14,340
in Hertfordshire

16081
04:23:14,340 --> 04:23:15,540
are not much better.

16082
04:23:15,600 --> 04:23:17,240
I Am sick of them all.

16083
04:23:17,600 --> 04:23:18,360
Thank heaven.

16084
04:23:18,360 --> 04:23:19,160
I am going to morrow

16085
04:23:19,160 --> 04:23:20,060
where I shall find a man

16086
04:23:20,060 --> 04:23:20,960
who is not one

16087
04:23:20,960 --> 04:23:22,140
agreeable quality

16088
04:23:22,140 --> 04:23:23,180
who has neither manner

16089
04:23:23,180 --> 04:23:23,840
nor sent

16090
04:23:23,840 --> 04:23:25,040
to recommend him.

16091
04:23:25,140 --> 04:23:25,940
Stupid Men

16092
04:23:25,940 --> 04:23:26,700
are the only ones

16093
04:23:26,700 --> 04:23:28,040
worth knowing after all.

16094
04:23:28,860 --> 04:23:30,060
Take care, Lizzie.

16095
04:23:30,240 --> 04:23:31,440
That speech save a

16096
04:23:31,440 --> 04:23:32,280
strongly of

16097
04:23:32,280 --> 04:23:33,180
disappointment.

16098
04:23:34,320 --> 04:23:34,920
Before they were

16099
04:23:34,920 --> 04:23:35,580
separated by

16100
04:23:35,580 --> 04:23:36,180
the conclusion

16101
04:23:36,180 --> 04:23:36,980
of the play.

16102
04:23:36,980 --> 04:23:38,060
She had the unexpected

16103
04:23:38,060 --> 04:23:38,600
happiness

16104
04:23:38,600 --> 04:23:39,360
of an invitation

16105
04:23:39,360 --> 04:23:40,380
to accompany her uncle

16106
04:23:40,380 --> 04:23:41,040
and aunt in a

16107
04:23:41,040 --> 04:23:42,060
tour of pleasure,

16108
04:23:42,060 --> 04:23:42,920
which they proposed

16109
04:23:42,920 --> 04:23:44,120
taking in the summer.

16110
04:23:44,660 --> 04:23:45,660
We have noted a term

16111
04:23:45,660 --> 04:23:46,160
and how far it

16112
04:23:46,160 --> 04:23:46,700
shall carry.

16113
04:23:46,700 --> 04:23:47,760
Us, said Mrs.

16114
04:23:47,760 --> 04:23:48,560
Gardner.

16115
04:23:48,560 --> 04:23:49,500
But perhaps

16116
04:23:49,500 --> 04:23:50,700
to the lakes.

16117
04:23:50,960 --> 04:23:51,740
No scheme

16118
04:23:51,740 --> 04:23:52,100
could have been

16119
04:23:52,100 --> 04:23:52,760
more agreeable

16120
04:23:52,760 --> 04:23:54,000
to Elizabeth and her

16121
04:23:54,000 --> 04:23:54,540
acceptance

16122
04:23:54,540 --> 04:23:55,520
of the invitation.

16123
04:23:55,520 --> 04:23:56,940
Most ready and grateful.

16124
04:23:57,540 --> 04:23:59,300
Oh, my dear, dear aunt.

16125
04:23:59,400 --> 04:24:00,660
She rapturously cried.

16126
04:24:00,900 --> 04:24:02,100
What delight

16127
04:24:02,120 --> 04:24:03,320
was Felicity?

16128
04:24:03,480 --> 04:24:04,400
You give me fresh

16129
04:24:04,400 --> 04:24:05,600
life and vigor

16130
04:24:05,720 --> 04:24:06,260
adieu due

16131
04:24:06,260 --> 04:24:07,080
to disappointment

16132
04:24:07,080 --> 04:24:08,100
and spleen.

16133
04:24:08,100 --> 04:24:09,140
What are young men to

16134
04:24:09,140 --> 04:24:10,680
rocks and mountains.

16135
04:24:11,080 --> 04:24:12,020
Oh, what's ours

16136
04:24:12,020 --> 04:24:12,800
of transport

16137
04:24:12,800 --> 04:24:13,920
We shall spend.

16138
04:24:13,920 --> 04:24:15,080
And when we do return,

16139
04:24:15,080 --> 04:24:15,560
it shall not

16140
04:24:15,560 --> 04:24:16,140
be like other.

16141
04:24:16,140 --> 04:24:17,160
Travelers without being.

16142
04:24:17,160 --> 04:24:17,640
Able to give

16143
04:24:17,640 --> 04:24:18,320
one accurate

16144
04:24:18,320 --> 04:24:19,520
idea of anything.

16145
04:24:19,640 --> 04:24:20,660
We will know

16146
04:24:20,660 --> 04:24:21,500
where we have gone.

16147
04:24:21,500 --> 04:24:22,580
We will recollect

16148
04:24:22,580 --> 04:24:23,600
what we have seen.

16149
04:24:23,600 --> 04:24:24,800
Lakes, mountains,

16150
04:24:24,860 --> 04:24:25,700
rivers shall not

16151
04:24:25,700 --> 04:24:26,220
be jumbled.

16152
04:24:26,220 --> 04:24:26,700
Together in.

16153
04:24:26,700 --> 04:24:27,900
Our imaginations,

16154
04:24:27,900 --> 04:24:28,740
nor when we.

16155
04:24:28,740 --> 04:24:29,700
Attempt to describe

16156
04:24:29,700 --> 04:24:30,720
any particular scene

16157
04:24:30,720 --> 04:24:31,320
when we begin

16158
04:24:31,320 --> 04:24:31,820
quarreling

16159
04:24:31,820 --> 04:24:32,600
about its relative.

16160
04:24:32,600 --> 04:24:33,800
Situation.

16161
04:24:33,800 --> 04:24:35,480
Let our effusions

16162
04:24:35,480 --> 04:24:36,800
be less insupportable.

16163
04:24:36,800 --> 04:24:37,500
Than those of the

16164
04:24:37,500 --> 04:24:39,000
generality of travelers.

16165
04:24:40,680 --> 04:24:41,520
Chapter 20.

16166
04:24:41,520 --> 04:24:42,720
Eight.

16167
04:24:43,020 --> 04:24:43,440
Every

16168
04:24:43,440 --> 04:24:44,640
object in the next

16169
04:24:44,760 --> 04:24:45,560
journey was new

16170
04:24:45,560 --> 04:24:46,260
and interesting

16171
04:24:46,260 --> 04:24:47,180
to Elizabeth,

16172
04:24:47,180 --> 04:24:48,140
and her spirits were

16173
04:24:48,140 --> 04:24:49,340
in a state of enjoyment,

16174
04:24:49,620 --> 04:24:50,480
for she had seen her

16175
04:24:50,480 --> 04:24:51,720
sister looking so well

16176
04:24:51,720 --> 04:24:52,320
as to banish

16177
04:24:52,320 --> 04:24:53,540
all fear for her health

16178
04:24:53,760 --> 04:24:54,740
and the prospect of her

16179
04:24:54,740 --> 04:24:55,460
northern tour

16180
04:24:55,460 --> 04:24:56,220
was a constant

16181
04:24:56,220 --> 04:24:57,420
source of delight.

16182
04:24:57,840 --> 04:24:58,460
When they left

16183
04:24:58,460 --> 04:24:59,040
the high road

16184
04:24:59,040 --> 04:24:59,460
for the lane

16185
04:24:59,460 --> 04:25:00,780
to Hansford, every

16186
04:25:00,780 --> 04:25:01,320
I was in

16187
04:25:01,320 --> 04:25:02,520
search of the parsonage

16188
04:25:02,580 --> 04:25:03,540
and every turning

16189
04:25:03,540 --> 04:25:04,080
expected

16190
04:25:04,080 --> 04:25:05,280
to bring it in view.

16191
04:25:05,420 --> 04:25:06,080
The railings

16192
04:25:06,080 --> 04:25:06,680
of rose Ings

16193
04:25:06,680 --> 04:25:07,220
Park was

16194
04:25:07,220 --> 04:25:07,760
their boundary

16195
04:25:07,760 --> 04:25:08,900
on one side.

16196
04:25:08,900 --> 04:25:09,920
Elizabeth smiled

16197
04:25:09,920 --> 04:25:10,700
at the recollection

16198
04:25:10,700 --> 04:25:11,180
of all that

16199
04:25:11,180 --> 04:25:11,760
she had heard

16200
04:25:11,760 --> 04:25:12,960
of its inhabitants.

16201
04:25:13,400 --> 04:25:13,980
At length,

16202
04:25:13,980 --> 04:25:14,660
the parsonage

16203
04:25:14,660 --> 04:25:15,780
was discernible,

16204
04:25:15,780 --> 04:25:16,340
the garden

16205
04:25:16,340 --> 04:25:17,480
sloping to the road.

16206
04:25:17,480 --> 04:25:18,060
The house

16207
04:25:18,060 --> 04:25:18,980
standing in it,

16208
04:25:18,980 --> 04:25:19,940
the green pails

16209
04:25:19,940 --> 04:25:21,120
and the laurel hedge.

16210
04:25:21,120 --> 04:25:22,240
Everything declared

16211
04:25:22,240 --> 04:25:23,440
they were arriving.

16212
04:25:23,640 --> 04:25:23,960
Mr.

16213
04:25:23,960 --> 04:25:25,040
Collins and Charlotte

16214
04:25:25,040 --> 04:25:26,120
appeared at the door

16215
04:25:26,120 --> 04:25:27,180
and the carriage stopped

16216
04:25:27,180 --> 04:25:27,980
at the small gate,

16217
04:25:27,980 --> 04:25:28,980
which led by a short

16218
04:25:28,980 --> 04:25:29,300
gravel

16219
04:25:29,300 --> 04:25:30,420
walk to the house.

16220
04:25:30,420 --> 04:25:31,380
Amidst the nods

16221
04:25:31,380 --> 04:25:32,040
and smiles

16222
04:25:32,040 --> 04:25:33,240
of the whole party.

16223
04:25:33,480 --> 04:25:34,100
In a moment

16224
04:25:34,100 --> 04:25:34,640
they were

16225
04:25:34,640 --> 04:25:35,580
out of the shares,

16226
04:25:35,580 --> 04:25:36,180
rejoicing

16227
04:25:36,180 --> 04:25:36,320
at the

16228
04:25:36,320 --> 04:25:37,520
sight of each other.

16229
04:25:37,560 --> 04:25:37,940
Mrs.

16230
04:25:37,940 --> 04:25:38,400
Collins

16231
04:25:38,400 --> 04:25:39,180
welcomed her friend

16232
04:25:39,180 --> 04:25:39,960
for the liveliest

16233
04:25:39,960 --> 04:25:41,280
pleasure, and Elizabeth

16234
04:25:41,280 --> 04:25:41,700
was more

16235
04:25:41,700 --> 04:25:42,600
and more satisfied

16236
04:25:42,600 --> 04:25:43,100
with coming

16237
04:25:43,100 --> 04:25:43,920
when she found herself

16238
04:25:43,920 --> 04:25:44,780
so affectionately

16239
04:25:44,780 --> 04:25:45,800
received.

16240
04:25:45,800 --> 04:25:46,800
She saw instantly

16241
04:25:46,800 --> 04:25:47,000
that her

16242
04:25:47,000 --> 04:25:47,820
cousin's manners

16243
04:25:47,820 --> 04:25:48,600
were not altered

16244
04:25:48,600 --> 04:25:49,620
by his marriage.

16245
04:25:49,620 --> 04:25:50,960
His formal civility

16246
04:25:50,960 --> 04:25:51,980
was just what it had.

16247
04:25:51,980 --> 04:25:53,240
Been, and he detained.

16248
04:25:53,240 --> 04:25:54,000
Her some

16249
04:25:54,000 --> 04:25:54,900
at the gate to hear

16250
04:25:54,900 --> 04:25:55,580
and satisfy

16251
04:25:55,580 --> 04:25:56,340
his inquiries.

16252
04:25:56,340 --> 04:25:57,540
After all, her family,

16253
04:25:58,020 --> 04:25:58,760
they were then

16254
04:25:58,760 --> 04:25:59,660
with no other delay

16255
04:25:59,660 --> 04:26:00,440
than his pointing out

16256
04:26:00,440 --> 04:26:00,860
the neatness

16257
04:26:00,860 --> 04:26:01,800
of the entrance

16258
04:26:01,800 --> 04:26:03,000
taken into the house.

16259
04:26:03,020 --> 04:26:03,680
And as soon

16260
04:26:03,680 --> 04:26:04,800
they were in the parlor,

16261
04:26:04,800 --> 04:26:05,640
he welcomed them

16262
04:26:05,640 --> 04:26:06,560
a second time

16263
04:26:06,560 --> 04:26:07,580
with ostentatious

16264
04:26:07,580 --> 04:26:08,220
formality

16265
04:26:08,220 --> 04:26:09,500
to his humble abode

16266
04:26:09,720 --> 04:26:10,940
and punctually repeated

16267
04:26:10,940 --> 04:26:11,660
all his wife's

16268
04:26:11,660 --> 04:26:12,860
offers of refreshment.

16269
04:26:13,580 --> 04:26:14,760
Elizabeth was prepared

16270
04:26:14,760 --> 04:26:15,960
to see him in his glory,

16271
04:26:16,020 --> 04:26:16,880
and she could not help

16272
04:26:16,880 --> 04:26:17,480
in fancying

16273
04:26:17,480 --> 04:26:18,200
that in displaying

16274
04:26:18,200 --> 04:26:18,960
the good proportion

16275
04:26:18,960 --> 04:26:19,680
of the room,

16276
04:26:19,680 --> 04:26:20,540
its aspect

16277
04:26:20,540 --> 04:26:21,720
and its furniture.

16278
04:26:21,720 --> 04:26:22,640
He addressed himself,

16279
04:26:22,640 --> 04:26:23,900
particularly to her

16280
04:26:24,120 --> 04:26:24,900
as if wishing

16281
04:26:24,900 --> 04:26:25,620
to make her feel

16282
04:26:25,620 --> 04:26:26,580
what she had lost

16283
04:26:26,580 --> 04:26:27,780
and refusing him.

16284
04:26:27,960 --> 04:26:28,580
But though

16285
04:26:28,580 --> 04:26:29,340
everything seemed

16286
04:26:29,340 --> 04:26:30,540
neat and comfortable,

16287
04:26:30,600 --> 04:26:31,500
she was not able to

16288
04:26:31,500 --> 04:26:32,180
gratify him

16289
04:26:32,180 --> 04:26:33,080
by any sign of

16290
04:26:34,080 --> 04:26:34,520
and rather

16291
04:26:34,520 --> 04:26:35,300
looked with wonder

16292
04:26:35,300 --> 04:26:35,840
at her friend

16293
04:26:35,840 --> 04:26:36,420
that she could have

16294
04:26:36,420 --> 04:26:37,460
so cheerful an heir

16295
04:26:37,460 --> 04:26:38,660
with such a companion.

16296
04:26:39,000 --> 04:26:39,440
When Mr.

16297
04:26:39,440 --> 04:26:40,260
Collins said

16298
04:26:40,260 --> 04:26:40,940
anything of which

16299
04:26:40,940 --> 04:26:41,340
his wife

16300
04:26:41,340 --> 04:26:42,020
might reasonably

16301
04:26:42,020 --> 04:26:42,900
be ashamed,

16302
04:26:42,900 --> 04:26:43,680
which certainly.

16303
04:26:43,680 --> 04:26:44,880
Was not on seldom.

16304
04:26:45,000 --> 04:26:45,980
She involuntarily

16305
04:26:45,980 --> 04:26:46,520
turned her eye

16306
04:26:46,520 --> 04:26:47,600
on Charlotte

16307
04:26:47,600 --> 04:26:48,480
once or twice

16308
04:26:48,480 --> 04:26:49,020
she could discern

16309
04:26:49,020 --> 04:26:50,000
a faint blush.

16310
04:26:50,000 --> 04:26:50,820
But in general,

16311
04:26:50,820 --> 04:26:51,900
Charlotte wisely

16312
04:26:51,900 --> 04:26:53,100
did not hear

16313
04:26:53,280 --> 04:26:53,960
after sitting

16314
04:26:53,960 --> 04:26:54,860
long enough to admire

16315
04:26:54,860 --> 04:26:55,520
every article

16316
04:26:55,520 --> 04:26:56,040
of furniture

16317
04:26:56,040 --> 04:26:56,700
in the room,

16318
04:26:56,700 --> 04:26:57,620
from the sideboard

16319
04:26:57,620 --> 04:26:58,520
to the fender.

16320
04:26:58,520 --> 04:26:59,240
To give an account

16321
04:26:59,240 --> 04:26:59,880
of their journey

16322
04:26:59,880 --> 04:27:00,380
and of all that

16323
04:27:00,380 --> 04:27:01,580
had happened in London.

16324
04:27:01,760 --> 04:27:02,520
Mr.

16325
04:27:02,520 --> 04:27:03,120
invited them

16326
04:27:03,120 --> 04:27:03,720
to take a stroll

16327
04:27:03,720 --> 04:27:04,500
in the garden.

16328
04:27:04,500 --> 04:27:04,740
Which.

16329
04:27:04,740 --> 04:27:05,300
Was large

16330
04:27:05,300 --> 04:27:06,380
and well laid out,

16331
04:27:06,380 --> 04:27:07,580
and to the cultivation

16332
04:27:07,580 --> 04:27:08,100
of which

16333
04:27:08,100 --> 04:27:09,300
he attended himself.

16334
04:27:09,540 --> 04:27:10,620
To work in this garden

16335
04:27:10,620 --> 04:27:11,100
was one of his

16336
04:27:11,100 --> 04:27:12,300
most respectable,

16337
04:27:12,780 --> 04:27:13,460
and Elizabeth

16338
04:27:13,460 --> 04:27:13,880
admired

16339
04:27:13,880 --> 04:27:14,360
the command

16340
04:27:14,360 --> 04:27:15,060
of countenance

16341
04:27:15,060 --> 04:27:15,980
with which Charlotte

16342
04:27:15,980 --> 04:27:16,320
talked

16343
04:27:16,320 --> 04:27:17,040
of the healthfulness

16344
04:27:17,040 --> 04:27:18,240
of the exercise,

16345
04:27:18,240 --> 04:27:19,700
and she encouraged it

16346
04:27:19,700 --> 04:27:21,000
as much as possible.

16347
04:27:21,540 --> 04:27:22,680
Here, leading the way

16348
04:27:22,680 --> 04:27:23,480
through every walk

16349
04:27:23,480 --> 04:27:24,480
and crosswalk

16350
04:27:24,480 --> 04:27:25,160
and scarcely

16351
04:27:25,160 --> 04:27:25,700
allowing them

16352
04:27:25,700 --> 04:27:26,160
an integral

16353
04:27:26,160 --> 04:27:26,900
to utter the praise

16354
04:27:26,900 --> 04:27:28,040
as he asked for.

16355
04:27:28,040 --> 04:27:28,640
Every view

16356
04:27:28,640 --> 04:27:29,400
was pointed out

16357
04:27:29,400 --> 04:27:30,240
with a mind newness,

16358
04:27:30,240 --> 04:27:31,020
which left beauty

16359
04:27:31,020 --> 04:27:32,220
entirely behind.

16360
04:27:32,600 --> 04:27:33,200
He could number

16361
04:27:33,200 --> 04:27:33,720
the fields

16362
04:27:33,720 --> 04:27:34,740
in every direction

16363
04:27:34,740 --> 04:27:35,360
and could tell

16364
04:27:35,360 --> 04:27:36,140
how many trees

16365
04:27:36,140 --> 04:27:36,480
there were

16366
04:27:36,480 --> 04:27:36,980
in the most

16367
04:27:36,980 --> 04:27:38,180
distant clump.

16368
04:27:38,420 --> 04:27:39,540
But of all the views

16369
04:27:39,540 --> 04:27:40,260
which his garden

16370
04:27:40,260 --> 04:27:40,620
or which

16371
04:27:40,620 --> 04:27:41,580
the country or kingdom

16372
04:27:41,580 --> 04:27:42,480
could boast.

16373
04:27:42,480 --> 04:27:43,100
None were to be.

16374
04:27:43,100 --> 04:27:43,580
Compared

16375
04:27:43,580 --> 04:27:44,400
with the prospect

16376
04:27:44,400 --> 04:27:46,040
of rose eggs afforded

16377
04:27:46,040 --> 04:27:46,740
by an opening

16378
04:27:46,740 --> 04:27:47,340
in the trees

16379
04:27:47,340 --> 04:27:47,880
that bordered

16380
04:27:47,880 --> 04:27:48,540
the park near

16381
04:27:48,540 --> 04:27:49,100
the opposite

16382
04:27:49,100 --> 04:27:49,620
the front of his.

16383
04:27:49,620 --> 04:27:50,460
House.

16384
04:27:50,460 --> 04:27:50,880
It was a.

16385
04:27:50,880 --> 04:27:51,380
Handsome,

16386
04:27:51,380 --> 04:27:52,400
modern building,

16387
04:27:52,400 --> 04:27:53,700
well situated on

16388
04:27:53,700 --> 04:27:54,900
rising ground.

16389
04:27:55,580 --> 04:27:56,640
From his garden, Mr.

16390
04:27:56,640 --> 04:27:57,440
Collins would have led

16391
04:27:57,440 --> 04:27:58,040
them round his

16392
04:27:58,040 --> 04:27:59,000
to Meadows.

16393
04:27:59,000 --> 04:27:59,900
But the lady's

16394
04:27:59,900 --> 04:28:00,860
not having shoes

16395
04:28:00,860 --> 04:28:01,380
to encounter

16396
04:28:01,380 --> 04:28:02,220
the remains of a white

16397
04:28:02,220 --> 04:28:03,500
frost turned back.

16398
04:28:03,840 --> 04:28:04,920
And while Sir William

16399
04:28:04,920 --> 04:28:05,780
accompanied him,

16400
04:28:05,780 --> 04:28:06,380
Charlotte

16401
04:28:06,380 --> 04:28:07,040
took her sister

16402
04:28:07,040 --> 04:28:07,620
and friend

16403
04:28:07,620 --> 04:28:08,520
over the house.

16404
04:28:08,520 --> 04:28:09,860
Extremely well pleased.

16405
04:28:09,860 --> 04:28:10,560
Probably to have

16406
04:28:10,560 --> 04:28:11,300
the opportunity

16407
04:28:11,300 --> 04:28:11,880
of showing it

16408
04:28:11,880 --> 04:28:12,360
without her

16409
04:28:12,360 --> 04:28:13,560
husband's help.

16410
04:28:13,580 --> 04:28:14,780
It was rather small,

16411
04:28:14,840 --> 04:28:15,720
but well-built

16412
04:28:15,720 --> 04:28:16,700
and convenient,

16413
04:28:16,700 --> 04:28:17,400
and everything

16414
04:28:17,400 --> 04:28:18,080
was fitted up

16415
04:28:18,080 --> 04:28:18,560
and arranged

16416
04:28:18,560 --> 04:28:19,200
with a neatness

16417
04:28:19,200 --> 04:28:20,460
and consistency, of

16418
04:28:20,460 --> 04:28:21,180
which Elizabeth

16419
04:28:21,180 --> 04:28:21,920
gave Charlotte

16420
04:28:21,920 --> 04:28:23,120
all the credit.

16421
04:28:23,280 --> 04:28:23,760
When Mr.

16422
04:28:23,760 --> 04:28:24,300
Collins could

16423
04:28:24,300 --> 04:28:25,160
be forgotten,

16424
04:28:25,160 --> 04:28:26,180
there was really an air

16425
04:28:26,180 --> 04:28:27,120
of great comfort

16426
04:28:27,120 --> 04:28:27,840
throughout

16427
04:28:27,840 --> 04:28:28,800
and by Charlotte's

16428
04:28:28,800 --> 04:28:30,000
evident enjoyment of.

16429
04:28:30,240 --> 04:28:31,200
Elizabeth supposed

16430
04:28:31,200 --> 04:28:31,740
he must be

16431
04:28:31,740 --> 04:28:32,940
often forgotten.

16432
04:28:33,680 --> 04:28:34,640
She had already learned

16433
04:28:34,640 --> 04:28:35,460
that Lady Catherine

16434
04:28:35,460 --> 04:28:35,880
was still in

16435
04:28:35,880 --> 04:28:36,680
the country.

16436
04:28:36,680 --> 04:28:37,740
It was spoken of again

16437
04:28:37,740 --> 04:28:38,040
while they

16438
04:28:38,040 --> 04:28:38,840
were at dinner.

16439
04:28:38,840 --> 04:28:39,300
When Mr.

16440
04:28:39,300 --> 04:28:39,860
Collins

16441
04:28:39,860 --> 04:28:41,100
joining in observed.

16442
04:28:41,600 --> 04:28:42,980
Yes, Miss Elizabeth,

16443
04:28:43,080 --> 04:28:44,060
you will have the honor

16444
04:28:44,060 --> 04:28:45,180
of seeing Lady Catherine

16445
04:28:45,180 --> 04:28:46,460
de Boer on the ensuing

16446
04:28:46,460 --> 04:28:47,660
Sunday at church,

16447
04:28:48,000 --> 04:28:49,040
and I need not say

16448
04:28:49,040 --> 04:28:49,400
you will be

16449
04:28:49,400 --> 04:28:50,240
delighted with her.

16450
04:28:51,300 --> 04:28:51,780
She is all

16451
04:28:51,780 --> 04:28:52,680
affability and

16452
04:28:52,680 --> 04:28:53,880
condescension,

16453
04:28:54,120 --> 04:28:55,400
and I doubt not.

16454
04:28:55,400 --> 04:28:55,880
But you will

16455
04:28:55,880 --> 04:28:56,420
be honored

16456
04:28:56,420 --> 04:28:57,260
with some portion

16457
04:28:57,260 --> 04:28:57,960
of her notice

16458
04:28:57,960 --> 04:28:59,160
when service is over.

16459
04:28:59,400 --> 04:29:00,180
I scarcely

16460
04:29:00,180 --> 04:29:01,500
any hesitation in saying

16461
04:29:01,500 --> 04:29:02,340
that she will include

16462
04:29:02,340 --> 04:29:03,800
you and my sister Maria

16463
04:29:04,520 --> 04:29:05,720
in every invitation

16464
04:29:05,720 --> 04:29:06,600
with which she honors

16465
04:29:06,600 --> 04:29:07,080
us during

16466
04:29:07,080 --> 04:29:08,040
your stay here.

16467
04:29:08,040 --> 04:29:08,720
Her behavior.

16468
04:29:08,720 --> 04:29:09,320
To my dear

16469
04:29:09,320 --> 04:29:10,520
Charlotte, is charming.

16470
04:29:11,120 --> 04:29:12,180
We dine at Rose's

16471
04:29:12,180 --> 04:29:13,380
twice every week

16472
04:29:13,980 --> 04:29:14,780
and are never allowed

16473
04:29:14,780 --> 04:29:15,980
to walk home.

16474
04:29:16,520 --> 04:29:17,220
Her lady ships

16475
04:29:17,220 --> 04:29:18,420
carriage is regularly

16476
04:29:18,420 --> 04:29:19,620
ordered for us.

16477
04:29:20,220 --> 04:29:21,440
I should say one of her

16478
04:29:21,440 --> 04:29:22,640
ladies ships carriages.

16479
04:29:23,280 --> 04:29:23,660
So she has

16480
04:29:23,660 --> 04:29:24,860
several.

16481
04:29:25,800 --> 04:29:26,660
Lady Catherine is

16482
04:29:26,660 --> 04:29:27,500
a very respectable,

16483
04:29:27,500 --> 04:29:28,760
sensible woman indeed,

16484
04:29:28,980 --> 04:29:30,180
added Charlotte.

16485
04:29:30,180 --> 04:29:30,740
And a most

16486
04:29:30,740 --> 04:29:31,940
attentive neighbor.

16487
04:29:32,720 --> 04:29:33,920
Very true, my dear.

16488
04:29:34,340 --> 04:29:35,220
That is exactly

16489
04:29:35,220 --> 04:29:36,420
what I say.

16490
04:29:37,680 --> 04:29:38,720
She is the sort of woman

16491
04:29:38,720 --> 04:29:39,080
whom one

16492
04:29:39,080 --> 04:29:39,900
cannot regard with

16493
04:29:39,900 --> 04:29:40,820
too much difference.

16494
04:29:42,240 --> 04:29:43,220
The evening was spent.

16495
04:29:43,220 --> 04:29:44,460
Chiefly in talking over

16496
04:29:44,460 --> 04:29:45,620
Hertfordshire News

16497
04:29:45,620 --> 04:29:46,520
and telling again

16498
04:29:46,520 --> 04:29:47,160
what had already

16499
04:29:47,160 --> 04:29:48,000
been written

16500
04:29:48,000 --> 04:29:49,160
and when it closed.

16501
04:29:49,160 --> 04:29:49,820
Elizabeth,

16502
04:29:49,820 --> 04:29:50,580
in the solitude

16503
04:29:50,580 --> 04:29:51,440
of her chamber,

16504
04:29:51,440 --> 04:29:52,340
had to meditate

16505
04:29:52,340 --> 04:29:53,060
upon Charlotte's

16506
04:29:53,060 --> 04:29:54,260
degree of contentment

16507
04:29:54,360 --> 04:29:55,160
to understand

16508
04:29:55,160 --> 04:29:55,760
her address

16509
04:29:55,760 --> 04:29:56,460
and guiding

16510
04:29:56,460 --> 04:29:57,180
and composure

16511
04:29:57,180 --> 04:29:57,740
in bearing

16512
04:29:57,740 --> 04:29:58,680
with her husband,

16513
04:29:58,680 --> 04:29:59,660
and to acknowledge

16514
04:29:59,660 --> 04:30:00,680
that it was all done

16515
04:30:00,680 --> 04:30:01,860
very well.

16516
04:30:01,860 --> 04:30:02,600
She had also

16517
04:30:02,600 --> 04:30:03,320
to anticipate

16518
04:30:03,320 --> 04:30:03,900
how her visit

16519
04:30:03,900 --> 04:30:04,700
would pass.

16520
04:30:04,700 --> 04:30:05,760
The quiet tenor

16521
04:30:05,760 --> 04:30:06,060
of their

16522
04:30:06,060 --> 04:30:07,260
usual employments.

16523
04:30:07,320 --> 04:30:08,180
The vexatious

16524
04:30:08,180 --> 04:30:09,180
interruptions of Mr.

16525
04:30:09,180 --> 04:30:09,840
Collins

16526
04:30:09,840 --> 04:30:10,680
and the gay ities

16527
04:30:10,680 --> 04:30:11,400
of their intercourse

16528
04:30:11,400 --> 04:30:12,480
with rose ings.

16529
04:30:12,480 --> 04:30:13,100
A lively.

16530
04:30:13,100 --> 04:30:14,340
Imagination soon.

16531
04:30:14,340 --> 04:30:15,540
Settled at all

16532
04:30:15,800 --> 04:30:16,440
about the middle

16533
04:30:16,440 --> 04:30:17,320
of the next day.

16534
04:30:17,320 --> 04:30:18,060
She was in her room,

16535
04:30:18,060 --> 04:30:18,480
getting ready

16536
04:30:18,480 --> 04:30:19,380
for a walk.

16537
04:30:19,380 --> 04:30:19,800
A sudden.

16538
04:30:19,800 --> 04:30:20,540
Noise below

16539
04:30:20,540 --> 04:30:21,140
seemed to speak

16540
04:30:21,140 --> 04:30:21,900
the whole house.

16541
04:30:21,900 --> 04:30:22,880
In confusion.

16542
04:30:22,880 --> 04:30:23,360
And after

16543
04:30:23,360 --> 04:30:24,140
listening a moment,

16544
04:30:24,140 --> 04:30:24,840
she heard somebody

16545
04:30:24,840 --> 04:30:25,640
running up the stairs

16546
04:30:25,640 --> 04:30:26,820
in a violent hurry

16547
04:30:26,820 --> 04:30:28,380
and calling loudly her.

16548
04:30:28,740 --> 04:30:29,660
She opened the door

16549
04:30:29,660 --> 04:30:30,500
and met Mariah

16550
04:30:30,500 --> 04:30:31,620
in the landing place.

16551
04:30:31,620 --> 04:30:32,240
Who.

16552
04:30:32,240 --> 04:30:32,960
Breathless

16553
04:30:32,960 --> 04:30:34,100
with agitation,

16554
04:30:34,100 --> 04:30:35,300
cried out.

16555
04:30:35,300 --> 04:30:36,500
Oh, my dear Eliza,

16556
04:30:36,560 --> 04:30:37,380
pretty make haste

16557
04:30:37,380 --> 04:30:38,220
and come into the dining

16558
04:30:38,220 --> 04:30:38,540
room,

16559
04:30:38,540 --> 04:30:38,900
for there is

16560
04:30:38,900 --> 04:30:40,100
such a sight to be seen.

16561
04:30:40,200 --> 04:30:40,920
I will not tell.

16562
04:30:40,920 --> 04:30:41,700
You what it is.

16563
04:30:41,700 --> 04:30:42,740
Make haste and come down

16564
04:30:42,740 --> 04:30:43,940
this moment.

16565
04:30:44,060 --> 04:30:44,900
Elizabeth asked

16566
04:30:44,900 --> 04:30:46,100
questions in vain.

16567
04:30:46,100 --> 04:30:47,000
Mariah would tell her

16568
04:30:47,000 --> 04:30:48,380
nothing, and down

16569
04:30:48,380 --> 04:30:49,020
they ran into

16570
04:30:49,020 --> 04:30:49,640
the dining room,

16571
04:30:49,640 --> 04:30:50,520
which fronted the lane

16572
04:30:50,520 --> 04:30:51,720
In quest of this wonder.

16573
04:30:51,960 --> 04:30:53,060
It was two ladies

16574
04:30:53,060 --> 04:30:53,580
stopping in

16575
04:30:53,580 --> 04:30:54,300
a low phaeton

16576
04:30:54,300 --> 04:30:55,500
at the garden gate.

16577
04:30:55,920 --> 04:30:57,120
And is this all?

16578
04:30:57,140 --> 04:30:58,280
Cried Elizabeth.

16579
04:30:58,280 --> 04:30:59,660
I expected at least that

16580
04:30:59,660 --> 04:31:00,120
the pigs

16581
04:31:00,120 --> 04:31:00,540
would got into

16582
04:31:00,540 --> 04:31:01,260
the garden.

16583
04:31:01,260 --> 04:31:02,060
And here is nothing

16584
04:31:02,060 --> 04:31:02,880
but Lady Catherine

16585
04:31:02,880 --> 04:31:03,600
and her daughter.

16586
04:31:04,580 --> 04:31:05,780
Oh, my dear.

16587
04:31:05,820 --> 04:31:06,440
Said Mariah.

16588
04:31:06,440 --> 04:31:07,100
Quite shocked

16589
04:31:07,100 --> 04:31:08,040
at the mistake.

16590
04:31:08,040 --> 04:31:08,820
It is not Lady

16591
04:31:08,820 --> 04:31:09,440
Catherine.

16592
04:31:09,440 --> 04:31:10,620
The old lady is Mrs.

16593
04:31:10,620 --> 04:31:11,160
Jenkinson,

16594
04:31:11,160 --> 04:31:12,000
who lives with them.

16595
04:31:12,000 --> 04:31:13,140
The other is Mr.

16596
04:31:13,140 --> 04:31:13,800
Burke.

16597
04:31:13,800 --> 04:31:14,780
Only look at her.

16598
04:31:14,780 --> 04:31:15,120
She is

16599
04:31:15,120 --> 04:31:16,340
quite a little creature.

16600
04:31:16,620 --> 04:31:17,240
Who would have thought

16601
04:31:17,240 --> 04:31:17,720
that she could be

16602
04:31:17,720 --> 04:31:19,160
so thin and small?

16603
04:31:19,860 --> 04:31:21,020
She is abominably rude

16604
04:31:21,020 --> 04:31:21,720
to keep Charlotte

16605
04:31:21,720 --> 04:31:22,320
out of doors

16606
04:31:22,320 --> 04:31:23,480
and all this wind.

16607
04:31:23,480 --> 04:31:24,000
Why does won't

16608
04:31:24,000 --> 04:31:25,200
she come in?

16609
04:31:25,340 --> 04:31:26,060
Oh, Charlotte says

16610
04:31:26,060 --> 04:31:27,200
she hardly ever does.

16611
04:31:27,200 --> 04:31:28,260
It is the greatest

16612
04:31:28,260 --> 04:31:29,180
of favors when Mr.

16613
04:31:29,180 --> 04:31:30,380
Burg comes in.

16614
04:31:30,840 --> 04:31:32,180
I like her appearance.

16615
04:31:32,460 --> 04:31:33,540
Said Elizabeth, Struck

16616
04:31:33,540 --> 04:31:34,740
with other ideas.

16617
04:31:34,860 --> 04:31:35,820
She looks sickly

16618
04:31:35,820 --> 04:31:36,780
and cross.

16619
04:31:36,780 --> 04:31:38,520
Yes, she will do for him

16620
04:31:38,520 --> 04:31:39,560
very well.

16621
04:31:39,560 --> 04:31:40,280
She will make him

16622
04:31:40,280 --> 04:31:41,780
a very proper wife.

16623
04:31:42,840 --> 04:31:43,160
Mr.

16624
04:31:43,160 --> 04:31:44,180
Collins and Charlotte

16625
04:31:44,180 --> 04:31:44,940
were both standing

16626
04:31:44,940 --> 04:31:46,160
at the gate conversation

16627
04:31:46,160 --> 04:31:47,160
with the ladies

16628
04:31:47,160 --> 04:31:48,120
and Sir William

16629
04:31:48,120 --> 04:31:48,800
to Elizabeth's

16630
04:31:48,800 --> 04:31:49,980
high diversion.

16631
04:31:49,980 --> 04:31:50,640
Was stationed.

16632
04:31:50,640 --> 04:31:51,500
In the doorway

16633
04:31:51,500 --> 04:31:52,920
in earnest contemplation

16634
04:31:52,920 --> 04:31:53,480
of the greatness

16635
04:31:53,480 --> 04:31:54,240
before him.

16636
04:31:54,240 --> 04:31:54,480
And.

16637
04:31:54,480 --> 04:31:56,160
Constantly, whenever Mr.

16638
04:31:56,160 --> 04:31:57,380
Burg looked that way.

16639
04:31:58,260 --> 04:31:58,860
At length,

16640
04:31:58,860 --> 04:31:59,340
there was nothing

16641
04:31:59,340 --> 04:32:00,240
more to be said.

16642
04:32:00,240 --> 04:32:01,320
The ladies drove on

16643
04:32:01,320 --> 04:32:01,760
and the others

16644
04:32:01,760 --> 04:32:02,960
returned into the house.

16645
04:32:03,120 --> 04:32:03,440
Mr.

16646
04:32:03,440 --> 04:32:04,400
Collins no sooner

16647
04:32:04,400 --> 04:32:05,520
saw the two girls

16648
04:32:05,520 --> 04:32:06,060
than he began

16649
04:32:06,060 --> 04:32:07,080
to congratulate them

16650
04:32:07,080 --> 04:32:08,240
on their good fortune,

16651
04:32:08,240 --> 04:32:09,060
which Charlotte

16652
04:32:09,060 --> 04:32:09,780
explained by

16653
04:32:09,780 --> 04:32:10,500
letting them know

16654
04:32:10,500 --> 04:32:11,400
that the whole party

16655
04:32:11,400 --> 04:32:11,900
was asked to

16656
04:32:11,900 --> 04:32:12,860
dine at roses

16657
04:32:12,860 --> 04:32:13,800
the next day.

16658
04:32:15,500 --> 04:32:16,740
Chapter 29

16659
04:32:18,080 --> 04:32:18,480
Mr.

16660
04:32:18,480 --> 04:32:19,760
Collins is triumph in

16661
04:32:19,760 --> 04:32:20,480
consequence of

16662
04:32:20,480 --> 04:32:21,560
this invitation

16663
04:32:21,560 --> 04:32:22,760
was complete.

16664
04:32:22,820 --> 04:32:24,240
The power of displaying

16665
04:32:24,240 --> 04:32:24,860
the grandeur

16666
04:32:24,860 --> 04:32:25,740
of his patroness

16667
04:32:25,740 --> 04:32:26,000
to his

16668
04:32:26,000 --> 04:32:27,140
wandering visitors,

16669
04:32:27,140 --> 04:32:27,960
and of letting them

16670
04:32:27,960 --> 04:32:29,000
see her civility

16671
04:32:29,000 --> 04:32:29,900
towards himself

16672
04:32:29,900 --> 04:32:31,640
and his wife was exactly

16673
04:32:31,640 --> 04:32:32,840
what he had wished for.

16674
04:32:33,060 --> 04:32:33,660
And that

16675
04:32:33,660 --> 04:32:34,860
an opportunity of doing

16676
04:32:34,860 --> 04:32:35,720
it should be given so.

16677
04:32:35,720 --> 04:32:36,920
Soon was such

16678
04:32:36,920 --> 04:32:37,580
an instance.

16679
04:32:37,580 --> 04:32:37,940
Of Lady

16680
04:32:37,940 --> 04:32:38,520
Katherine's

16681
04:32:38,520 --> 04:32:40,040
condescension as he knew

16682
04:32:40,040 --> 04:32:41,220
not how to admire.

16683
04:32:41,220 --> 04:32:42,420
Enough.

16684
04:32:42,440 --> 04:32:43,640
I confess.

16685
04:32:43,920 --> 04:32:44,940
That he.

16686
04:32:44,940 --> 04:32:45,320
That I should

16687
04:32:45,320 --> 04:32:45,740
not have been

16688
04:32:45,740 --> 04:32:46,940
at all surprised by Her

16689
04:32:46,940 --> 04:32:47,580
Ladyship

16690
04:32:47,580 --> 04:32:48,800
asking us on Sunday

16691
04:32:48,800 --> 04:32:49,520
to drink tea

16692
04:32:49,520 --> 04:32:50,480
and spend the evening

16693
04:32:50,480 --> 04:32:51,680
at Rose Ings.

16694
04:32:51,920 --> 04:32:53,040
I rather expected

16695
04:32:53,040 --> 04:32:53,820
from my knowledge of,

16696
04:32:53,820 --> 04:32:54,860
her affability

16697
04:32:54,860 --> 04:32:56,060
that it would happen.

16698
04:32:56,280 --> 04:32:56,880
But who could

16699
04:32:56,880 --> 04:32:57,540
have foreseen

16700
04:32:57,540 --> 04:32:58,320
such an attention

16701
04:32:58,320 --> 04:32:59,300
as this?

16702
04:32:59,300 --> 04:32:59,820
Who could have

16703
04:32:59,820 --> 04:33:00,380
imagined that

16704
04:33:00,380 --> 04:33:01,080
we should receive

16705
04:33:01,080 --> 04:33:02,280
an invitation to dine?

16706
04:33:02,280 --> 04:33:02,540
There

16707
04:33:04,340 --> 04:33:06,080
and invitation moreover,

16708
04:33:06,200 --> 04:33:06,720
including

16709
04:33:06,720 --> 04:33:07,600
the whole party?

16710
04:33:07,600 --> 04:33:08,400
So immediately

16711
04:33:08,400 --> 04:33:09,600
after your arrival.

16712
04:33:11,160 --> 04:33:12,660
I am the less surprised

16713
04:33:12,660 --> 04:33:13,860
at what has happened.

16714
04:33:13,880 --> 04:33:15,080
Replied Sir William.

16715
04:33:15,360 --> 04:33:16,140
From that knowledge

16716
04:33:16,140 --> 04:33:16,400
of what

16717
04:33:16,400 --> 04:33:16,880
the manners

16718
04:33:16,880 --> 04:33:18,180
of the great really are,

16719
04:33:18,500 --> 04:33:19,760
which my situation

16720
04:33:19,760 --> 04:33:20,300
in life

16721
04:33:20,300 --> 04:33:20,900
has allowed me

16722
04:33:20,900 --> 04:33:22,100
to acquire

16723
04:33:22,980 --> 04:33:23,820
about the Court.

16724
04:33:23,820 --> 04:33:24,760
Such instances

16725
04:33:24,760 --> 04:33:25,740
of elegant breeding

16726
04:33:25,740 --> 04:33:26,940
are not uncommon.

16727
04:33:28,600 --> 04:33:29,220
Scarcely

16728
04:33:29,220 --> 04:33:30,300
anything was talked of.

16729
04:33:30,300 --> 04:33:31,020
The whole day

16730
04:33:31,020 --> 04:33:32,060
or next morning.

16731
04:33:32,060 --> 04:33:33,440
But their visit to Rose

16732
04:33:33,440 --> 04:33:34,500
Kings, Mr.

16733
04:33:34,500 --> 04:33:34,980
Collins

16734
04:33:34,980 --> 04:33:35,640
was carefully

16735
04:33:35,640 --> 04:33:36,320
instructing them

16736
04:33:36,320 --> 04:33:36,980
in what they were to.

16737
04:33:36,980 --> 04:33:37,880
Expect

16738
04:33:37,880 --> 04:33:38,720
that the sight of.

16739
04:33:38,720 --> 04:33:39,560
Such rooms,

16740
04:33:39,560 --> 04:33:40,520
so many servants

16741
04:33:40,520 --> 04:33:41,880
and so splendid a dinner

16742
04:33:42,100 --> 04:33:43,200
might not wholly

16743
04:33:43,200 --> 04:33:44,400
overpower them.

16744
04:33:44,580 --> 04:33:45,320
When the ladies

16745
04:33:45,320 --> 04:33:46,020
were separating

16746
04:33:46,020 --> 04:33:46,980
for the toilette,

16747
04:33:46,980 --> 04:33:48,180
he said to, Elizabeth.

16748
04:33:48,580 --> 04:33:49,100
Do not make

16749
04:33:49,100 --> 04:33:50,180
yourself uneasy, my dear

16750
04:33:50,180 --> 04:33:50,740
cousin, about

16751
04:33:50,740 --> 04:33:51,380
your apparel,

16752
04:33:52,500 --> 04:33:53,300
lady Catherine is

16753
04:33:53,300 --> 04:33:54,200
far from requiring

16754
04:33:54,200 --> 04:33:54,800
that elegance

16755
04:33:54,800 --> 04:33:55,560
of dress in us,

16756
04:33:55,560 --> 04:33:56,040
which becomes

16757
04:33:56,040 --> 04:33:57,240
herself and daughter.

16758
04:33:57,580 --> 04:33:58,320
I would advise

16759
04:33:58,320 --> 04:33:58,740
you merely

16760
04:33:58,740 --> 04:33:59,180
to put on

16761
04:33:59,180 --> 04:33:59,660
whatever of

16762
04:33:59,660 --> 04:34:01,020
your clothes is superior

16763
04:34:01,020 --> 04:34:02,220
to the rest.

16764
04:34:02,260 --> 04:34:03,240
There is no occasion

16765
04:34:03,240 --> 04:34:04,440
for anything more.

16766
04:34:04,580 --> 04:34:05,340
Lady Catherine

16767
04:34:05,340 --> 04:34:05,880
will not think

16768
04:34:05,880 --> 04:34:06,500
the worse of you

16769
04:34:06,500 --> 04:34:06,860
for being

16770
04:34:06,860 --> 04:34:08,060
simply dressed.

16771
04:34:08,180 --> 04:34:08,880
She likes to have

16772
04:34:08,880 --> 04:34:09,540
the distinction

16773
04:34:09,540 --> 04:34:10,740
of rank preserved.

16774
04:34:12,080 --> 04:34:12,680
While they were

16775
04:34:12,680 --> 04:34:13,380
dressing,

16776
04:34:13,380 --> 04:34:14,060
he came two

16777
04:34:14,060 --> 04:34:14,700
or three times

16778
04:34:14,700 --> 04:34:15,900
to their different doors

16779
04:34:15,980 --> 04:34:16,900
to recommend their

16780
04:34:16,900 --> 04:34:18,360
being quick as lady.

16781
04:34:18,360 --> 04:34:19,280
Catherine very much

16782
04:34:19,280 --> 04:34:20,240
objected to be kept

16783
04:34:20,240 --> 04:34:21,440
waiting for her dinner.

16784
04:34:21,860 --> 04:34:22,800
Such formidable

16785
04:34:22,800 --> 04:34:24,000
accounts of her Ladyship

16786
04:34:24,080 --> 04:34:24,400
and her

16787
04:34:24,400 --> 04:34:25,460
manner of living.

16788
04:34:25,460 --> 04:34:26,360
Quite frightened

16789
04:34:26,360 --> 04:34:27,300
Maria Lucas,

16790
04:34:27,300 --> 04:34:27,900
who had been little

16791
04:34:27,900 --> 04:34:28,940
used to company

16792
04:34:28,940 --> 04:34:29,960
and she looked forward

16793
04:34:29,960 --> 04:34:30,680
to her introduction

16794
04:34:30,680 --> 04:34:31,280
at Rose, sings

16795
04:34:31,280 --> 04:34:31,580
with as

16796
04:34:31,580 --> 04:34:32,480
much apprehension

16797
04:34:32,480 --> 04:34:33,680
as her father had done

16798
04:34:33,800 --> 04:34:34,880
to his presentation.

16799
04:34:34,880 --> 04:34:36,080
At St James's.

16800
04:34:36,620 --> 04:34:37,820
As the weather was fine.

16801
04:34:38,000 --> 04:34:38,780
They had a pleasant

16802
04:34:38,780 --> 04:34:39,240
walk of

16803
04:34:39,240 --> 04:34:40,080
about half a mile

16804
04:34:40,080 --> 04:34:41,280
across the park.

16805
04:34:41,400 --> 04:34:42,200
Every park

16806
04:34:42,200 --> 04:34:43,080
has its beauty

16807
04:34:43,080 --> 04:34:44,280
and its prospects

16808
04:34:44,460 --> 04:34:45,100
and Elizabeth,

16809
04:34:45,100 --> 04:34:45,900
so much to be

16810
04:34:45,900 --> 04:34:46,820
pleased with.

16811
04:34:46,820 --> 04:34:47,220
Though she.

16812
04:34:47,220 --> 04:34:47,900
Could not be in

16813
04:34:47,900 --> 04:34:49,200
such raptures as Mr.

16814
04:34:49,200 --> 04:34:50,080
Collins expected

16815
04:34:50,080 --> 04:34:51,300
the scene to inspire.

16816
04:34:51,580 --> 04:34:51,860
And.

16817
04:34:51,860 --> 04:34:52,280
Was but

16818
04:34:52,280 --> 04:34:53,240
slightly affected

16819
04:34:53,240 --> 04:34:54,200
by his enumeration

16820
04:34:54,200 --> 04:34:54,900
of the windows

16821
04:34:54,900 --> 04:34:55,980
in front of the house

16822
04:34:55,980 --> 04:34:56,880
and relation

16823
04:34:56,880 --> 04:34:57,100
of what

16824
04:34:57,100 --> 04:34:57,740
the glazing

16825
04:34:57,740 --> 04:34:58,400
altogether had

16826
04:34:58,400 --> 04:34:59,460
originally costs

16827
04:34:59,460 --> 04:35:00,660
or Louis to Bourg.

16828
04:35:01,040 --> 04:35:01,820
When they ascended

16829
04:35:01,820 --> 04:35:03,020
the steps to the hall.

16830
04:35:03,080 --> 04:35:03,680
Maria's

16831
04:35:03,680 --> 04:35:04,640
alarm was every

16832
04:35:04,640 --> 04:35:05,840
moment increasing,

16833
04:35:05,880 --> 04:35:06,960
and even Sir William

16834
04:35:06,960 --> 04:35:07,500
did not look

16835
04:35:07,500 --> 04:35:08,700
perfectly calm.

16836
04:35:08,840 --> 04:35:09,860
Elizabeth's courage

16837
04:35:09,860 --> 04:35:11,060
did not fail her.

16838
04:35:11,240 --> 04:35:11,920
She had heard

16839
04:35:11,920 --> 04:35:12,720
nothing of Lady

16840
04:35:12,720 --> 04:35:13,140
Catherine

16841
04:35:13,140 --> 04:35:14,220
that spoke her awful

16842
04:35:14,220 --> 04:35:14,580
from any

16843
04:35:14,580 --> 04:35:15,760
extraordinary talents,

16844
04:35:15,760 --> 04:35:16,980
miraculous virtue,

16845
04:35:17,220 --> 04:35:18,260
and the mere stateliness

16846
04:35:18,260 --> 04:35:19,220
of money or rank

16847
04:35:19,220 --> 04:35:19,820
she thought she

16848
04:35:19,820 --> 04:35:20,420
could witness

16849
04:35:20,420 --> 04:35:21,720
without trepidation.

16850
04:35:22,640 --> 04:35:23,420
From the entrance

16851
04:35:23,420 --> 04:35:24,400
hall, of which Mr.

16852
04:35:24,400 --> 04:35:25,580
Collins pointed out

16853
04:35:25,580 --> 04:35:26,720
a rapturous air,

16854
04:35:26,720 --> 04:35:27,860
the fine proportion

16855
04:35:27,860 --> 04:35:28,020
and the

16856
04:35:28,020 --> 04:35:29,220
finished ornaments.

16857
04:35:29,220 --> 04:35:29,720
They followed

16858
04:35:29,720 --> 04:35:30,240
the servants

16859
04:35:30,240 --> 04:35:31,240
through an antechamber

16860
04:35:31,240 --> 04:35:31,760
to the room

16861
04:35:31,760 --> 04:35:32,840
where Lady Catherine,

16862
04:35:32,840 --> 04:35:33,920
her daughter, and Mrs.

16863
04:35:33,920 --> 04:35:35,120
Jenkinson, were sitting.

16864
04:35:35,420 --> 04:35:36,180
Her ladyship,

16865
04:35:36,180 --> 04:35:36,760
with great

16866
04:35:36,760 --> 04:35:37,880
condescension, arose

16867
04:35:37,880 --> 04:35:38,920
to receive them,

16868
04:35:38,920 --> 04:35:39,580
and as Mrs.

16869
04:35:39,580 --> 04:35:40,500
Collins had settled it

16870
04:35:40,500 --> 04:35:41,160
with her husband,

16871
04:35:41,160 --> 04:35:41,780
that the office

16872
04:35:41,780 --> 04:35:42,480
of Introduction

16873
04:35:42,480 --> 04:35:43,520
should be hers.

16874
04:35:43,520 --> 04:35:44,420
It was performed

16875
04:35:44,420 --> 04:35:45,500
in a proper manner,

16876
04:35:45,500 --> 04:35:46,220
without any

16877
04:35:46,220 --> 04:35:47,000
of those apologies

16878
04:35:47,000 --> 04:35:47,580
and thanks,

16879
04:35:47,580 --> 04:35:48,180
which he would have

16880
04:35:48,180 --> 04:35:49,380
thought necessary.

16881
04:35:49,800 --> 04:35:50,700
In spite of having

16882
04:35:50,700 --> 04:35:52,080
been at St James's, Sir

16883
04:35:52,080 --> 04:35:52,740
William was so

16884
04:35:52,740 --> 04:35:53,700
completely awed

16885
04:35:53,700 --> 04:35:54,320
by the grandeur

16886
04:35:54,320 --> 04:35:54,840
surrounding.

16887
04:35:54,840 --> 04:35:55,900
Him that he had,

16888
04:35:55,900 --> 04:35:56,720
but just carriage

16889
04:35:56,720 --> 04:35:57,000
enough.

16890
04:35:57,000 --> 04:35:58,200
To make a very low bow

16891
04:35:58,380 --> 04:35:59,260
and to take his seat

16892
04:35:59,260 --> 04:36:00,480
without saying a word.

16893
04:36:00,680 --> 04:36:00,900
At.

16894
04:36:00,900 --> 04:36:02,160
His daughter, frightened

16895
04:36:02,160 --> 04:36:02,720
almost out

16896
04:36:02,720 --> 04:36:03,680
of her senses.

16897
04:36:03,680 --> 04:36:04,100
Sat.

16898
04:36:04,100 --> 04:36:05,300
On the edge of chair,

16899
04:36:05,340 --> 04:36:06,060
not knowing

16900
04:36:06,060 --> 04:36:07,260
which way to look.

16901
04:36:07,580 --> 04:36:08,720
Elizabeth found herself

16902
04:36:08,720 --> 04:36:10,020
quite equal to the scene

16903
04:36:10,220 --> 04:36:11,060
and could observe

16904
04:36:11,060 --> 04:36:11,740
the three ladies

16905
04:36:11,740 --> 04:36:12,320
before her

16906
04:36:12,320 --> 04:36:13,520
composed oddly.

16907
04:36:13,580 --> 04:36:14,520
Lady Catherine,

16908
04:36:14,520 --> 04:36:15,800
a tall, large woman

16909
04:36:15,980 --> 04:36:16,940
with strongly marked.

16910
04:36:16,940 --> 04:36:17,660
Features

16911
04:36:17,660 --> 04:36:18,620
which might once.

16912
04:36:18,620 --> 04:36:19,820
Have been handsome.

16913
04:36:20,040 --> 04:36:20,720
Her heir was

16914
04:36:20,720 --> 04:36:21,920
not consolidating,

16915
04:36:22,140 --> 04:36:23,000
nor was her manner

16916
04:36:23,000 --> 04:36:23,720
of receiving them

16917
04:36:23,720 --> 04:36:24,440
Such to make

16918
04:36:24,440 --> 04:36:24,980
her visitors

16919
04:36:24,980 --> 04:36:26,180
forget their inferior

16920
04:36:26,180 --> 04:36:27,080
rank.

16921
04:36:27,080 --> 04:36:27,980
She was not rendered

16922
04:36:27,980 --> 04:36:29,260
formidable by silence.

16923
04:36:29,580 --> 04:36:30,620
But whatever she said

16924
04:36:30,620 --> 04:36:31,240
was spoken in

16925
04:36:31,240 --> 04:36:32,160
so authoritative

16926
04:36:32,160 --> 04:36:33,760
a tone as marked herself

16927
04:36:34,580 --> 04:36:35,400
and brought Mr.

16928
04:36:35,400 --> 04:36:36,320
Wickham immediately

16929
04:36:36,320 --> 04:36:37,520
to Elizabeth's mind.

16930
04:36:37,700 --> 04:36:38,820
And from the observation

16931
04:36:38,820 --> 04:36:40,020
of the day altogether.

16932
04:36:40,100 --> 04:36:40,700
She believed

16933
04:36:40,700 --> 04:36:41,360
Lady Katharine

16934
04:36:41,360 --> 04:36:42,380
to be exactly.

16935
04:36:42,380 --> 04:36:43,580
What he represented.

16936
04:36:44,220 --> 04:36:45,180
When, after

16937
04:36:45,180 --> 04:36:46,380
examining the mother

16938
04:36:46,420 --> 04:36:47,540
in whose countenance

16939
04:36:47,540 --> 04:36:48,380
and deportment

16940
04:36:48,380 --> 04:36:49,200
she soon found

16941
04:36:49,200 --> 04:36:50,340
some resemblance of Mr.

16942
04:36:50,340 --> 04:36:50,920
Darcy.

16943
04:36:50,920 --> 04:36:51,580
She turned her

16944
04:36:51,580 --> 04:36:52,800
eyes on the daughter

16945
04:36:52,860 --> 04:36:54,020
she could have joined

16946
04:36:54,020 --> 04:36:54,500
in rise

16947
04:36:54,500 --> 04:36:55,400
astonishment at her

16948
04:36:55,400 --> 04:36:56,240
being so thin.

16949
04:36:56,240 --> 04:36:57,440
And so small.

16950
04:36:57,560 --> 04:36:57,900
There was

16951
04:36:57,900 --> 04:36:58,740
neither in figure

16952
04:36:58,740 --> 04:37:00,200
nor face any likeness

16953
04:37:00,200 --> 04:37:01,400
between the ladies.

16954
04:37:01,460 --> 04:37:01,860
Mr.

16955
04:37:01,860 --> 04:37:02,820
Bourg was pale

16956
04:37:02,820 --> 04:37:03,740
and sickly.

16957
04:37:03,740 --> 04:37:04,740
Her features, though

16958
04:37:04,740 --> 04:37:05,600
not plain,

16959
04:37:05,600 --> 04:37:06,800
were insignificant,

16960
04:37:06,840 --> 04:37:07,560
and she spoke

16961
04:37:07,560 --> 04:37:08,420
very little,

16962
04:37:08,420 --> 04:37:09,720
except in a low voice

16963
04:37:09,720 --> 04:37:10,080
to Mrs..

16964
04:37:10,080 --> 04:37:11,340
Jenkinson, in whose.

16965
04:37:11,340 --> 04:37:11,820
Appearance

16966
04:37:11,820 --> 04:37:12,060
there was

16967
04:37:12,060 --> 04:37:13,100
nothing remarkable,

16968
04:37:13,100 --> 04:37:13,580
and who was

16969
04:37:13,580 --> 04:37:14,540
entirely engaged

16970
04:37:14,540 --> 04:37:15,020
in listening

16971
04:37:15,020 --> 04:37:15,980
to what she said

16972
04:37:15,980 --> 04:37:17,240
and placing a screen

16973
04:37:17,240 --> 04:37:18,180
in the proper direction

16974
04:37:18,180 --> 04:37:19,380
before her eyes.

16975
04:37:19,740 --> 04:37:20,400
After sitting

16976
04:37:20,400 --> 04:37:21,180
a few minutes,

16977
04:37:21,180 --> 04:37:22,040
they were all sent

16978
04:37:22,040 --> 04:37:22,900
to one of the windows

16979
04:37:22,900 --> 04:37:24,060
to admire the view.

16980
04:37:24,060 --> 04:37:24,380
Mr.

16981
04:37:24,380 --> 04:37:24,840
Collins

16982
04:37:24,840 --> 04:37:25,560
attending them

16983
04:37:25,560 --> 04:37:26,180
to point out

16984
04:37:26,180 --> 04:37:27,560
its beauties, and Lady

16985
04:37:27,560 --> 04:37:28,500
Catherine kindly

16986
04:37:28,500 --> 04:37:29,420
informing them

16987
04:37:29,420 --> 04:37:30,020
that it was much

16988
04:37:30,020 --> 04:37:30,500
better worth

16989
04:37:30,500 --> 04:37:31,080
looking at

16990
04:37:31,080 --> 04:37:31,700
in the summer.

16991
04:37:32,720 --> 04:37:33,320
The dinner was

16992
04:37:33,320 --> 04:37:34,520
exceedingly handsome

16993
04:37:34,560 --> 04:37:35,040
and there were

16994
04:37:35,040 --> 04:37:35,840
all the servants

16995
04:37:35,840 --> 04:37:36,260
and all the

16996
04:37:36,260 --> 04:37:37,100
articles of plate,

16997
04:37:37,100 --> 04:37:37,460
which Mr.

16998
04:37:37,460 --> 04:37:38,660
Collins had promised,

16999
04:37:38,740 --> 04:37:39,380
and as he had

17000
04:37:39,380 --> 04:37:40,580
likewise foretold.

17001
04:37:40,580 --> 04:37:41,080
He took his.

17002
04:37:41,080 --> 04:37:41,840
Seat at the bottom

17003
04:37:41,840 --> 04:37:42,620
of the table.

17004
04:37:42,620 --> 04:37:43,820
Her lady ships desire,

17005
04:37:44,040 --> 04:37:45,080
and looked as if he felt

17006
04:37:45,080 --> 04:37:46,040
that life could furnish

17007
04:37:46,040 --> 04:37:47,240
nothing greater.

17008
04:37:47,360 --> 04:37:48,580
He carved and ate

17009
04:37:48,760 --> 04:37:49,520
and praised

17010
04:37:49,520 --> 04:37:50,820
with delighted alacrity,

17011
04:37:51,140 --> 04:37:52,080
and every dish

17012
04:37:52,080 --> 04:37:53,000
was commended,

17013
04:37:53,000 --> 04:37:53,960
first by him

17014
04:37:53,960 --> 04:37:55,200
and then by Sir William,

17015
04:37:55,420 --> 04:37:55,980
who was now

17016
04:37:55,980 --> 04:37:57,000
enough for cover to echo

17017
04:37:57,000 --> 04:37:57,920
whatever his son in law

17018
04:37:57,920 --> 04:37:59,160
said, in a manner

17019
04:37:59,160 --> 04:37:59,720
which Elizabeth

17020
04:37:59,720 --> 04:38:00,440
wondered Lady

17021
04:38:00,440 --> 04:38:01,640
Catherine could bear.

17022
04:38:01,860 --> 04:38:02,360
But Lady

17023
04:38:02,360 --> 04:38:02,780
Catherine

17024
04:38:02,780 --> 04:38:03,720
seemed gratified

17025
04:38:03,720 --> 04:38:04,040
by their

17026
04:38:04,040 --> 04:38:05,260
excessive admiration

17027
04:38:05,520 --> 04:38:05,960
and gave

17028
04:38:05,960 --> 04:38:07,340
most gracious smiles,

17029
04:38:07,600 --> 04:38:08,960
especially when any dish

17030
04:38:08,960 --> 04:38:09,560
on the table

17031
04:38:09,560 --> 04:38:10,600
proved a novelty

17032
04:38:10,600 --> 04:38:11,700
to them.

17033
04:38:11,700 --> 04:38:12,960
The did not supply

17034
04:38:12,960 --> 04:38:14,160
much conversation.

17035
04:38:14,340 --> 04:38:15,260
Elizabeth was ready

17036
04:38:15,260 --> 04:38:15,720
to speak

17037
04:38:15,720 --> 04:38:16,160
whenever there

17038
04:38:16,160 --> 04:38:17,040
was an opening.

17039
04:38:17,040 --> 04:38:17,840
But she was seated.

17040
04:38:17,840 --> 04:38:18,660
Between Charlotte

17041
04:38:18,660 --> 04:38:19,140
and Mr.

17042
04:38:19,140 --> 04:38:19,800
Burke,

17043
04:38:19,800 --> 04:38:20,480
the former of

17044
04:38:20,480 --> 04:38:21,300
whom was engaged

17045
04:38:21,300 --> 04:38:21,740
in, listening

17046
04:38:21,740 --> 04:38:22,760
to Lady Catherine,

17047
04:38:22,760 --> 04:38:23,740
and the latter said

17048
04:38:23,740 --> 04:38:24,660
not a word to her

17049
04:38:24,660 --> 04:38:25,860
all dinnertime.

17050
04:38:26,180 --> 04:38:26,520
Mrs.

17051
04:38:26,520 --> 04:38:27,020
Jenkinson

17052
04:38:27,020 --> 04:38:27,980
was chiefly employed

17053
04:38:27,980 --> 04:38:28,560
in watching

17054
04:38:28,560 --> 04:38:29,260
how little Mr.

17055
04:38:29,260 --> 04:38:30,680
Burke ate, pressing her

17056
04:38:30,680 --> 04:38:31,880
to try other dish

17057
04:38:31,900 --> 04:38:32,600
and fearing

17058
04:38:32,600 --> 04:38:33,800
she was indisposed.

17059
04:38:34,160 --> 04:38:35,080
Maria thought,

17060
04:38:35,080 --> 04:38:35,780
speaking out of the.

17061
04:38:35,780 --> 04:38:36,740
Question and the.

17062
04:38:36,740 --> 04:38:37,800
Gentleman did nothing

17063
04:38:37,800 --> 04:38:39,100
but eat and admire.

17064
04:38:40,140 --> 04:38:40,420
When the

17065
04:38:40,420 --> 04:38:41,080
ladies

17066
04:38:41,080 --> 04:38:42,020
to the drawing room,

17067
04:38:42,020 --> 04:38:42,560
there was little

17068
04:38:42,560 --> 04:38:43,080
to be done.

17069
04:38:43,080 --> 04:38:43,800
But to hear Lady

17070
04:38:43,800 --> 04:38:44,820
Catherine talk.

17071
04:38:44,820 --> 04:38:45,720
Which she did.

17072
04:38:45,720 --> 04:38:46,740
Without any intermission

17073
04:38:46,740 --> 04:38:47,940
until coffee came in,

17074
04:38:48,020 --> 04:38:49,040
delivering her opinion

17075
04:38:49,040 --> 04:38:49,980
on every subject

17076
04:38:49,980 --> 04:38:51,320
and so decisive a manner

17077
04:38:51,500 --> 04:38:52,040
as proved

17078
04:38:52,040 --> 04:38:52,880
that she was not used

17079
04:38:52,880 --> 04:38:53,160
to have

17080
04:38:53,160 --> 04:38:53,880
her judgment

17081
04:38:53,880 --> 04:38:54,980
introverted.

17082
04:38:54,980 --> 04:38:55,680
She inquired

17083
04:38:55,680 --> 04:38:56,240
into Charlotte's

17084
04:38:56,240 --> 04:38:57,100
domestic concerns

17085
04:38:57,100 --> 04:38:58,500
familiarly and minutely

17086
04:38:58,800 --> 04:38:59,780
gave her a great deal

17087
04:38:59,780 --> 04:39:00,300
of advice

17088
04:39:00,300 --> 04:39:00,580
as to the

17089
04:39:00,580 --> 04:39:01,800
management of them all,

17090
04:39:01,880 --> 04:39:02,840
told her how everything

17091
04:39:02,840 --> 04:39:03,680
ought to be regulated

17092
04:39:03,680 --> 04:39:04,760
in so small a family

17093
04:39:04,760 --> 04:39:05,540
as hers,

17094
04:39:05,540 --> 04:39:06,440
and instructed her

17095
04:39:06,440 --> 04:39:06,980
as to the care

17096
04:39:06,980 --> 04:39:07,580
of her cows

17097
04:39:07,580 --> 04:39:08,780
and her poultry.

17098
04:39:08,780 --> 04:39:09,620
Elizabeth found

17099
04:39:09,620 --> 04:39:10,560
that nothing was beneath

17100
04:39:10,560 --> 04:39:10,980
this great

17101
04:39:10,980 --> 04:39:11,960
lady's attention,

17102
04:39:11,960 --> 04:39:12,760
which could furniture

17103
04:39:12,760 --> 04:39:13,380
with an occasion

17104
04:39:13,380 --> 04:39:14,700
of dictating to others.

17105
04:39:15,180 --> 04:39:15,360
In.

17106
04:39:15,360 --> 04:39:15,900
The intervals

17107
04:39:15,900 --> 04:39:16,860
of her discourse of Mrs.

17108
04:39:16,860 --> 04:39:17,580
Collins.

17109
04:39:17,580 --> 04:39:18,620
She addressed a variety

17110
04:39:18,620 --> 04:39:19,160
of questions

17111
04:39:19,160 --> 04:39:20,360
to Maria and Elizabeth.

17112
04:39:20,580 --> 04:39:21,300
But especially.

17113
04:39:21,300 --> 04:39:22,200
To the latter

17114
04:39:22,200 --> 04:39:23,100
of whose connection

17115
04:39:23,100 --> 04:39:24,100
she knew the least.

17116
04:39:24,100 --> 04:39:25,080
And who she. Observed.

17117
04:39:25,080 --> 04:39:25,340
Mrs.

17118
04:39:25,340 --> 04:39:25,900
Collins was a

17119
04:39:25,900 --> 04:39:26,720
very genteel,

17120
04:39:26,720 --> 04:39:27,920
pretty kind of girl.

17121
04:39:28,100 --> 04:39:28,800
She asked her

17122
04:39:28,800 --> 04:39:29,640
at different times

17123
04:39:29,640 --> 04:39:30,300
how many sisters

17124
04:39:30,300 --> 04:39:30,960
she had,

17125
04:39:30,960 --> 04:39:31,760
whether They were older

17126
04:39:31,760 --> 04:39:32,960
or younger than herself,

17127
04:39:33,100 --> 04:39:33,900
whether any of them

17128
04:39:33,900 --> 04:39:34,340
were likely

17129
04:39:34,340 --> 04:39:35,260
to be married,

17130
04:39:35,260 --> 04:39:35,720
whether they

17131
04:39:35,720 --> 04:39:36,480
were handsome,

17132
04:39:36,480 --> 04:39:36,960
whether they had

17133
04:39:36,960 --> 04:39:37,820
been educated,

17134
04:39:37,820 --> 04:39:38,640
what carriage

17135
04:39:38,640 --> 04:39:39,540
her father kept,

17136
04:39:39,540 --> 04:39:40,100
and what had been

17137
04:39:40,100 --> 04:39:40,560
her mother's

17138
04:39:40,560 --> 04:39:41,760
maiden name.

17139
04:39:41,880 --> 04:39:42,760
Elizabeth felt

17140
04:39:42,760 --> 04:39:43,700
all the impertinence

17141
04:39:43,700 --> 04:39:44,640
of her questions,

17142
04:39:44,640 --> 04:39:45,480
but answered them

17143
04:39:45,480 --> 04:39:46,680
very composed, oddly.

17144
04:39:46,940 --> 04:39:47,700
Lady Catherine

17145
04:39:47,700 --> 04:39:48,900
then observed.

17146
04:39:49,100 --> 04:39:50,720
Your father's estate

17147
04:39:50,720 --> 04:39:52,040
is entailed on Mr.

17148
04:39:52,040 --> 04:39:53,240
Collins, I think,

17149
04:39:53,520 --> 04:39:54,720
for your sake.

17150
04:39:54,900 --> 04:39:56,100
Turning to Charlotte.

17151
04:39:56,160 --> 04:39:57,540
I am glad of it.

17152
04:39:57,860 --> 04:39:58,760
But otherwise

17153
04:39:58,760 --> 04:39:59,920
I see no occasion

17154
04:39:59,920 --> 04:40:01,220
for entailing estates

17155
04:40:01,220 --> 04:40:02,540
from the female line.

17156
04:40:02,900 --> 04:40:03,800
It was not thought

17157
04:40:03,800 --> 04:40:05,180
necessary in Sir Louis

17158
04:40:05,180 --> 04:40:06,380
De Berg's family.

17159
04:40:07,220 --> 04:40:08,780
Do you play and sing,

17160
04:40:08,780 --> 04:40:09,980
Miss Bennett?

17161
04:40:10,240 --> 04:40:12,200
A little, No.

17162
04:40:12,560 --> 04:40:13,740
Then sometime or other,

17163
04:40:13,740 --> 04:40:14,220
we shall be

17164
04:40:14,220 --> 04:40:15,500
happy to hear you.

17165
04:40:15,900 --> 04:40:16,800
Our instrument

17166
04:40:16,800 --> 04:40:18,000
is a capital one.

17167
04:40:18,180 --> 04:40:19,380
Well, probably superior

17168
04:40:19,380 --> 04:40:20,580
to you.

17169
04:40:20,580 --> 04:40:22,340
Shall try it someday.

17170
04:40:22,880 --> 04:40:23,960
Do your sisters

17171
04:40:23,960 --> 04:40:25,400
play and sing?

17172
04:40:26,240 --> 04:40:26,780
One of them

17173
04:40:26,780 --> 04:40:27,980
does.

17174
04:40:27,980 --> 04:40:28,880
Why did not

17175
04:40:28,880 --> 04:40:29,960
you all done?

17176
04:40:29,960 --> 04:40:30,840
You walked

17177
04:40:30,840 --> 04:40:32,040
to have learned

17178
04:40:32,060 --> 04:40:32,580
the Miss

17179
04:40:32,580 --> 04:40:33,980
Webb's old play.

17180
04:40:33,980 --> 04:40:35,080
And their father

17181
04:40:35,080 --> 04:40:36,000
has not so good

17182
04:40:36,000 --> 04:40:37,240
an income as yours.

17183
04:40:37,820 --> 04:40:39,020
Do you draw?

17184
04:40:39,580 --> 04:40:40,800
No, not at all.

17185
04:40:41,520 --> 04:40:42,480
Oh, what?

17186
04:40:42,480 --> 04:40:43,680
None of you.

17187
04:40:44,120 --> 04:40:44,880
Not one.

17188
04:40:45,840 --> 04:40:46,400
That is

17189
04:40:46,400 --> 04:40:47,900
very strange.

17190
04:40:48,400 --> 04:40:49,460
But I suppose

17191
04:40:49,460 --> 04:40:51,020
you had opportunity.

17192
04:40:51,480 --> 04:40:52,380
Your mother should

17193
04:40:52,380 --> 04:40:52,880
have taken you

17194
04:40:52,880 --> 04:40:54,620
to town every spring

17195
04:40:54,620 --> 04:40:54,900
for the

17196
04:40:54,900 --> 04:40:56,520
benefit of Masters.

17197
04:40:57,380 --> 04:40:58,220
My mother would have

17198
04:40:58,220 --> 04:40:59,420
had no objection.

17199
04:40:59,420 --> 04:41:00,560
But my father hates

17200
04:41:00,560 --> 04:41:01,760
London.

17201
04:41:02,000 --> 04:41:03,140
Has your governess

17202
04:41:03,140 --> 04:41:04,340
left you?

17203
04:41:04,680 --> 04:41:05,360
We never had

17204
04:41:05,360 --> 04:41:06,560
any governess.

17205
04:41:06,960 --> 04:41:08,340
No governess.

17206
04:41:08,700 --> 04:41:10,020
How was that possible?

17207
04:41:10,380 --> 04:41:11,700
Five daughters

17208
04:41:11,700 --> 04:41:12,500
brought up at home

17209
04:41:12,500 --> 04:41:13,740
without a governess.

17210
04:41:14,040 --> 04:41:15,080
I never heard

17211
04:41:15,080 --> 04:41:16,280
of such a thing.

17212
04:41:16,380 --> 04:41:17,180
Your mother must

17213
04:41:17,180 --> 04:41:18,500
have been quite a slave

17214
04:41:18,540 --> 04:41:19,740
to education.

17215
04:41:20,540 --> 04:41:21,100
Elizabeth

17216
04:41:21,100 --> 04:41:21,580
could hardly

17217
04:41:21,580 --> 04:41:22,340
help, smiling

17218
04:41:22,340 --> 04:41:23,220
as she assured her that

17219
04:41:23,220 --> 04:41:23,900
that had not

17220
04:41:23,900 --> 04:41:25,100
been the case.

17221
04:41:25,460 --> 04:41:26,820
Then who taught you?

17222
04:41:27,100 --> 04:41:28,520
Who attended to you

17223
04:41:28,760 --> 04:41:29,900
without a governess,

17224
04:41:29,900 --> 04:41:30,360
you must have

17225
04:41:30,360 --> 04:41:31,560
been neglected.

17226
04:41:32,520 --> 04:41:32,920
Compared

17227
04:41:32,920 --> 04:41:33,840
with some families,

17228
04:41:33,840 --> 04:41:35,040
I believe we were.

17229
04:41:35,120 --> 04:41:36,020
But such of us

17230
04:41:36,020 --> 04:41:36,760
as wish to learn.

17231
04:41:36,760 --> 04:41:37,420
Never wanted the.

17232
04:41:37,420 --> 04:41:38,220
Means.

17233
04:41:38,220 --> 04:41:38,900
We were always

17234
04:41:38,900 --> 04:41:40,100
encouraged to read

17235
04:41:40,140 --> 04:41:41,520
and had all the masters

17236
04:41:41,520 --> 04:41:42,720
that were necessary.

17237
04:41:42,860 --> 04:41:43,760
Those who chose

17238
04:41:43,760 --> 04:41:44,360
to be idle

17239
04:41:44,360 --> 04:41:45,560
certainly might.

17240
04:41:46,020 --> 04:41:47,360
Oh, I no doubt.

17241
04:41:47,360 --> 04:41:48,240
But that is what a

17242
04:41:48,240 --> 04:41:49,460
governess prevent.

17243
04:41:49,680 --> 04:41:51,020
And if I had known

17244
04:41:51,020 --> 04:41:51,740
your mother,

17245
04:41:51,740 --> 04:41:52,280
I should have

17246
04:41:52,280 --> 04:41:52,880
advised her

17247
04:41:52,880 --> 04:41:54,240
most strenuously

17248
04:41:54,240 --> 04:41:55,440
to engage one.

17249
04:41:55,640 --> 04:41:57,060
I always say that

17250
04:41:57,060 --> 04:41:58,040
nothing is to be done

17251
04:41:58,040 --> 04:41:58,640
in education

17252
04:41:58,640 --> 04:41:59,420
without steady

17253
04:41:59,420 --> 04:42:01,020
and regular instruction,

17254
04:42:01,240 --> 04:42:02,240
and nobody but

17255
04:42:02,240 --> 04:42:03,560
a governess can give it.

17256
04:42:04,200 --> 04:42:05,640
It is wonderful

17257
04:42:05,640 --> 04:42:06,580
how many families

17258
04:42:06,580 --> 04:42:06,980
I have been

17259
04:42:06,980 --> 04:42:07,320
the means

17260
04:42:07,320 --> 04:42:08,080
of supplying

17261
04:42:08,080 --> 04:42:09,260
in that way.

17262
04:42:09,260 --> 04:42:10,240
I am always

17263
04:42:10,240 --> 04:42:11,080
glad to get

17264
04:42:11,080 --> 04:42:11,920
a young person

17265
04:42:11,920 --> 04:42:13,280
well placed out

17266
04:42:13,800 --> 04:42:15,060
for nieces of Mrs.

17267
04:42:15,060 --> 04:42:16,040
Jenkinson are most

17268
04:42:16,040 --> 04:42:17,420
delightfully situated

17269
04:42:17,420 --> 04:42:18,620
through my.

17270
04:42:18,900 --> 04:42:19,520
And it was.

17271
04:42:19,520 --> 04:42:20,260
But the other day

17272
04:42:20,260 --> 04:42:21,060
that I recommended

17273
04:42:21,060 --> 04:42:22,260
another young person

17274
04:42:22,420 --> 04:42:22,740
who was

17275
04:42:22,740 --> 04:42:23,920
merely accidentally

17276
04:42:23,920 --> 04:42:25,140
mentioned to me,

17277
04:42:25,220 --> 04:42:26,820
and the family are quite

17278
04:42:26,820 --> 04:42:28,020
delighted with her.

17279
04:42:28,380 --> 04:42:28,820
Mrs.

17280
04:42:28,820 --> 04:42:29,400
Collins,

17281
04:42:29,400 --> 04:42:30,140
did I tell you

17282
04:42:30,140 --> 04:42:30,560
of Lady

17283
04:42:30,560 --> 04:42:31,280
Metcalf's

17284
04:42:31,280 --> 04:42:32,180
calling yesterday

17285
04:42:32,180 --> 04:42:33,260
to thank me?

17286
04:42:33,260 --> 04:42:34,460
She finds Mr.

17287
04:42:34,460 --> 04:42:35,720
Pope a treasure.

17288
04:42:36,260 --> 04:42:38,460
Lady Katherine said she.

17289
04:42:38,660 --> 04:42:39,660
You have given

17290
04:42:39,660 --> 04:42:41,060
me a treasure.

17291
04:42:42,060 --> 04:42:43,020
Are any of your younger

17292
04:42:43,020 --> 04:42:44,420
sisters out, Miss

17293
04:42:44,420 --> 04:42:45,640
Bennett?

17294
04:42:45,840 --> 04:42:46,640
Yes, ma'am.

17295
04:42:46,640 --> 04:42:50,020
All All what?

17296
04:42:50,420 --> 04:42:51,960
All five out

17297
04:42:51,960 --> 04:42:53,160
at once.

17298
04:42:53,360 --> 04:42:54,620
Very odd.

17299
04:42:54,860 --> 04:42:55,560
And you?

17300
04:42:55,560 --> 04:42:56,760
Only the second

17301
04:42:57,060 --> 04:42:58,380
the ones out

17302
04:42:58,380 --> 04:42:59,120
before the elder

17303
04:42:59,120 --> 04:43:00,320
ones are married.

17304
04:43:00,660 --> 04:43:02,060
Your younger sisters

17305
04:43:02,060 --> 04:43:03,560
must be very young.

17306
04:43:04,500 --> 04:43:05,260
Yes.

17307
04:43:05,260 --> 04:43:07,140
My youngest is not 16.

17308
04:43:07,740 --> 04:43:09,020
Perhaps she is for young

17309
04:43:09,020 --> 04:43:10,220
to be much in company.

17310
04:43:10,640 --> 04:43:11,480
But really, Mom,

17311
04:43:11,480 --> 04:43:11,900
I think it would

17312
04:43:11,900 --> 04:43:12,580
be very hard

17313
04:43:12,580 --> 04:43:13,700
upon younger sisters

17314
04:43:13,700 --> 04:43:13,980
that they

17315
04:43:13,980 --> 04:43:14,540
should not have

17316
04:43:14,540 --> 04:43:15,660
their share of society

17317
04:43:15,660 --> 04:43:16,460
in amusement

17318
04:43:16,460 --> 04:43:17,640
because the may not have

17319
04:43:17,640 --> 04:43:18,720
the means or inclination

17320
04:43:18,720 --> 04:43:19,920
to marry early.

17321
04:43:20,040 --> 04:43:20,960
The last born

17322
04:43:20,960 --> 04:43:21,580
has as good a

17323
04:43:21,580 --> 04:43:22,380
right to the pleasures

17324
04:43:22,380 --> 04:43:23,580
of youth at the first

17325
04:43:23,780 --> 04:43:24,860
and to be kept back

17326
04:43:24,860 --> 04:43:26,060
on such a motive.

17327
04:43:26,460 --> 04:43:27,180
I it would not

17328
04:43:27,180 --> 04:43:27,840
be very likely

17329
04:43:27,840 --> 04:43:28,220
to promote

17330
04:43:28,220 --> 04:43:29,180
sisterly affection

17331
04:43:29,180 --> 04:43:30,500
or delicacy of mind

17332
04:43:31,380 --> 04:43:33,440
upon my word.

17333
04:43:33,860 --> 04:43:35,060
Said Her Ladyship.

17334
04:43:35,300 --> 04:43:36,760
You give your opinion

17335
04:43:37,100 --> 04:43:38,220
decidedly for

17336
04:43:38,220 --> 04:43:39,420
so young a person.

17337
04:43:39,960 --> 04:43:40,420
Pray.

17338
04:43:40,420 --> 04:43:41,640
What is your age

17339
04:43:42,440 --> 04:43:43,560
with three younger

17340
04:43:43,560 --> 04:43:44,760
sisters grown up?

17341
04:43:44,920 --> 04:43:45,860
Replied Elizabeth,

17342
04:43:45,860 --> 04:43:46,980
smiling.

17343
04:43:46,980 --> 04:43:48,020
Ladyship can hardly

17344
04:43:48,020 --> 04:43:49,320
expect me to own it.

17345
04:43:50,160 --> 04:43:50,920
Lady Catherine

17346
04:43:50,920 --> 04:43:52,220
seemed quite astonished

17347
04:43:52,220 --> 04:43:52,900
at not receiving

17348
04:43:52,900 --> 04:43:54,000
a direct answer.

17349
04:43:54,000 --> 04:43:55,100
And Elizabeth suspected

17350
04:43:55,100 --> 04:43:55,420
herself

17351
04:43:55,420 --> 04:43:56,420
to be the first creature

17352
04:43:56,420 --> 04:43:56,900
who had ever

17353
04:43:56,900 --> 04:43:57,760
dare to trifle

17354
04:43:57,760 --> 04:43:58,340
with so much

17355
04:43:58,340 --> 04:43:59,600
dignified impertinence.

17356
04:44:00,480 --> 04:44:01,600
You cannot be

17357
04:44:01,600 --> 04:44:02,900
more than 20.

17358
04:44:02,920 --> 04:44:04,140
I am sure.

17359
04:44:04,140 --> 04:44:04,880
Therefore, you need

17360
04:44:04,880 --> 04:44:06,400
not conceal your age.

17361
04:44:07,160 --> 04:44:08,660
I am not one in 20.

17362
04:44:09,720 --> 04:44:10,420
When the gentleman.

17363
04:44:10,420 --> 04:44:11,160
Had joined them

17364
04:44:11,160 --> 04:44:12,360
and tea was over.

17365
04:44:12,360 --> 04:44:12,840
The card

17366
04:44:12,840 --> 04:44:14,040
tables were placed.

17367
04:44:14,120 --> 04:44:15,140
Lady Catherine, Sir

17368
04:44:15,140 --> 04:44:15,980
William and Mr..

17369
04:44:15,980 --> 04:44:16,340
And Mrs.

17370
04:44:16,340 --> 04:44:16,740
Collins

17371
04:44:16,740 --> 04:44:17,940
sat down to quadrille,

17372
04:44:18,180 --> 04:44:18,760
and as Mr.

17373
04:44:18,760 --> 04:44:19,400
Burke chose

17374
04:44:19,400 --> 04:44:20,600
to play it Casino.

17375
04:44:20,600 --> 04:44:20,960
The two

17376
04:44:20,960 --> 04:44:21,920
girls had the honor

17377
04:44:21,920 --> 04:44:22,680
of assisting Mrs.

17378
04:44:22,680 --> 04:44:23,220
Jenkinson

17379
04:44:23,220 --> 04:44:24,420
to make up her party.

17380
04:44:24,680 --> 04:44:26,920
Their table was stupid.

17381
04:44:27,300 --> 04:44:27,900
Scarcely

17382
04:44:27,900 --> 04:44:28,900
a syllable was uttered

17383
04:44:28,900 --> 04:44:29,420
that did not

17384
04:44:29,420 --> 04:44:30,540
relate to the game,

17385
04:44:30,540 --> 04:44:31,380
except when Mrs.

17386
04:44:31,380 --> 04:44:32,340
Jenkinson expressed

17387
04:44:32,340 --> 04:44:33,200
her fears of Mr.

17388
04:44:33,200 --> 04:44:34,020
Burke's being too

17389
04:44:34,020 --> 04:44:35,220
hot or too cold.

17390
04:44:35,360 --> 04:44:36,480
Or having too much

17391
04:44:36,480 --> 04:44:37,680
or too little light.

17392
04:44:38,040 --> 04:44:38,740
A great deal

17393
04:44:38,740 --> 04:44:39,400
more passed

17394
04:44:39,400 --> 04:44:40,620
at the other table.

17395
04:44:40,640 --> 04:44:41,600
Lady Catherine was,

17396
04:44:41,600 --> 04:44:42,800
generally speaking,

17397
04:44:42,840 --> 04:44:43,940
stating the mistakes

17398
04:44:43,940 --> 04:44:44,880
of the three others

17399
04:44:44,880 --> 04:44:45,500
or relating

17400
04:44:45,500 --> 04:44:46,340
some anecdote

17401
04:44:46,340 --> 04:44:47,520
of herself.

17402
04:44:47,520 --> 04:44:47,880
Mr.

17403
04:44:47,880 --> 04:44:48,860
Collins was employed

17404
04:44:48,860 --> 04:44:49,420
in agreeing

17405
04:44:49,420 --> 04:44:49,940
to everything

17406
04:44:49,940 --> 04:44:51,080
Her Ladyship said,

17407
04:44:51,080 --> 04:44:51,760
thanking her

17408
04:44:51,760 --> 04:44:52,980
for every fish he won

17409
04:44:53,120 --> 04:44:54,100
and apologizing

17410
04:44:54,100 --> 04:44:54,560
if he thought

17411
04:44:54,560 --> 04:44:55,760
he won too many.

17412
04:44:55,980 --> 04:44:56,600
Sir William

17413
04:44:56,600 --> 04:44:57,800
did not say much.

17414
04:44:57,860 --> 04:44:58,860
He was storing his

17415
04:44:58,860 --> 04:45:00,180
memory with anecdotes

17416
04:45:00,180 --> 04:45:01,320
and noble names.

17417
04:45:02,340 --> 04:45:02,780
When Lady

17418
04:45:02,780 --> 04:45:03,400
Catherine and her

17419
04:45:03,400 --> 04:45:04,200
daughter had played

17420
04:45:04,200 --> 04:45:05,400
as long as they chose,

17421
04:45:05,420 --> 04:45:06,060
the tables

17422
04:45:06,060 --> 04:45:06,920
were broken up.

17423
04:45:06,920 --> 04:45:07,940
The carriage was offered

17424
04:45:07,940 --> 04:45:08,340
to Mrs.

17425
04:45:08,340 --> 04:45:09,020
Collins,

17426
04:45:09,020 --> 04:45:10,160
gratefully accepted

17427
04:45:10,160 --> 04:45:11,360
and immediately ordered.

17428
04:45:11,720 --> 04:45:12,840
The party then gathered

17429
04:45:12,840 --> 04:45:13,460
round the fire

17430
04:45:13,460 --> 04:45:14,820
to hear Lady determine

17431
04:45:14,860 --> 04:45:15,640
whether they would

17432
04:45:15,640 --> 04:45:16,840
have on the morrow.

17433
04:45:16,980 --> 04:45:17,960
From these instructions,

17434
04:45:17,960 --> 04:45:18,540
they were summoned

17435
04:45:18,540 --> 04:45:19,160
by the arrival

17436
04:45:19,160 --> 04:45:20,000
of the coach.

17437
04:45:20,000 --> 04:45:20,580
And with many

17438
04:45:20,580 --> 04:45:21,000
speeches of.

17439
04:45:21,000 --> 04:45:21,860
Thankfulness on Mr.

17440
04:45:21,860 --> 04:45:22,740
Collins side

17441
04:45:22,740 --> 04:45:23,740
and as many boughs on

17442
04:45:23,740 --> 04:45:24,560
Sir William's,

17443
04:45:24,560 --> 04:45:25,760
they departed.

17444
04:45:25,860 --> 04:45:26,480
As soon as they had

17445
04:45:26,480 --> 04:45:27,560
driven. From the door.

17446
04:45:27,560 --> 04:45:28,640
Elizabeth was called on

17447
04:45:28,640 --> 04:45:29,260
by her cousin

17448
04:45:29,260 --> 04:45:30,080
to give her opinion

17449
04:45:30,080 --> 04:45:30,500
of all that

17450
04:45:30,500 --> 04:45:30,760
she had

17451
04:45:30,760 --> 04:45:31,980
seen at Rose things

17452
04:45:32,080 --> 04:45:32,600
which, for

17453
04:45:32,600 --> 04:45:33,560
Charlotte's sake,

17454
04:45:33,560 --> 04:45:34,800
she more favorable

17455
04:45:34,800 --> 04:45:36,000
than it really was.

17456
04:45:36,140 --> 04:45:36,500
But her

17457
04:45:36,500 --> 04:45:37,580
commendation, though

17458
04:45:37,580 --> 04:45:38,080
costing her

17459
04:45:38,080 --> 04:45:38,840
some trouble.

17460
04:45:38,840 --> 04:45:39,800
Could by no means.

17461
04:45:39,800 --> 04:45:40,600
Satisfy Mr.

17462
04:45:40,600 --> 04:45:41,340
Collins.

17463
04:45:41,340 --> 04:45:42,360
And he was very soon

17464
04:45:42,360 --> 04:45:42,860
obliged

17465
04:45:42,860 --> 04:45:43,280
to take her

17466
04:45:43,280 --> 04:45:44,360
ladyship praise

17467
04:45:44,360 --> 04:45:45,720
into his own hands.

17468
04:45:47,480 --> 04:45:48,680
Chapter 30

17469
04:45:49,500 --> 04:45:50,400
Sir William stayed

17470
04:45:50,400 --> 04:45:50,960
only a week

17471
04:45:50,960 --> 04:45:51,800
at Hunt's effort,

17472
04:45:51,800 --> 04:45:52,420
but his visit

17473
04:45:52,420 --> 04:45:53,040
was long enough

17474
04:45:53,040 --> 04:45:53,640
to convince

17475
04:45:53,640 --> 04:45:54,300
of his daughters

17476
04:45:54,300 --> 04:45:54,760
being most

17477
04:45:54,760 --> 04:45:55,880
comfortably settled.

17478
04:45:55,880 --> 04:45:56,880
And after possessing

17479
04:45:56,880 --> 04:45:57,680
such a husband

17480
04:45:57,680 --> 04:45:58,740
and such a neighbor

17481
04:45:58,740 --> 04:45:59,340
as were not.

17482
04:45:59,340 --> 04:46:00,540
Often met with.

17483
04:46:00,660 --> 04:46:01,100
While Sir

17484
04:46:01,100 --> 04:46:02,180
William was with them.

17485
04:46:02,180 --> 04:46:02,520
Mr.

17486
04:46:02,520 --> 04:46:02,920
Collins,

17487
04:46:02,920 --> 04:46:03,800
devoted his morning

17488
04:46:03,800 --> 04:46:04,560
to driving him out

17489
04:46:04,560 --> 04:46:05,240
at his gig

17490
04:46:05,240 --> 04:46:05,900
and showing him

17491
04:46:05,900 --> 04:46:06,800
the country.

17492
04:46:06,800 --> 04:46:08,000
But when he went away.

17493
04:46:08,000 --> 04:46:08,360
The whole

17494
04:46:08,360 --> 04:46:09,180
family returned

17495
04:46:09,180 --> 04:46:09,400
to their

17496
04:46:09,400 --> 04:46:10,620
usual employments,

17497
04:46:10,640 --> 04:46:11,300
and Elizabeth

17498
04:46:11,300 --> 04:46:11,820
was thankful

17499
04:46:11,820 --> 04:46:12,320
to find that

17500
04:46:12,320 --> 04:46:13,280
they did not see more

17501
04:46:13,280 --> 04:46:13,740
her cousin

17502
04:46:13,740 --> 04:46:14,920
by the alteration.

17503
04:46:14,920 --> 04:46:15,480
For the chief

17504
04:46:15,480 --> 04:46:15,920
of the time

17505
04:46:15,920 --> 04:46:16,700
between breakfast

17506
04:46:16,700 --> 04:46:17,120
and dinner

17507
04:46:17,120 --> 04:46:18,320
was now passed by him

17508
04:46:18,500 --> 04:46:18,860
either

17509
04:46:18,860 --> 04:46:19,980
at work in the garden

17510
04:46:19,980 --> 04:46:20,700
or in reading

17511
04:46:20,700 --> 04:46:21,500
and writing

17512
04:46:21,500 --> 04:46:22,080
and looking out

17513
04:46:22,080 --> 04:46:22,640
of the window

17514
04:46:22,640 --> 04:46:23,720
in his own book room,

17515
04:46:23,720 --> 04:46:24,920
which fronted the road.

17516
04:46:25,420 --> 04:46:26,060
The room in which.

17517
04:46:26,060 --> 04:46:26,520
The lady

17518
04:46:26,520 --> 04:46:27,720
sat was backwards.

17519
04:46:28,040 --> 04:46:29,160
Elizabeth had at first

17520
04:46:29,160 --> 04:46:29,880
rather wondered that

17521
04:46:29,880 --> 04:46:30,240
Charlotte

17522
04:46:30,240 --> 04:46:30,860
should not prefer

17523
04:46:30,860 --> 04:46:31,640
the dining parlor

17524
04:46:31,640 --> 04:46:32,740
for common use.

17525
04:46:32,740 --> 04:46:34,160
It a better sized room

17526
04:46:34,340 --> 04:46:34,860
and had a more

17527
04:46:34,860 --> 04:46:36,060
pleasant aspect.

17528
04:46:36,260 --> 04:46:37,040
But she soon.

17529
04:46:37,040 --> 04:46:38,000
Saw that her friend

17530
04:46:38,000 --> 04:46:39,140
had an excellent reason

17531
04:46:39,140 --> 04:46:40,280
for what she did.

17532
04:46:40,280 --> 04:46:40,760
For Mr.

17533
04:46:40,760 --> 04:46:41,220
Collins

17534
04:46:41,220 --> 04:46:42,000
would undoubtedly

17535
04:46:42,000 --> 04:46:42,900
have been much less

17536
04:46:42,900 --> 04:46:43,940
his own apartment

17537
04:46:43,940 --> 04:46:45,000
had they sat in one.

17538
04:46:45,000 --> 04:46:46,200
Equally lively.

17539
04:46:46,340 --> 04:46:47,000
And she gave

17540
04:46:47,000 --> 04:46:47,880
Charlotte credit

17541
04:46:47,880 --> 04:46:49,080
for the arrangement.

17542
04:46:49,500 --> 04:46:50,340
From the drawing room,

17543
04:46:50,340 --> 04:46:51,080
they could distinguish

17544
04:46:51,080 --> 04:46:52,140
nothing in the lane

17545
04:46:52,140 --> 04:46:53,300
and were indebted Mr.

17546
04:46:53,300 --> 04:46:53,740
Collins

17547
04:46:53,740 --> 04:46:54,360
for the knowledge

17548
04:46:54,360 --> 04:46:55,140
of what carriages

17549
04:46:55,140 --> 04:46:55,860
went along

17550
04:46:55,860 --> 04:46:56,600
at how often,

17551
04:46:56,600 --> 04:46:57,500
especially Mr.

17552
04:46:57,500 --> 04:46:57,800
Burke

17553
04:46:57,800 --> 04:46:59,000
drove by in her phaeton,

17554
04:46:59,120 --> 04:47:00,080
which he never failed

17555
04:47:00,080 --> 04:47:00,480
coming to

17556
04:47:00,480 --> 04:47:01,320
inform them of,

17557
04:47:01,320 --> 04:47:02,040
though it happened

17558
04:47:02,040 --> 04:47:03,240
almost every day.

17559
04:47:03,360 --> 04:47:03,980
She not on,

17560
04:47:03,980 --> 04:47:04,760
frequently stopped

17561
04:47:04,760 --> 04:47:05,580
at the parsonage

17562
04:47:05,580 --> 04:47:06,400
and had a few minutes

17563
04:47:06,400 --> 04:47:06,980
conversation

17564
04:47:06,980 --> 04:47:07,800
with Charlotte.

17565
04:47:07,800 --> 04:47:08,080
But was.

17566
04:47:08,080 --> 04:47:08,820
Scarcely ever

17567
04:47:08,820 --> 04:47:09,500
prevailed upon

17568
04:47:09,500 --> 04:47:10,700
to get out.

17569
04:47:10,760 --> 04:47:11,780
Very few days

17570
04:47:11,780 --> 04:47:12,900
passed in, which Mr.

17571
04:47:12,900 --> 04:47:13,460
Collins did

17572
04:47:13,460 --> 04:47:14,660
not walk to Rose Kings

17573
04:47:14,820 --> 04:47:15,900
and not many in which

17574
04:47:15,900 --> 04:47:16,380
his wife did

17575
04:47:16,380 --> 04:47:17,420
not think it necessary

17576
04:47:17,420 --> 04:47:19,200
to go likewise and tell.

17577
04:47:19,200 --> 04:47:20,220
Elizabeth recollected

17578
04:47:20,220 --> 04:47:20,700
that there might

17579
04:47:20,700 --> 04:47:21,400
be other family

17580
04:47:21,400 --> 04:47:21,860
livings to.

17581
04:47:21,860 --> 04:47:22,900
Be disposed of.

17582
04:47:22,900 --> 04:47:23,400
She could not

17583
04:47:23,400 --> 04:47:23,900
understand.

17584
04:47:23,900 --> 04:47:24,680
The sacrifice

17585
04:47:24,680 --> 04:47:26,480
of so many hours now

17586
04:47:26,480 --> 04:47:26,920
and then

17587
04:47:26,920 --> 04:47:27,540
they were honored

17588
04:47:27,540 --> 04:47:27,960
with a call

17589
04:47:27,960 --> 04:47:28,980
from Her Ladyship

17590
04:47:28,980 --> 04:47:29,840
and nothing escaped

17591
04:47:29,840 --> 04:47:30,560
her observation

17592
04:47:30,560 --> 04:47:31,200
that was passing

17593
04:47:31,200 --> 04:47:31,640
in the room

17594
04:47:31,640 --> 04:47:32,840
during these visits,

17595
04:47:32,960 --> 04:47:33,800
she examined into

17596
04:47:33,800 --> 04:47:34,700
their employments,

17597
04:47:34,700 --> 04:47:35,720
looked at their work

17598
04:47:35,720 --> 04:47:36,380
and advised

17599
04:47:36,380 --> 04:47:36,960
them to do it

17600
04:47:36,960 --> 04:47:37,760
differently.

17601
04:47:37,760 --> 04:47:38,480
Found fault

17602
04:47:38,480 --> 04:47:39,200
with the arrangement

17603
04:47:39,200 --> 04:47:40,040
of the furniture

17604
04:47:40,040 --> 04:47:40,740
or detected

17605
04:47:40,740 --> 04:47:41,400
the housemaid

17606
04:47:41,400 --> 04:47:42,320
in negligence

17607
04:47:42,320 --> 04:47:43,240
and she accepted

17608
04:47:43,240 --> 04:47:44,160
any refreshment

17609
04:47:44,160 --> 04:47:44,960
seemed to do it

17610
04:47:44,960 --> 04:47:45,800
only for the sake of

17611
04:47:45,800 --> 04:47:46,820
finding out that Mrs.

17612
04:47:46,820 --> 04:47:48,000
Collins's joints of meat

17613
04:47:48,000 --> 04:47:48,800
were too large

17614
04:47:48,800 --> 04:47:50,000
for her family.

17615
04:47:50,420 --> 04:47:51,300
Elizabeth soon

17616
04:47:51,300 --> 04:47:52,080
perceived.

17617
04:47:52,080 --> 04:47:52,520
That.

17618
04:47:52,520 --> 04:47:53,460
This great lady was.

17619
04:47:53,460 --> 04:47:54,180
Not in condition.

17620
04:47:54,180 --> 04:47:54,360
Of the

17621
04:47:54,360 --> 04:47:55,560
peace of the county.

17622
04:47:55,560 --> 04:47:56,640
She was the most active

17623
04:47:56,640 --> 04:47:57,300
magistrate

17624
04:47:57,300 --> 04:47:58,460
in her own parish.

17625
04:47:58,460 --> 04:47:59,740
The minutest concerns

17626
04:47:59,740 --> 04:48:00,580
of which were carried

17627
04:48:00,580 --> 04:48:01,220
to her by Mr.

17628
04:48:01,220 --> 04:48:02,040
Collins.

17629
04:48:02,040 --> 04:48:02,540
And whenever

17630
04:48:02,540 --> 04:48:03,400
any of the cottagers

17631
04:48:03,400 --> 04:48:03,900
were disposed

17632
04:48:03,900 --> 04:48:04,080
to be

17633
04:48:04,080 --> 04:48:04,740
quarrelsome,

17634
04:48:04,740 --> 04:48:05,480
discontented

17635
04:48:05,480 --> 04:48:06,680
or too poor,

17636
04:48:06,800 --> 04:48:07,800
she slid forth

17637
04:48:07,800 --> 04:48:08,340
into the village

17638
04:48:08,340 --> 04:48:08,720
to settle

17639
04:48:08,720 --> 04:48:09,560
their differences,

17640
04:48:09,560 --> 04:48:10,760
silence their complaints

17641
04:48:10,860 --> 04:48:11,480
and scold

17642
04:48:11,480 --> 04:48:12,300
them into harmony

17643
04:48:12,300 --> 04:48:13,500
and plenty.

17644
04:48:13,900 --> 04:48:14,720
The entertainment

17645
04:48:14,720 --> 04:48:15,720
of dining at rose rings

17646
04:48:15,720 --> 04:48:16,760
is repeated about twice

17647
04:48:16,760 --> 04:48:17,360
a week

17648
04:48:17,360 --> 04:48:17,920
and allowing

17649
04:48:17,920 --> 04:48:18,440
for the loss

17650
04:48:18,440 --> 04:48:19,680
of Sir William and there

17651
04:48:19,680 --> 04:48:20,160
being only

17652
04:48:20,160 --> 04:48:21,360
one card table in the.

17653
04:48:21,800 --> 04:48:23,040
Every such entertainment

17654
04:48:23,040 --> 04:48:23,780
was the counterpart

17655
04:48:23,780 --> 04:48:24,800
of the first.

17656
04:48:24,800 --> 04:48:25,800
Their other engagements

17657
04:48:25,800 --> 04:48:26,520
were few

17658
04:48:26,520 --> 04:48:27,180
as the style

17659
04:48:27,180 --> 04:48:27,540
of living

17660
04:48:27,540 --> 04:48:28,080
in the neighborhood

17661
04:48:28,080 --> 04:48:28,580
in general

17662
04:48:28,580 --> 04:48:29,300
was beyond Mr.

17663
04:48:29,300 --> 04:48:30,500
Collins reach.

17664
04:48:30,680 --> 04:48:31,380
This, however,

17665
04:48:31,380 --> 04:48:32,000
was no evil

17666
04:48:32,000 --> 04:48:32,900
to Elizabeth,

17667
04:48:32,900 --> 04:48:33,740
and upon the whole

17668
04:48:33,740 --> 04:48:34,560
she spent her time

17669
04:48:34,560 --> 04:48:35,740
comfortably enough.

17670
04:48:35,740 --> 04:48:36,740
There were half hours

17671
04:48:36,740 --> 04:48:37,760
of pleasant conversation

17672
04:48:37,760 --> 04:48:38,660
with Charlotte,

17673
04:48:38,660 --> 04:48:39,200
and the weather

17674
04:48:39,200 --> 04:48:39,920
was so fine

17675
04:48:39,920 --> 04:48:40,940
for the time year

17676
04:48:40,940 --> 04:48:41,740
that she had often

17677
04:48:41,740 --> 04:48:42,500
great enjoyment

17678
04:48:42,500 --> 04:48:43,580
out of doors,

17679
04:48:43,580 --> 04:48:44,700
her favorite walk,

17680
04:48:44,700 --> 04:48:45,080
and where

17681
04:48:45,080 --> 04:48:46,020
she frequently went

17682
04:48:46,020 --> 04:48:46,560
while the others

17683
04:48:46,560 --> 04:48:47,040
were calling on

17684
04:48:47,040 --> 04:48:48,540
Lady Catherine was along

17685
04:48:48,540 --> 04:48:49,340
the open grove,

17686
04:48:49,340 --> 04:48:49,860
which edged

17687
04:48:49,860 --> 04:48:51,060
that of the park

17688
04:48:51,060 --> 04:48:51,920
where there was a nice,

17689
04:48:51,920 --> 04:48:53,060
sheltered path

17690
04:48:53,060 --> 04:48:53,700
which no one

17691
04:48:53,700 --> 04:48:54,360
seemed to value

17692
04:48:54,360 --> 04:48:55,240
but herself,

17693
04:48:55,240 --> 04:48:55,640
and where

17694
04:48:55,640 --> 04:48:56,060
she felt

17695
04:48:56,060 --> 04:48:57,260
beyond the reach of Lady

17696
04:48:57,260 --> 04:48:58,560
Catherine's curiosity.

17697
04:48:59,040 --> 04:49:00,300
In this quiet way.

17698
04:49:00,300 --> 04:49:00,800
The first

17699
04:49:00,800 --> 04:49:01,800
fortnight of her visit

17700
04:49:01,800 --> 04:49:03,000
soon passed away.

17701
04:49:03,240 --> 04:49:04,440
Easter was approaching

17702
04:49:04,580 --> 04:49:05,600
and the week preceding

17703
04:49:05,600 --> 04:49:06,240
it was to bring

17704
04:49:06,240 --> 04:49:06,720
an addition

17705
04:49:06,720 --> 04:49:07,340
to the family

17706
04:49:07,340 --> 04:49:08,300
at Rose Ings.

17707
04:49:08,300 --> 04:49:09,060
Which in so.

17708
04:49:09,060 --> 04:49:09,840
Small a circle

17709
04:49:09,840 --> 04:49:11,040
must be important.

17710
04:49:11,360 --> 04:49:12,620
Elizabeth had heard soon

17711
04:49:12,620 --> 04:49:13,460
after her arrival

17712
04:49:13,460 --> 04:49:13,860
that Mr.

17713
04:49:13,860 --> 04:49:15,020
Darcy was expected there

17714
04:49:15,020 --> 04:49:15,500
in the course

17715
04:49:15,500 --> 04:49:16,640
of a few weeks,

17716
04:49:16,640 --> 04:49:17,000
and though

17717
04:49:17,000 --> 04:49:17,480
there were not

17718
04:49:17,480 --> 04:49:17,740
many of

17719
04:49:17,740 --> 04:49:18,560
her acquaintances

17720
04:49:18,560 --> 04:49:19,760
whom she did not prefer,

17721
04:49:19,940 --> 04:49:20,460
his coming

17722
04:49:20,460 --> 04:49:21,140
would furnish one

17723
04:49:21,140 --> 04:49:21,980
comparatively new

17724
04:49:21,980 --> 04:49:22,580
to look at

17725
04:49:22,580 --> 04:49:23,780
in their roses parties.

17726
04:49:24,020 --> 04:49:24,480
And she might

17727
04:49:24,480 --> 04:49:25,140
be amused in.

17728
04:49:25,140 --> 04:49:26,300
Seeing how hopeless Ms..

17729
04:49:26,300 --> 04:49:27,440
Bayley's designs on him

17730
04:49:27,440 --> 04:49:28,740
were by his behavior

17731
04:49:28,740 --> 04:49:29,960
to his cousin for whom

17732
04:49:29,960 --> 04:49:30,200
he was

17733
04:49:30,200 --> 04:49:31,200
evidently destined

17734
04:49:31,200 --> 04:49:32,360
by Lady Catherine.

17735
04:49:32,360 --> 04:49:33,080
Who talked of his.

17736
04:49:33,080 --> 04:49:33,380
Coming

17737
04:49:33,380 --> 04:49:33,580
with the

17738
04:49:33,580 --> 04:49:34,860
greatest satisfaction,

17739
04:49:35,120 --> 04:49:36,140
spoke of him in terms

17740
04:49:36,140 --> 04:49:36,320
of the

17741
04:49:36,320 --> 04:49:37,520
highest admiration,

17742
04:49:37,680 --> 04:49:38,880
and seemed almost angry,

17743
04:49:38,960 --> 04:49:39,320
find that

17744
04:49:39,320 --> 04:49:39,900
he had already

17745
04:49:39,900 --> 04:49:40,520
been frequently

17746
04:49:40,520 --> 04:49:41,180
seen by Ms..

17747
04:49:41,180 --> 04:49:42,380
Lucas and herself.

17748
04:49:43,160 --> 04:49:43,760
His arrival

17749
04:49:43,760 --> 04:49:44,120
was soon

17750
04:49:44,120 --> 04:49:45,320
known at the parsonage

17751
04:49:45,440 --> 04:49:45,900
for Mr.

17752
04:49:45,900 --> 04:49:46,760
Collins was walking

17753
04:49:46,760 --> 04:49:47,400
the whole morning

17754
04:49:47,400 --> 04:49:47,840
within view

17755
04:49:47,840 --> 04:49:48,480
of the lodge's

17756
04:49:48,480 --> 04:49:49,200
opening into Hunt's

17757
04:49:49,200 --> 04:49:50,000
four lane.

17758
04:49:50,000 --> 04:49:50,600
In order to have.

17759
04:49:50,600 --> 04:49:51,100
The earliest

17760
04:49:51,100 --> 04:49:52,140
assurance of it.

17761
04:49:52,140 --> 04:49:53,340
And after making his bow

17762
04:49:53,340 --> 04:49:53,900
as the carriage

17763
04:49:53,900 --> 04:49:54,960
turned into the park,

17764
04:49:54,960 --> 04:49:55,640
hurried home

17765
04:49:55,640 --> 04:49:55,820
with the

17766
04:49:55,820 --> 04:49:57,020
great intelligence.

17767
04:49:57,180 --> 04:49:57,440
On the

17768
04:49:57,440 --> 04:49:58,160
following morning,

17769
04:49:58,160 --> 04:49:59,080
he hastened to Rose's

17770
04:49:59,080 --> 04:50:00,300
to pay his respects.

17771
04:50:00,400 --> 04:50:01,460
There were two nephews

17772
04:50:01,460 --> 04:50:02,160
of Lady Catherine

17773
04:50:02,160 --> 04:50:03,560
to require them for Mr.

17774
04:50:03,560 --> 04:50:04,080
Darcy had

17775
04:50:04,080 --> 04:50:04,700
brought with him

17776
04:50:04,700 --> 04:50:05,900
a Colonel Fitzwilliam,

17777
04:50:06,020 --> 04:50:06,500
the younger

17778
04:50:06,500 --> 04:50:07,460
son of his uncle,

17779
04:50:07,460 --> 04:50:08,520
Lord Blanc,

17780
04:50:08,520 --> 04:50:08,880
and to the

17781
04:50:08,880 --> 04:50:09,580
great surprise

17782
04:50:09,580 --> 04:50:10,520
of all the party.

17783
04:50:10,520 --> 04:50:10,940
When Mr.

17784
04:50:10,940 --> 04:50:12,060
Collins returned.

17785
04:50:12,060 --> 04:50:12,620
The gentleman

17786
04:50:12,620 --> 04:50:13,140
accompanied.

17787
04:50:13,140 --> 04:50:13,860
Him.

17788
04:50:13,860 --> 04:50:14,880
Charlotte had seen them

17789
04:50:14,880 --> 04:50:16,020
from her husband's room,

17790
04:50:16,020 --> 04:50:17,060
crossing the road

17791
04:50:17,060 --> 04:50:17,720
and immediately

17792
04:50:17,720 --> 04:50:18,840
running into the other,

17793
04:50:18,840 --> 04:50:19,560
told the girls

17794
04:50:19,560 --> 04:50:20,120
what an honor

17795
04:50:20,120 --> 04:50:20,420
they might

17796
04:50:20,420 --> 04:50:21,620
expect, adding.

17797
04:50:22,040 --> 04:50:23,260
I may thank you, Eliza.

17798
04:50:23,260 --> 04:50:23,880
For this peace of.

17799
04:50:23,880 --> 04:50:24,980
Civility. Mr.

17800
04:50:24,980 --> 04:50:25,860
Darcy would never have

17801
04:50:25,860 --> 04:50:26,260
come so

17802
04:50:26,260 --> 04:50:27,500
soon to wait upon me.

17803
04:50:28,460 --> 04:50:29,080
Had scarcely

17804
04:50:29,080 --> 04:50:29,900
time to disclaim

17805
04:50:29,900 --> 04:50:30,440
all rights

17806
04:50:30,440 --> 04:50:31,340
to the compliment.

17807
04:50:31,340 --> 04:50:32,300
Before their approach

17808
04:50:32,300 --> 04:50:32,880
was announced

17809
04:50:32,880 --> 04:50:33,840
by the doorbell.

17810
04:50:33,840 --> 04:50:34,980
And shortly afterwards,

17811
04:50:34,980 --> 04:50:35,700
the three gentlemen

17812
04:50:35,700 --> 04:50:36,760
entered the room.

17813
04:50:36,760 --> 04:50:37,880
Colonel Fitzwilliam

17814
04:50:37,880 --> 04:50:38,640
led the way.

17815
04:50:38,640 --> 04:50:39,760
Was about 30.

17816
04:50:39,760 --> 04:50:40,980
Not handsome, but.

17817
04:50:40,980 --> 04:50:41,520
In person,

17818
04:50:41,520 --> 04:50:42,080
and addressed

17819
04:50:42,080 --> 04:50:42,900
most truly

17820
04:50:42,900 --> 04:50:43,980
the gentleman.

17821
04:50:43,980 --> 04:50:44,300
Mr.

17822
04:50:44,300 --> 04:50:44,920
Darcy looked

17823
04:50:44,920 --> 04:50:45,500
just as he had

17824
04:50:45,500 --> 04:50:45,900
been used

17825
04:50:45,900 --> 04:50:46,200
to look

17826
04:50:46,200 --> 04:50:47,240
in Hertfordshire,

17827
04:50:47,240 --> 04:50:48,320
paid his compliments

17828
04:50:48,320 --> 04:50:48,860
with his usual

17829
04:50:48,860 --> 04:50:49,600
reserved Mrs.

17830
04:50:49,600 --> 04:50:50,480
Collins. And.

17831
04:50:50,480 --> 04:50:51,180
Whatever might be

17832
04:50:51,180 --> 04:50:51,720
his feelings

17833
04:50:51,720 --> 04:50:52,760
toward her friend

17834
04:50:52,760 --> 04:50:53,240
met her

17835
04:50:53,240 --> 04:50:54,260
with every appearance

17836
04:50:54,260 --> 04:50:55,380
of composure.

17837
04:50:55,380 --> 04:50:56,240
Elizabeth merely

17838
04:50:56,240 --> 04:50:57,020
curtsy to him

17839
04:50:57,020 --> 04:50:58,320
without a word.

17840
04:50:59,340 --> 04:50:59,660
Colonel

17841
04:50:59,660 --> 04:51:00,440
Fitzwilliam entered

17842
04:51:00,440 --> 04:51:01,200
into conversation

17843
04:51:01,200 --> 04:51:01,700
directly

17844
04:51:01,700 --> 04:51:02,340
with the readiness

17845
04:51:02,340 --> 04:51:02,820
and ease

17846
04:51:02,820 --> 04:51:03,980
of a well-bred man

17847
04:51:03,980 --> 04:51:04,560
and talked

17848
04:51:04,560 --> 04:51:05,660
very pleasantly.

17849
04:51:05,660 --> 04:51:06,560
But his cousin,

17850
04:51:06,560 --> 04:51:07,500
after having addressed

17851
04:51:07,500 --> 04:51:08,520
a slight observation

17852
04:51:08,520 --> 04:51:09,000
on the house

17853
04:51:09,000 --> 04:51:09,860
and garden to Mrs.

17854
04:51:09,860 --> 04:51:10,640
Collins.

17855
04:51:10,640 --> 04:51:11,340
Sat for some.

17856
04:51:11,340 --> 04:51:12,240
Time without speaking.

17857
04:51:12,240 --> 04:51:13,320
To anybody.

17858
04:51:13,320 --> 04:51:14,260
At length, however,

17859
04:51:14,260 --> 04:51:15,140
his civility was so

17860
04:51:15,140 --> 04:51:15,900
far awakened

17861
04:51:15,900 --> 04:51:16,580
as to inquire

17862
04:51:16,580 --> 04:51:17,400
of Elizabeth,

17863
04:51:17,400 --> 04:51:17,720
the health

17864
04:51:17,720 --> 04:51:18,860
of her family.

17865
04:51:18,860 --> 04:51:19,560
She answered him

17866
04:51:19,560 --> 04:51:20,640
in the usual way

17867
04:51:20,640 --> 04:51:21,500
and after a moment's

17868
04:51:21,500 --> 04:51:22,700
pause, added.

17869
04:51:23,040 --> 04:51:23,780
My eldest

17870
04:51:23,780 --> 04:51:25,080
sister has been in town

17871
04:51:25,080 --> 04:51:26,260
these three months.

17872
04:51:26,260 --> 04:51:27,140
Have you never happened

17873
04:51:27,140 --> 04:51:27,580
to see her?

17874
04:51:27,580 --> 04:51:29,080
That she was

17875
04:51:29,080 --> 04:51:30,000
perfectly sensible,

17876
04:51:30,000 --> 04:51:31,080
that he never had.

17877
04:51:31,080 --> 04:51:31,740
But she wished to.

17878
04:51:31,740 --> 04:51:32,240
See whether he

17879
04:51:32,240 --> 04:51:32,720
would betray

17880
04:51:32,720 --> 04:51:33,540
any consciousness

17881
04:51:33,540 --> 04:51:34,220
of what had passed

17882
04:51:34,220 --> 04:51:34,580
between the

17883
04:51:34,580 --> 04:51:35,780
Bengalis and Jane?

17884
04:51:35,960 --> 04:51:36,540
And she thought

17885
04:51:36,540 --> 04:51:36,800
he looked

17886
04:51:36,800 --> 04:51:37,760
a little confused

17887
04:51:37,760 --> 04:51:38,840
as he answered that he.

17888
04:51:38,840 --> 04:51:39,380
Had never been

17889
04:51:39,380 --> 04:51:40,080
so fortunate

17890
04:51:40,080 --> 04:51:41,280
as to meet Miss Bennett.

17891
04:51:41,580 --> 04:51:42,680
The subject was pursued

17892
04:51:42,680 --> 04:51:43,580
no farther,

17893
04:51:43,580 --> 04:51:44,540
and the gentleman soon

17894
04:51:44,540 --> 04:51:45,740
afterwards went away.

17895
04:51:47,740 --> 04:51:48,960
Chapter 31

17896
04:51:50,000 --> 04:51:50,920
Colonel Fitzwilliams

17897
04:51:50,920 --> 04:51:51,360
Manners

17898
04:51:51,360 --> 04:51:52,340
were very much admired

17899
04:51:52,340 --> 04:51:53,420
at the parsonage,

17900
04:51:53,420 --> 04:51:54,760
and the ladies all felt

17901
04:51:54,760 --> 04:51:55,460
that he must add

17902
04:51:55,460 --> 04:51:56,080
considerably

17903
04:51:56,080 --> 04:51:56,700
to the pleasures

17904
04:51:56,700 --> 04:51:57,560
of their engagements

17905
04:51:57,560 --> 04:51:58,700
at Rose Ings.

17906
04:51:58,700 --> 04:51:59,260
It was some.

17907
04:51:59,260 --> 04:52:00,000
Days, however,

17908
04:52:00,000 --> 04:52:00,900
before they received

17909
04:52:00,900 --> 04:52:02,160
any invitation thither.

17910
04:52:02,520 --> 04:52:02,960
For while

17911
04:52:02,960 --> 04:52:03,680
there were visitors

17912
04:52:03,680 --> 04:52:04,420
in the house.

17913
04:52:04,420 --> 04:52:04,760
They could

17914
04:52:04,760 --> 04:52:05,960
not be necessary.

17915
04:52:06,060 --> 04:52:06,800
And it was not

17916
04:52:06,800 --> 04:52:07,860
till Easter day,

17917
04:52:07,860 --> 04:52:08,660
almost a week

17918
04:52:08,660 --> 04:52:08,960
after the

17919
04:52:08,960 --> 04:52:10,100
gentleman's arrival,

17920
04:52:10,100 --> 04:52:10,980
that they were honored

17921
04:52:10,980 --> 04:52:12,180
by such an attention.

17922
04:52:12,320 --> 04:52:13,100
And then they were

17923
04:52:13,100 --> 04:52:13,800
merely asked

17924
04:52:13,800 --> 04:52:14,540
on leaving church

17925
04:52:14,540 --> 04:52:15,060
to come there

17926
04:52:15,060 --> 04:52:16,220
in the evening.

17927
04:52:16,220 --> 04:52:17,160
For the last week,

17928
04:52:17,160 --> 04:52:17,580
they had seen

17929
04:52:17,580 --> 04:52:18,400
very little of Lady

17930
04:52:18,400 --> 04:52:18,840
Catherine

17931
04:52:18,840 --> 04:52:19,860
or her daughter.

17932
04:52:19,860 --> 04:52:20,720
Colonel Fitzwilliam

17933
04:52:20,720 --> 04:52:21,180
had called it

17934
04:52:21,180 --> 04:52:21,760
the parsonage

17935
04:52:21,760 --> 04:52:22,400
more than once

17936
04:52:22,400 --> 04:52:23,360
during the time.

17937
04:52:23,360 --> 04:52:23,820
But Mr.

17938
04:52:23,820 --> 04:52:24,240
Darcy,

17939
04:52:24,240 --> 04:52:24,720
they had only

17940
04:52:24,720 --> 04:52:25,920
seen a church.

17941
04:52:26,360 --> 04:52:27,020
The invitation

17942
04:52:27,020 --> 04:52:28,220
was accepted, of course,

17943
04:52:28,400 --> 04:52:29,580
and at a proper hour,

17944
04:52:29,580 --> 04:52:30,560
they joined the party

17945
04:52:30,560 --> 04:52:30,980
and Lady

17946
04:52:30,980 --> 04:52:31,500
Katherine's

17947
04:52:31,500 --> 04:52:32,600
drawing room.

17948
04:52:32,600 --> 04:52:33,260
Her ladyship

17949
04:52:33,260 --> 04:52:34,460
received them civilly,

17950
04:52:34,580 --> 04:52:35,460
but it was plain

17951
04:52:35,460 --> 04:52:36,260
that their company was

17952
04:52:36,260 --> 04:52:36,980
by no means

17953
04:52:36,980 --> 04:52:37,740
so acceptable

17954
04:52:37,740 --> 04:52:38,300
as when she could

17955
04:52:38,300 --> 04:52:39,500
get nobody else.

17956
04:52:39,620 --> 04:52:40,560
And she was in fact

17957
04:52:40,560 --> 04:52:41,600
almost engrossed

17958
04:52:41,600 --> 04:52:42,680
by her nephews

17959
04:52:42,680 --> 04:52:43,740
speaking to them,

17960
04:52:43,740 --> 04:52:44,940
especially to Darcy,

17961
04:52:45,140 --> 04:52:45,840
much more

17962
04:52:45,840 --> 04:52:46,800
than to any other person

17963
04:52:46,800 --> 04:52:48,000
in the room.

17964
04:52:48,020 --> 04:52:48,900
Colonel Fitzwilliam

17965
04:52:48,900 --> 04:52:49,640
seemed really glad

17966
04:52:49,640 --> 04:52:50,460
to see them.

17967
04:52:50,460 --> 04:52:51,440
Anything was a welcome

17968
04:52:51,440 --> 04:52:51,960
relief to him

17969
04:52:51,960 --> 04:52:53,240
that Rosing and Mrs.

17970
04:52:53,240 --> 04:52:53,700
Collins

17971
04:52:53,700 --> 04:52:54,560
pretty friend had.

17972
04:52:54,560 --> 04:52:55,800
Moreover, his fancy

17973
04:52:55,800 --> 04:52:56,780
very much.

17974
04:52:56,780 --> 04:52:57,920
He now seated himself

17975
04:52:57,920 --> 04:52:59,260
by her and talked

17976
04:52:59,260 --> 04:53:00,480
so agreeably of Kent

17977
04:53:00,480 --> 04:53:01,520
and Hertfordshire,

17978
04:53:01,520 --> 04:53:02,240
of traveling

17979
04:53:02,240 --> 04:53:03,440
and staying at home, of.

17980
04:53:03,440 --> 04:53:04,020
New books.

17981
04:53:04,020 --> 04:53:04,880
And music

17982
04:53:04,880 --> 04:53:05,920
that Elizabeth had never

17983
04:53:05,920 --> 04:53:06,680
been half so well

17984
04:53:06,680 --> 04:53:07,380
entertained in that

17985
04:53:07,380 --> 04:53:08,460
room before.

17986
04:53:08,460 --> 04:53:09,320
And they conversed with

17987
04:53:09,320 --> 04:53:10,600
so much spirit and flow

17988
04:53:10,760 --> 04:53:11,840
as to draw the attention

17989
04:53:11,840 --> 04:53:12,140
of Lady

17990
04:53:12,140 --> 04:53:13,160
Catherine herself,

17991
04:53:13,160 --> 04:53:14,080
as well as of Mr.

17992
04:53:14,080 --> 04:53:15,080
Darcy.

17993
04:53:15,080 --> 04:53:16,600
His eyes had been soon

17994
04:53:16,600 --> 04:53:17,600
and repeatedly charged

17995
04:53:17,600 --> 04:53:18,200
towards them

17996
04:53:18,200 --> 04:53:18,540
with a look

17997
04:53:18,540 --> 04:53:19,740
of curiosity,

17998
04:53:19,860 --> 04:53:20,960
and that her ladyship,

17999
04:53:20,960 --> 04:53:22,040
after a while shared

18000
04:53:22,040 --> 04:53:22,860
the feeling was more

18001
04:53:22,860 --> 04:53:24,060
openly acknowledged.

18002
04:53:24,060 --> 04:53:24,680
For she did not.

18003
04:53:24,680 --> 04:53:25,880
Scruple to call out.

18004
04:53:26,420 --> 04:53:27,200
What is it

18005
04:53:27,200 --> 04:53:27,580
that you were

18006
04:53:27,580 --> 04:53:28,860
saying, Fitzwilliam?

18007
04:53:29,060 --> 04:53:29,700
What is it

18008
04:53:29,700 --> 04:53:30,900
you are talking of?

18009
04:53:30,920 --> 04:53:31,940
What are you telling

18010
04:53:31,940 --> 04:53:32,520
Miss Bennett?

18011
04:53:32,520 --> 04:53:34,160
Let me hear what it is.

18012
04:53:35,260 --> 04:53:35,960
We are speaking

18013
04:53:35,960 --> 04:53:37,160
of music, madam.

18014
04:53:37,220 --> 04:53:38,180
Said he, when.

18015
04:53:38,180 --> 04:53:39,020
No longer able

18016
04:53:39,020 --> 04:53:40,220
to avoid a reply.

18017
04:53:40,880 --> 04:53:42,080
Of music,

18018
04:53:42,320 --> 04:53:43,200
then pray

18019
04:53:43,200 --> 04:53:44,400
speak aloud.

18020
04:53:44,400 --> 04:53:45,860
It is of all subjects,

18021
04:53:45,860 --> 04:53:47,060
my delight.

18022
04:53:47,060 --> 04:53:48,360
I must have my

18023
04:53:48,360 --> 04:53:48,800
share in

18024
04:53:48,800 --> 04:53:49,580
the conversation.

18025
04:53:49,580 --> 04:53:50,120
If you are

18026
04:53:50,120 --> 04:53:51,320
speaking of music.

18027
04:53:51,660 --> 04:53:52,760
There are few people

18028
04:53:52,760 --> 04:53:53,400
in England,

18029
04:53:53,400 --> 04:53:55,200
I suppose have more true

18030
04:53:55,200 --> 04:53:55,800
enjoyment of

18031
04:53:55,800 --> 04:53:57,000
music than myself

18032
04:53:57,200 --> 04:53:57,980
or of a better

18033
04:53:57,980 --> 04:53:59,180
natural taste.

18034
04:53:59,640 --> 04:54:00,960
If I had ever learned,

18035
04:54:00,980 --> 04:54:01,680
I should have been

18036
04:54:01,680 --> 04:54:02,880
a great proficient

18037
04:54:03,180 --> 04:54:04,500
and so would Anne,

18038
04:54:04,680 --> 04:54:05,480
if her health

18039
04:54:05,480 --> 04:54:06,300
had allowed her

18040
04:54:06,300 --> 04:54:07,500
to apply,

18041
04:54:07,560 --> 04:54:08,480
I am confident

18042
04:54:08,480 --> 04:54:08,920
that she would have

18043
04:54:08,920 --> 04:54:10,240
performed delightfully.

18044
04:54:10,760 --> 04:54:11,880
How does Georgiana

18045
04:54:11,880 --> 04:54:13,080
get on Darcy?

18046
04:54:13,700 --> 04:54:14,040
Mr.

18047
04:54:14,040 --> 04:54:14,720
Darcy spoke

18048
04:54:14,720 --> 04:54:15,400
with affectionate

18049
04:54:15,400 --> 04:54:16,400
praise of his sister's

18050
04:54:16,400 --> 04:54:17,600
proficiency.

18051
04:54:17,900 --> 04:54:19,500
I am very glad to hear

18052
04:54:19,500 --> 04:54:20,080
such a good

18053
04:54:20,080 --> 04:54:21,300
account of her.

18054
04:54:21,320 --> 04:54:22,520
Said Lady Catherine.

18055
04:54:22,640 --> 04:54:24,300
And pray her from me

18056
04:54:24,480 --> 04:54:25,740
that she cannot expect

18057
04:54:25,740 --> 04:54:26,920
to excel if she does not

18058
04:54:26,920 --> 04:54:28,580
practice a good deal.

18059
04:54:29,600 --> 04:54:30,800
I assure you, madam.

18060
04:54:31,240 --> 04:54:32,400
He replied.

18061
04:54:32,400 --> 04:54:33,240
That she does not need

18062
04:54:33,240 --> 04:54:34,220
such advice.

18063
04:54:34,220 --> 04:54:35,060
She practices

18064
04:54:35,060 --> 04:54:36,260
very constantly.

18065
04:54:36,740 --> 04:54:38,260
And so much the better.

18066
04:54:38,660 --> 04:54:39,760
It cannot be done

18067
04:54:39,760 --> 04:54:40,580
too much.

18068
04:54:40,580 --> 04:54:41,580
And when I next

18069
04:54:41,580 --> 04:54:42,440
write to her,

18070
04:54:42,440 --> 04:54:43,460
I shall charge

18071
04:54:43,460 --> 04:54:44,540
not to neglect it

18072
04:54:44,540 --> 04:54:45,740
on any account.

18073
04:54:46,100 --> 04:54:46,980
I often tell

18074
04:54:46,980 --> 04:54:47,640
young ladies

18075
04:54:47,640 --> 04:54:48,620
that no excellence

18076
04:54:48,620 --> 04:54:49,200
in music

18077
04:54:49,200 --> 04:54:49,900
is to be acquired

18078
04:54:49,900 --> 04:54:50,960
without constant

18079
04:54:50,960 --> 04:54:52,160
practice.

18080
04:54:52,220 --> 04:54:53,180
I have told Ms..

18081
04:54:53,180 --> 04:54:54,620
Bennett several times

18082
04:54:54,620 --> 04:54:54,960
that she will

18083
04:54:54,960 --> 04:54:56,300
never play really well

18084
04:54:56,300 --> 04:54:56,720
unless she

18085
04:54:56,720 --> 04:54:57,920
practices more.

18086
04:54:58,220 --> 04:54:59,000
And though Mrs.

18087
04:54:59,000 --> 04:54:59,720
Collins has

18088
04:54:59,720 --> 04:55:00,480
no instrument,

18089
04:55:00,480 --> 04:55:01,680
she is very welcome.

18090
04:55:01,800 --> 04:55:03,320
As I have often told her

18091
04:55:03,580 --> 04:55:04,640
to come to Rose

18092
04:55:04,640 --> 04:55:05,580
every day and play

18093
04:55:05,580 --> 04:55:06,100
on the piano

18094
04:55:06,100 --> 04:55:06,860
Forte and Mrs.

18095
04:55:06,860 --> 04:55:08,060
Jenkinson's room,

18096
04:55:08,260 --> 04:55:09,240
she would be in nobody's

18097
04:55:09,240 --> 04:55:09,800
way, you know.

18098
04:55:09,800 --> 04:55:10,420
And that part

18099
04:55:10,420 --> 04:55:11,640
of the house.

18100
04:55:11,880 --> 04:55:12,200
Mr.

18101
04:55:12,200 --> 04:55:13,040
Darcy looked little

18102
04:55:13,040 --> 04:55:13,580
ashamed of

18103
04:55:13,580 --> 04:55:14,780
his aunt's ill breeding

18104
04:55:14,880 --> 04:55:16,080
and made no answer.

18105
04:55:16,880 --> 04:55:17,420
When coffee.

18106
04:55:17,420 --> 04:55:17,960
Was over,

18107
04:55:17,960 --> 04:55:18,800
Colonel Fitzwilliam

18108
04:55:18,800 --> 04:55:19,600
reminded Elizabeth

18109
04:55:19,600 --> 04:55:19,980
of having

18110
04:55:19,980 --> 04:55:20,700
promised to play.

18111
04:55:20,700 --> 04:55:21,320
To him.

18112
04:55:21,320 --> 04:55:22,320
And she sat down

18113
04:55:22,320 --> 04:55:22,820
directly

18114
04:55:22,820 --> 04:55:23,920
to the instrument.

18115
04:55:23,920 --> 04:55:24,720
He drew a chair

18116
04:55:24,720 --> 04:55:25,640
near her.

18117
04:55:25,640 --> 04:55:26,420
Lady Catherine

18118
04:55:26,420 --> 04:55:27,060
listened to half a.

18119
04:55:27,060 --> 04:55:28,200
Song and then.

18120
04:55:28,200 --> 04:55:29,260
Talked as before

18121
04:55:29,260 --> 04:55:30,480
to the other nephew,

18122
04:55:30,480 --> 04:55:31,460
till the latter walked

18123
04:55:31,460 --> 04:55:32,300
away from her

18124
04:55:32,300 --> 04:55:32,880
and, making

18125
04:55:32,880 --> 04:55:33,140
with his

18126
04:55:33,140 --> 04:55:34,140
usual deliberation

18127
04:55:34,140 --> 04:55:35,340
towards the piano Forte.

18128
04:55:35,640 --> 04:55:36,060
Stationed.

18129
04:55:36,060 --> 04:55:37,200
Himself so as to command

18130
04:55:37,200 --> 04:55:38,360
a full view of the fair

18131
04:55:38,360 --> 04:55:39,560
performer's countenance.

18132
04:55:39,960 --> 04:55:40,680
Elizabeth saw

18133
04:55:40,680 --> 04:55:41,660
what he was doing

18134
04:55:41,660 --> 04:55:42,380
and at the

18135
04:55:42,380 --> 04:55:43,560
convenient pause

18136
04:55:43,560 --> 04:55:44,160
turned to him

18137
04:55:44,160 --> 04:55:44,640
with an arch

18138
04:55:44,640 --> 04:55:45,840
smile and said.

18139
04:55:46,500 --> 04:55:47,360
You mean to frighten

18140
04:55:47,360 --> 04:55:47,760
me, Mr.

18141
04:55:47,760 --> 04:55:48,180
Darcy,

18142
04:55:48,180 --> 04:55:49,140
by coming in all this

18143
04:55:49,140 --> 04:55:50,340
state to hear me?

18144
04:55:50,660 --> 04:55:51,920
I will not be alarmed.

18145
04:55:52,100 --> 04:55:53,120
Your sister does play

18146
04:55:53,120 --> 04:55:54,020
so well.

18147
04:55:54,020 --> 04:55:54,440
There is a.

18148
04:55:54,440 --> 04:55:55,500
Stubbornness about me

18149
04:55:55,500 --> 04:55:56,480
that never can bear

18150
04:55:56,480 --> 04:55:57,120
to be frightened

18151
04:55:57,120 --> 04:55:58,260
at the will of. Others.

18152
04:55:58,260 --> 04:55:58,820
My courage

18153
04:55:58,820 --> 04:56:00,420
always rises at every

18154
04:56:00,420 --> 04:56:01,680
attempt to intimidate.

18155
04:56:02,880 --> 04:56:03,420
I shall not

18156
04:56:03,420 --> 04:56:03,980
say that you

18157
04:56:03,980 --> 04:56:04,820
are mistaken.

18158
04:56:04,820 --> 04:56:05,580
He replied.

18159
04:56:05,580 --> 04:56:06,080
Because you could

18160
04:56:06,080 --> 04:56:07,080
not really believe me

18161
04:56:07,080 --> 04:56:07,620
to entertain

18162
04:56:07,620 --> 04:56:08,780
any design of alarming.

18163
04:56:08,780 --> 04:56:09,500
You and I

18164
04:56:09,500 --> 04:56:10,220
have had the pleasure

18165
04:56:10,220 --> 04:56:11,100
of your acquaintance

18166
04:56:11,100 --> 04:56:12,300
long enough to know

18167
04:56:12,320 --> 04:56:12,900
that you find

18168
04:56:12,900 --> 04:56:13,800
great enjoyment

18169
04:56:13,800 --> 04:56:14,480
in occasionally

18170
04:56:14,480 --> 04:56:15,680
professing opinions

18171
04:56:15,960 --> 04:56:17,000
which in fact

18172
04:56:17,000 --> 04:56:18,200
are not your own.

18173
04:56:18,540 --> 04:56:19,100
Elizabeth

18174
04:56:19,100 --> 04:56:19,940
laughed heartily

18175
04:56:19,940 --> 04:56:20,540
at this picture

18176
04:56:20,540 --> 04:56:21,320
of herself

18177
04:56:21,320 --> 04:56:21,920
and to

18178
04:56:21,920 --> 04:56:23,120
Colonel Fitzwilliam.

18179
04:56:23,280 --> 04:56:24,000
Your cousin

18180
04:56:24,000 --> 04:56:24,440
will give you

18181
04:56:24,440 --> 04:56:24,860
a very

18182
04:56:24,860 --> 04:56:26,060
pretty notion of me

18183
04:56:26,060 --> 04:56:26,840
and teach you

18184
04:56:26,840 --> 04:56:27,900
not to believe a word

18185
04:56:27,900 --> 04:56:28,980
I say.

18186
04:56:28,980 --> 04:56:29,400
I am

18187
04:56:29,400 --> 04:56:30,740
particularly unlucky

18188
04:56:30,740 --> 04:56:31,140
in meeting

18189
04:56:31,140 --> 04:56:32,460
with the person, so able

18190
04:56:32,460 --> 04:56:33,080
to expose

18191
04:56:33,080 --> 04:56:34,260
my real character

18192
04:56:34,260 --> 04:56:35,240
in a part of the world

18193
04:56:35,240 --> 04:56:35,760
where I'd hoped

18194
04:56:35,760 --> 04:56:36,780
to pass myself off

18195
04:56:36,780 --> 04:56:37,260
with some

18196
04:56:37,260 --> 04:56:38,460
degree of credit.

18197
04:56:38,720 --> 04:56:39,620
Indeed, Mr.

18198
04:56:39,620 --> 04:56:40,340
Darcy.

18199
04:56:40,340 --> 04:56:41,540
It is very

18200
04:56:41,580 --> 04:56:42,300
and you to mention

18201
04:56:42,300 --> 04:56:42,680
all that

18202
04:56:42,680 --> 04:56:43,020
you knew

18203
04:56:43,020 --> 04:56:44,000
to my disadvantage

18204
04:56:44,000 --> 04:56:45,200
in Hertfordshire

18205
04:56:45,320 --> 04:56:46,440
and give me leave to say

18206
04:56:46,440 --> 04:56:47,780
very impolitic too,

18207
04:56:48,020 --> 04:56:48,320
for it

18208
04:56:48,320 --> 04:56:49,100
is provoking me

18209
04:56:49,100 --> 04:56:50,780
to retaliate and such

18210
04:56:51,200 --> 04:56:52,140
may come out as will

18211
04:56:52,140 --> 04:56:53,160
shock your relations

18212
04:56:53,160 --> 04:56:54,360
to hear.

18213
04:56:54,480 --> 04:56:55,980
I am not afraid of you.

18214
04:56:56,400 --> 04:56:57,600
Said he smilingly.

18215
04:56:58,220 --> 04:56:58,500
Pray.

18216
04:56:58,500 --> 04:56:58,940
Let me hear

18217
04:56:58,940 --> 04:56:59,340
what you have

18218
04:56:59,340 --> 04:57:00,540
to accuse him of.

18219
04:57:00,600 --> 04:57:00,860
Pride,

18220
04:57:00,860 --> 04:57:02,060
Colonel Fitzwilliam.

18221
04:57:02,240 --> 04:57:02,760
I should like

18222
04:57:02,760 --> 04:57:03,300
to know how he

18223
04:57:03,300 --> 04:57:04,620
behaves among strangers.

18224
04:57:05,760 --> 04:57:06,960
You shall here, then

18225
04:57:07,160 --> 04:57:08,180
must prepare yourself

18226
04:57:08,180 --> 04:57:08,720
for something

18227
04:57:08,720 --> 04:57:09,920
very dreadful.

18228
04:57:10,080 --> 04:57:11,280
The first time of my

18229
04:57:11,280 --> 04:57:11,960
ever seeing him

18230
04:57:11,960 --> 04:57:12,600
in Hertfordshire.

18231
04:57:12,600 --> 04:57:14,060
You must know that bull.

18232
04:57:14,480 --> 04:57:15,300
And this bull.

18233
04:57:15,300 --> 04:57:15,840
What do you think

18234
04:57:15,840 --> 04:57:16,640
he did?

18235
04:57:16,640 --> 04:57:17,760
He danced only

18236
04:57:17,760 --> 04:57:19,160
for dances, though.

18237
04:57:19,160 --> 04:57:19,800
Gentlemen.

18238
04:57:19,800 --> 04:57:20,580
Scarce.

18239
04:57:20,580 --> 04:57:21,200
And to my

18240
04:57:21,200 --> 04:57:22,140
certain knowledge,

18241
04:57:22,140 --> 04:57:23,340
more than one young lady

18242
04:57:23,340 --> 04:57:24,060
was sitting down

18243
04:57:24,060 --> 04:57:25,260
in want of a partner.

18244
04:57:25,520 --> 04:57:25,880
Mr.

18245
04:57:25,880 --> 04:57:26,960
Darcy, you cannot.

18246
04:57:26,960 --> 04:57:28,160
Deny the fact.

18247
04:57:29,220 --> 04:57:30,320
I had not at that time

18248
04:57:30,320 --> 04:57:30,660
the honor

18249
04:57:30,660 --> 04:57:31,560
of knowing any lady

18250
04:57:31,560 --> 04:57:32,280
in the assembly

18251
04:57:32,280 --> 04:57:33,480
beyond my own party.

18252
04:57:34,980 --> 04:57:35,900
True.

18253
04:57:35,900 --> 04:57:37,160
And nobody can ever

18254
04:57:37,160 --> 04:57:37,820
be introduced

18255
04:57:37,820 --> 04:57:39,020
in a ballroom.

18256
04:57:39,240 --> 04:57:39,860
Well, kind of.

18257
04:57:39,860 --> 04:57:40,500
Fitzwilliam,

18258
04:57:40,500 --> 04:57:41,720
what do I play next?

18259
04:57:41,760 --> 04:57:42,420
My fingers

18260
04:57:42,420 --> 04:57:43,620
await your orders.

18261
04:57:44,460 --> 04:57:45,540
Perhaps.

18262
04:57:45,540 --> 04:57:46,740
Said Darcy.

18263
04:57:46,760 --> 04:57:47,480
I should have judged

18264
04:57:47,480 --> 04:57:47,940
better had

18265
04:57:47,940 --> 04:57:48,320
I sought

18266
04:57:48,320 --> 04:57:50,280
an introduction, but I.

18267
04:57:50,280 --> 04:57:51,000
I'm ill qualified

18268
04:57:51,000 --> 04:57:51,860
to recommend myself

18269
04:57:51,860 --> 04:57:52,560
to strangers.

18270
04:57:54,320 --> 04:57:55,380
Shall we ask your cousin

18271
04:57:55,380 --> 04:57:56,580
the reason of this?

18272
04:57:56,820 --> 04:57:57,900
Said Elizabeth, still

18273
04:57:57,900 --> 04:57:58,280
addressing

18274
04:57:58,280 --> 04:57:59,480
Colonel Fitzwilliam.

18275
04:57:59,520 --> 04:58:00,840
Shall we ask him why?

18276
04:58:00,840 --> 04:58:01,820
A man of sense.

18277
04:58:01,820 --> 04:58:02,640
And education

18278
04:58:02,640 --> 04:58:03,320
and who has lived in

18279
04:58:03,320 --> 04:58:04,040
the world

18280
04:58:04,040 --> 04:58:05,520
is ill qualified

18281
04:58:05,520 --> 04:58:06,500
to recommend himself

18282
04:58:06,500 --> 04:58:07,700
to strangers?

18283
04:58:07,980 --> 04:58:08,580
I can answer

18284
04:58:08,580 --> 04:58:09,440
your question,

18285
04:58:09,440 --> 04:58:10,340
said Fitzwilliam

18286
04:58:10,340 --> 04:58:11,540
without applying to him.

18287
04:58:12,120 --> 04:58:12,420
It is

18288
04:58:12,420 --> 04:58:12,960
because he will

18289
04:58:12,960 --> 04:58:13,620
not give himself

18290
04:58:13,620 --> 04:58:14,820
the trouble.

18291
04:58:15,200 --> 04:58:15,900
I certainly

18292
04:58:15,900 --> 04:58:16,640
have not the talent

18293
04:58:16,640 --> 04:58:17,040
which some

18294
04:58:17,040 --> 04:58:18,240
people possess,

18295
04:58:18,320 --> 04:58:19,520
said Darcy

18296
04:58:19,560 --> 04:58:20,760
of conversing easily

18297
04:58:20,760 --> 04:58:21,140
with those

18298
04:58:21,140 --> 04:58:21,620
I have never

18299
04:58:21,620 --> 04:58:22,820
seen before.

18300
04:58:22,860 --> 04:58:23,760
I cannot catch that

18301
04:58:23,760 --> 04:58:24,960
tone of conversation

18302
04:58:24,960 --> 04:58:25,440
or appear

18303
04:58:25,440 --> 04:58:26,060
interested in

18304
04:58:26,060 --> 04:58:27,200
their concerns,

18305
04:58:27,200 --> 04:58:28,500
as I often see done.

18306
04:58:29,280 --> 04:58:30,480
My fingers,

18307
04:58:30,600 --> 04:58:31,680
said Elizabeth.

18308
04:58:31,680 --> 04:58:32,720
Do not move over

18309
04:58:32,720 --> 04:58:33,500
this instrument

18310
04:58:33,500 --> 04:58:34,480
in the masterly manner

18311
04:58:34,480 --> 04:58:35,000
in which I see

18312
04:58:35,000 --> 04:58:36,200
so many women do.

18313
04:58:36,480 --> 04:58:37,340
They have not the same

18314
04:58:37,340 --> 04:58:38,540
force or rapidity

18315
04:58:38,820 --> 04:58:39,840
and do not produce

18316
04:58:39,840 --> 04:58:41,040
the same expression.

18317
04:58:41,400 --> 04:58:42,240
But then I have always

18318
04:58:42,240 --> 04:58:42,800
supposed it

18319
04:58:42,800 --> 04:58:44,000
to be my own fault

18320
04:58:44,160 --> 04:58:45,020
because I will not take

18321
04:58:45,020 --> 04:58:45,440
the trouble

18322
04:58:45,440 --> 04:58:46,640
of practicing.

18323
04:58:46,680 --> 04:58:47,400
It is not that

18324
04:58:47,400 --> 04:58:48,680
I do not believe fingers

18325
04:58:48,680 --> 04:58:49,260
as capable

18326
04:58:49,260 --> 04:58:50,120
as any other woman

18327
04:58:50,120 --> 04:58:51,560
of superior execution.

18328
04:58:52,500 --> 04:58:52,920
Darcy

18329
04:58:52,920 --> 04:58:54,120
smiled and said.

18330
04:58:54,660 --> 04:58:55,860
You are perfectly right.

18331
04:58:56,120 --> 04:58:56,820
You have employed

18332
04:58:56,820 --> 04:58:58,020
your time much better.

18333
04:58:58,320 --> 04:58:59,100
No one admitted

18334
04:58:59,100 --> 04:58:59,820
to the privilege

18335
04:58:59,820 --> 04:59:00,320
of hearing.

18336
04:59:00,320 --> 04:59:00,860
You can think

18337
04:59:00,860 --> 04:59:02,060
anything wanting.

18338
04:59:02,100 --> 04:59:02,960
We, neither of us

18339
04:59:02,960 --> 04:59:04,320
performed to strangers

18340
04:59:06,060 --> 04:59:06,420
here.

18341
04:59:06,420 --> 04:59:06,680
They were

18342
04:59:06,680 --> 04:59:07,880
interrupted by lady

18343
04:59:08,300 --> 04:59:09,360
who called out to know

18344
04:59:09,360 --> 04:59:09,720
what they were

18345
04:59:09,720 --> 04:59:10,760
talking of.

18346
04:59:10,760 --> 04:59:11,780
Elizabeth immediately

18347
04:59:11,780 --> 04:59:12,980
began playing again.

18348
04:59:13,160 --> 04:59:13,920
Lady Catherine

18349
04:59:13,920 --> 04:59:15,120
approached and after

18350
04:59:15,120 --> 04:59:15,440
listening

18351
04:59:15,440 --> 04:59:16,800
for a few minutes, said

18352
04:59:16,800 --> 04:59:18,000
to Darcy.

18353
04:59:18,140 --> 04:59:18,920
Miss Bennet

18354
04:59:18,920 --> 04:59:19,880
would not play at all

18355
04:59:19,880 --> 04:59:20,300
amiss

18356
04:59:20,300 --> 04:59:21,500
if she practiced more

18357
04:59:21,800 --> 04:59:22,340
and would have

18358
04:59:22,340 --> 04:59:23,100
the advantage

18359
04:59:23,100 --> 04:59:24,300
of a London master.

18360
04:59:24,680 --> 04:59:25,320
She has a very

18361
04:59:25,320 --> 04:59:25,820
good notion

18362
04:59:25,820 --> 04:59:26,640
of fingering,

18363
04:59:26,640 --> 04:59:27,680
though her taste is not

18364
04:59:27,680 --> 04:59:28,880
equal to arms

18365
04:59:28,920 --> 04:59:29,760
and would have been a

18366
04:59:29,760 --> 04:59:31,020
delightful performer

18367
04:59:31,320 --> 04:59:32,160
had her health

18368
04:59:32,160 --> 04:59:33,440
allowed her to learn.

18369
04:59:34,560 --> 04:59:35,100
Elizabeth

18370
04:59:35,100 --> 04:59:35,780
looked at Darcy

18371
04:59:35,780 --> 04:59:36,740
to see how cordially

18372
04:59:36,740 --> 04:59:37,220
he ascended

18373
04:59:37,220 --> 04:59:38,420
to his cousin's praise,

18374
04:59:38,580 --> 04:59:39,080
but neither

18375
04:59:39,080 --> 04:59:39,980
at that moment

18376
04:59:39,980 --> 04:59:40,920
nor any other

18377
04:59:40,920 --> 04:59:41,540
could she discern

18378
04:59:41,540 --> 04:59:42,740
any symptom of love.

18379
04:59:43,080 --> 04:59:43,260
And.

18380
04:59:43,260 --> 04:59:43,760
From the whole

18381
04:59:43,760 --> 04:59:44,780
of his behavior to Mr.

18382
04:59:44,780 --> 04:59:45,380
Burke.

18383
04:59:45,380 --> 04:59:46,700
She derived this comfort

18384
04:59:46,700 --> 04:59:47,720
from his bingley.

18385
04:59:47,720 --> 04:59:48,200
That he might.

18386
04:59:48,200 --> 04:59:48,500
Have been

18387
04:59:48,500 --> 04:59:49,160
just as likely

18388
04:59:49,160 --> 04:59:50,480
to marry her had

18389
04:59:50,480 --> 04:59:51,800
she been his relation.

18390
04:59:52,760 --> 04:59:53,520
Lady Catherine

18391
04:59:53,520 --> 04:59:54,480
continued her remarks

18392
04:59:54,480 --> 04:59:55,020
on Elizabeth's

18393
04:59:55,020 --> 04:59:55,880
performance.

18394
04:59:55,880 --> 04:59:56,540
Mixing with.

18395
04:59:56,540 --> 04:59:57,680
Their many instructions.

18396
04:59:57,680 --> 04:59:59,060
On execution and taste.

18397
04:59:59,460 --> 05:00:00,620
Elizabeth received them

18398
05:00:00,620 --> 05:00:00,980
with all the

18399
05:00:00,980 --> 05:00:02,280
forbearance of civility,

18400
05:00:02,540 --> 05:00:03,380
and at the request

18401
05:00:03,380 --> 05:00:04,260
of the gentleman,

18402
05:00:04,260 --> 05:00:04,700
remained

18403
05:00:04,700 --> 05:00:05,400
at the instrument

18404
05:00:05,400 --> 05:00:06,200
until her lady ships

18405
05:00:06,200 --> 05:00:06,740
carriage was

18406
05:00:06,740 --> 05:00:07,460
ready to take them

18407
05:00:07,460 --> 05:00:08,660
all home.

18408
05:00:10,560 --> 05:00:11,760
Chapter 32.

18409
05:00:12,200 --> 05:00:13,140
Elizabeth was sitting

18410
05:00:13,140 --> 05:00:13,740
by herself

18411
05:00:13,740 --> 05:00:14,600
the next morning

18412
05:00:14,600 --> 05:00:15,620
and writing to Jane

18413
05:00:15,620 --> 05:00:16,080
while Mrs.

18414
05:00:16,080 --> 05:00:17,120
Collins and Mariah

18415
05:00:17,120 --> 05:00:18,000
were gone on business

18416
05:00:18,000 --> 05:00:19,040
into the village.

18417
05:00:19,040 --> 05:00:19,460
When she

18418
05:00:19,460 --> 05:00:20,300
startled by a ring

18419
05:00:20,300 --> 05:00:21,060
at the door,

18420
05:00:21,060 --> 05:00:21,560
the sergeant

18421
05:00:21,560 --> 05:00:22,760
signal of a visitor

18422
05:00:23,160 --> 05:00:23,900
as she had heard

18423
05:00:23,900 --> 05:00:24,840
no carriage.

18424
05:00:24,840 --> 05:00:25,380
She thought it.

18425
05:00:25,380 --> 05:00:26,060
Not unlikely

18426
05:00:26,060 --> 05:00:27,260
to be Lady Catherine.

18427
05:00:27,320 --> 05:00:27,840
And under

18428
05:00:27,840 --> 05:00:28,980
that apprehension.

18429
05:00:28,980 --> 05:00:29,460
Was putting.

18430
05:00:29,460 --> 05:00:30,020
Away her half

18431
05:00:30,020 --> 05:00:30,620
finished letter

18432
05:00:30,620 --> 05:00:31,500
that she might escape

18433
05:00:31,500 --> 05:00:32,240
all impertinent

18434
05:00:32,240 --> 05:00:33,080
questions.

18435
05:00:33,080 --> 05:00:34,280
When the door opened

18436
05:00:34,280 --> 05:00:34,740
and to her

18437
05:00:34,740 --> 05:00:36,440
very great surprise, Mr.

18438
05:00:36,440 --> 05:00:37,680
Darcy and Mr.

18439
05:00:37,680 --> 05:00:38,880
Darcy only entered

18440
05:00:38,880 --> 05:00:40,080
the room.

18441
05:00:40,080 --> 05:00:40,500
He seemed

18442
05:00:40,500 --> 05:00:41,400
astonished, too,

18443
05:00:41,400 --> 05:00:42,600
at finding her alone

18444
05:00:42,620 --> 05:00:43,460
and apologized

18445
05:00:43,460 --> 05:00:44,220
for his intrusion

18446
05:00:44,220 --> 05:00:44,900
by letting her know

18447
05:00:44,900 --> 05:00:45,720
that he had understood

18448
05:00:45,720 --> 05:00:46,440
all the ladies

18449
05:00:46,440 --> 05:00:47,640
were to be within.

18450
05:00:47,840 --> 05:00:49,040
They then sat down,

18451
05:00:49,220 --> 05:00:50,220
and when her inquiries

18452
05:00:50,220 --> 05:00:51,420
after roses were made,

18453
05:00:51,500 --> 05:00:52,340
seemed in danger

18454
05:00:52,340 --> 05:00:52,940
of sinking into

18455
05:00:52,940 --> 05:00:54,140
total silence.

18456
05:00:54,360 --> 05:00:55,280
It was absolutely

18457
05:00:55,280 --> 05:00:56,220
necessary, therefore,

18458
05:00:56,220 --> 05:00:57,320
to think of something.

18459
05:00:57,320 --> 05:00:57,660
And in

18460
05:00:57,660 --> 05:00:58,380
this emergency

18461
05:00:58,380 --> 05:00:58,920
recollecting,

18462
05:00:58,920 --> 05:00:59,520
when she had

18463
05:00:59,520 --> 05:00:59,820
seen him

18464
05:00:59,820 --> 05:01:01,020
last in Hertfordshire

18465
05:01:01,040 --> 05:01:01,980
and feeling curious

18466
05:01:01,980 --> 05:01:02,360
to know what

18467
05:01:02,360 --> 05:01:02,780
he would say

18468
05:01:02,780 --> 05:01:03,360
on the subject

18469
05:01:03,360 --> 05:01:03,600
of their

18470
05:01:03,600 --> 05:01:04,800
hasty departure,

18471
05:01:04,800 --> 05:01:06,000
she observed.

18472
05:01:06,320 --> 05:01:07,180
How very suddenly

18473
05:01:07,180 --> 05:01:07,740
you will, quitted.

18474
05:01:07,740 --> 05:01:08,480
Netherfield last

18475
05:01:08,480 --> 05:01:09,120
November, Mr.

18476
05:01:09,120 --> 05:01:09,920
Darcy.

18477
05:01:09,920 --> 05:01:10,940
It must have been a most

18478
05:01:10,940 --> 05:01:11,900
agreeable surprise

18479
05:01:11,900 --> 05:01:12,260
to Mr.

18480
05:01:12,260 --> 05:01:13,140
Bingley to see you all

18481
05:01:13,140 --> 05:01:14,340
after him so soon,

18482
05:01:14,700 --> 05:01:15,000
for if

18483
05:01:15,000 --> 05:01:16,140
I recollect right.

18484
05:01:16,140 --> 05:01:17,220
He went back to the day

18485
05:01:17,220 --> 05:01:18,240
before

18486
05:01:18,240 --> 05:01:19,220
he and his sisters were.

18487
05:01:19,220 --> 05:01:20,000
Well, I hope when

18488
05:01:20,000 --> 05:01:20,820
you left London.

18489
05:01:21,920 --> 05:01:22,620
Perfectly so.

18490
05:01:22,620 --> 05:01:23,820
I thank you.

18491
05:01:24,360 --> 05:01:24,980
She found that

18492
05:01:24,980 --> 05:01:25,680
she was to receive

18493
05:01:25,680 --> 05:01:26,760
no other answer.

18494
05:01:26,760 --> 05:01:27,960
And after a short

18495
05:01:28,080 --> 05:01:29,120
added.

18496
05:01:29,120 --> 05:01:29,580
I think

18497
05:01:29,580 --> 05:01:30,260
I have understood

18498
05:01:30,260 --> 05:01:30,660
that Mr.

18499
05:01:30,660 --> 05:01:31,380
Bingley has

18500
05:01:31,380 --> 05:01:32,720
not much idea of ever

18501
05:01:32,720 --> 05:01:33,260
returning to

18502
05:01:33,260 --> 05:01:34,460
Netherfield again.

18503
05:01:35,300 --> 05:01:36,120
I have never heard him

18504
05:01:36,120 --> 05:01:37,340
say so, but

18505
05:01:37,460 --> 05:01:38,060
is probable

18506
05:01:38,060 --> 05:01:38,840
that he may spend

18507
05:01:38,840 --> 05:01:39,860
very little of his time

18508
05:01:39,860 --> 05:01:41,060
there in future.

18509
05:01:41,340 --> 05:01:42,540
He has many friends

18510
05:01:42,680 --> 05:01:43,200
and he is at

18511
05:01:43,200 --> 05:01:43,920
a time of life

18512
05:01:43,920 --> 05:01:44,460
when friends

18513
05:01:44,460 --> 05:01:45,140
and engagements

18514
05:01:45,140 --> 05:01:46,020
are continually

18515
05:01:46,020 --> 05:01:47,220
increasing.

18516
05:01:48,240 --> 05:01:49,200
If he means to be back

18517
05:01:49,200 --> 05:01:50,400
little at Netherfield,

18518
05:01:50,400 --> 05:01:51,020
it would be better

18519
05:01:51,020 --> 05:01:51,660
for the neighborhood

18520
05:01:51,660 --> 05:01:52,280
that he should give up

18521
05:01:52,280 --> 05:01:53,660
the place entirely for.

18522
05:01:53,660 --> 05:01:54,680
Then we might possibly

18523
05:01:54,680 --> 05:01:55,200
get a settled

18524
05:01:55,200 --> 05:01:56,400
family there.

18525
05:01:56,520 --> 05:01:57,560
But perhaps Mr.

18526
05:01:57,560 --> 05:01:58,200
Bingley did not

18527
05:01:58,200 --> 05:01:59,100
take the house too much

18528
05:01:59,100 --> 05:01:59,780
for the convenience

18529
05:01:59,780 --> 05:02:00,500
of the neighborhood

18530
05:02:00,500 --> 05:02:01,700
as for his own.

18531
05:02:01,760 --> 05:02:02,720
And we must expect him

18532
05:02:02,720 --> 05:02:03,240
to keep it

18533
05:02:03,240 --> 05:02:03,660
or quit

18534
05:02:03,660 --> 05:02:04,020
it on the

18535
05:02:04,020 --> 05:02:05,220
same principle.

18536
05:02:05,720 --> 05:02:07,020
I should be surprised,

18537
05:02:07,260 --> 05:02:08,160
said Darcy.

18538
05:02:08,160 --> 05:02:09,140
If he were to give it up

18539
05:02:09,140 --> 05:02:10,220
as soon as any eligible

18540
05:02:10,220 --> 05:02:11,420
purchase offers.

18541
05:02:11,760 --> 05:02:12,540
Elizabeth made

18542
05:02:12,540 --> 05:02:13,500
no answer.

18543
05:02:13,500 --> 05:02:14,220
She was afraid

18544
05:02:14,220 --> 05:02:14,660
of talking

18545
05:02:14,660 --> 05:02:15,860
longer of his friend.

18546
05:02:15,860 --> 05:02:16,280
And having

18547
05:02:16,280 --> 05:02:17,480
nothing else to say

18548
05:02:17,480 --> 05:02:17,880
was now.

18549
05:02:17,880 --> 05:02:18,300
Determined

18550
05:02:18,300 --> 05:02:19,020
to leave the trouble of

18551
05:02:19,020 --> 05:02:19,380
finding a

18552
05:02:19,380 --> 05:02:20,420
subject to him.

18553
05:02:21,420 --> 05:02:21,900
He took the

18554
05:02:21,900 --> 05:02:23,180
hint and soon began.

18555
05:02:23,180 --> 05:02:24,240
With.

18556
05:02:24,240 --> 05:02:24,680
This seems

18557
05:02:24,680 --> 05:02:24,920
a very

18558
05:02:24,920 --> 05:02:26,040
comfortable house.

18559
05:02:26,040 --> 05:02:26,720
Lady Katharine,

18560
05:02:26,720 --> 05:02:27,320
I believe, did

18561
05:02:27,320 --> 05:02:28,100
a great deal to it

18562
05:02:28,100 --> 05:02:28,520
when Mr.

18563
05:02:28,520 --> 05:02:28,860
Collins

18564
05:02:28,860 --> 05:02:30,060
first came to Hansford.

18565
05:02:31,080 --> 05:02:32,280
I believe she did,

18566
05:02:32,420 --> 05:02:33,380
and I am sure she could

18567
05:02:33,380 --> 05:02:34,080
not have bestowed

18568
05:02:34,080 --> 05:02:34,740
her kindness

18569
05:02:34,740 --> 05:02:35,040
on a more

18570
05:02:35,040 --> 05:02:36,240
grateful object.

18571
05:02:37,580 --> 05:02:37,820
Mr.

18572
05:02:37,820 --> 05:02:38,400
Collins appears

18573
05:02:38,400 --> 05:02:39,180
very fortunate

18574
05:02:39,180 --> 05:02:40,380
in his choice of a wife.

18575
05:02:40,820 --> 05:02:41,960
Yes, indeed.

18576
05:02:41,960 --> 05:02:42,620
His friends

18577
05:02:42,620 --> 05:02:43,320
may well rejoice

18578
05:02:43,320 --> 05:02:44,000
in his having met

18579
05:02:44,000 --> 05:02:44,420
with one of the

18580
05:02:44,420 --> 05:02:45,660
very few sensible women

18581
05:02:45,660 --> 05:02:45,980
who would have

18582
05:02:45,980 --> 05:02:46,980
accepted him

18583
05:02:46,980 --> 05:02:47,940
or have made him happy

18584
05:02:47,940 --> 05:02:49,080
if they had.

18585
05:02:49,080 --> 05:02:49,740
My friend

18586
05:02:49,740 --> 05:02:49,980
has an

18587
05:02:49,980 --> 05:02:51,240
excellent understanding,

18588
05:02:51,680 --> 05:02:52,580
though I am not certain

18589
05:02:52,580 --> 05:02:53,300
that I consider her

18590
05:02:53,300 --> 05:02:53,780
marrying Mr.

18591
05:02:53,780 --> 05:02:54,240
Collins

18592
05:02:54,240 --> 05:02:55,160
as the wisest thing

18593
05:02:55,160 --> 05:02:56,360
she did.

18594
05:02:56,400 --> 05:02:57,320
She seems perfectly

18595
05:02:57,320 --> 05:02:58,460
happy, however,

18596
05:02:58,460 --> 05:02:58,760
and in a

18597
05:02:58,760 --> 05:02:59,700
prudential light.

18598
05:02:59,700 --> 05:03:00,260
It is certainly

18599
05:03:00,260 --> 05:03:00,660
a very good

18600
05:03:00,660 --> 05:03:01,340
match for her.

18601
05:03:02,820 --> 05:03:03,300
It must be

18602
05:03:03,300 --> 05:03:03,980
very agreeable

18603
05:03:03,980 --> 05:03:05,180
to her to be settled

18604
05:03:05,220 --> 05:03:06,380
so easy a distance

18605
05:03:06,380 --> 05:03:07,140
of her own family

18606
05:03:07,140 --> 05:03:08,060
and friends.

18607
05:03:08,060 --> 05:03:09,060
An easy distance,

18608
05:03:09,060 --> 05:03:09,960
do you call it?

18609
05:03:09,960 --> 05:03:11,340
It is nearly 50 miles

18610
05:03:11,880 --> 05:03:12,060
on.

18611
05:03:12,060 --> 05:03:12,680
What is 50

18612
05:03:12,680 --> 05:03:13,880
miles of good road?

18613
05:03:13,980 --> 05:03:14,540
Little more than.

18614
05:03:14,540 --> 05:03:15,720
Half a day's journey.

18615
05:03:15,720 --> 05:03:16,020
Yes.

18616
05:03:16,020 --> 05:03:16,460
I call it

18617
05:03:16,460 --> 05:03:17,660
a very easy distance.

18618
05:03:18,660 --> 05:03:19,460
I should never have

18619
05:03:19,460 --> 05:03:20,460
considered the distance

18620
05:03:20,460 --> 05:03:20,940
as one of the

18621
05:03:20,940 --> 05:03:22,200
advantages of the match.

18622
05:03:22,500 --> 05:03:23,700
Cried Elizabeth.

18623
05:03:23,820 --> 05:03:24,660
I should never have

18624
05:03:24,660 --> 05:03:25,140
said Mrs.

18625
05:03:25,140 --> 05:03:25,920
Collins was settled

18626
05:03:25,920 --> 05:03:27,120
near her family.

18627
05:03:27,840 --> 05:03:28,700
It is a proof of

18628
05:03:28,700 --> 05:03:29,640
your own attachment

18629
05:03:29,640 --> 05:03:30,620
to Hertfordshire.

18630
05:03:30,620 --> 05:03:31,400
Anything beyond

18631
05:03:31,400 --> 05:03:32,220
the very neighborhood

18632
05:03:32,220 --> 05:03:32,780
of Long Bourne,

18633
05:03:32,780 --> 05:03:33,480
I suppose, would

18634
05:03:33,480 --> 05:03:34,680
appear far.

18635
05:03:34,940 --> 05:03:35,660
As he spoke,

18636
05:03:35,660 --> 05:03:35,960
there was a

18637
05:03:35,960 --> 05:03:36,680
sort of smile

18638
05:03:36,680 --> 05:03:37,680
which Elizabeth fancied

18639
05:03:37,680 --> 05:03:38,760
she understood.

18640
05:03:38,760 --> 05:03:39,840
He must be supposing her

18641
05:03:39,840 --> 05:03:40,880
to be thinking of Jane

18642
05:03:40,880 --> 05:03:42,000
and Netherfield.

18643
05:03:42,000 --> 05:03:42,860
And she blushed

18644
05:03:42,860 --> 05:03:44,060
as she answered.

18645
05:03:44,520 --> 05:03:45,200
I do not.

18646
05:03:45,200 --> 05:03:45,800
Mean to say that

18647
05:03:45,800 --> 05:03:46,260
a woman may.

18648
05:03:46,260 --> 05:03:47,040
Not be settled

18649
05:03:47,040 --> 05:03:48,260
to near her family

18650
05:03:48,720 --> 05:03:49,200
this far.

18651
05:03:49,200 --> 05:03:49,500
And then

18652
05:03:49,500 --> 05:03:50,700
there must be relative

18653
05:03:50,900 --> 05:03:51,960
and depend on many

18654
05:03:51,960 --> 05:03:53,400
varying circumstances.

18655
05:03:53,900 --> 05:03:54,400
Well, there is

18656
05:03:54,400 --> 05:03:54,980
fortune to.

18657
05:03:54,980 --> 05:03:55,920
Make the expenses

18658
05:03:55,920 --> 05:03:56,480
of traveling.

18659
05:03:56,480 --> 05:03:57,960
Unimportant distance

18660
05:03:57,960 --> 05:03:59,160
becomes no evil.

18661
05:03:59,360 --> 05:04:00,420
But that is not the case

18662
05:04:00,420 --> 05:04:01,160
here.

18663
05:04:01,160 --> 05:04:02,040
Mr. and Mrs.

18664
05:04:02,040 --> 05:04:02,460
Collins

18665
05:04:02,460 --> 05:04:03,060
have a comfortable

18666
05:04:03,060 --> 05:04:03,860
income,

18667
05:04:03,860 --> 05:04:04,860
but not such a one

18668
05:04:04,860 --> 05:04:05,100
as will

18669
05:04:05,100 --> 05:04:05,940
allow of frequent

18670
05:04:05,940 --> 05:04:06,840
journeys.

18671
05:04:06,840 --> 05:04:07,820
And I am persuaded

18672
05:04:07,820 --> 05:04:08,460
my friend would

18673
05:04:08,460 --> 05:04:09,300
not call herself

18674
05:04:09,300 --> 05:04:10,500
near her family.

18675
05:04:10,560 --> 05:04:11,880
Under less than half

18676
05:04:11,880 --> 05:04:13,080
the pleasant distance.

18677
05:04:13,680 --> 05:04:14,000
Mr.

18678
05:04:14,000 --> 05:04:15,120
Darcy drew his chair

18679
05:04:15,120 --> 05:04:15,860
a little towards

18680
05:04:15,860 --> 05:04:17,060
her and said.

18681
05:04:17,420 --> 05:04:18,360
You cannot have a right

18682
05:04:18,360 --> 05:04:18,920
to such a very

18683
05:04:18,920 --> 05:04:20,300
strong local attachment.

18684
05:04:21,480 --> 05:04:22,080
You cannot have

18685
05:04:22,080 --> 05:04:23,640
been always at born.

18686
05:04:24,560 --> 05:04:25,100
Elizabeth

18687
05:04:25,100 --> 05:04:26,300
looked surprised.

18688
05:04:26,400 --> 05:04:26,960
The gentleman

18689
05:04:26,960 --> 05:04:27,500
experienced

18690
05:04:27,500 --> 05:04:28,700
some change of feeling.

18691
05:04:28,760 --> 05:04:29,960
He drew back his chair,

18692
05:04:29,960 --> 05:04:30,300
took a.

18693
05:04:30,300 --> 05:04:30,840
Newspaper

18694
05:04:30,840 --> 05:04:31,760
from the table,

18695
05:04:31,760 --> 05:04:33,060
and glancing it

18696
05:04:33,060 --> 05:04:34,280
sat in a colder voice.

18697
05:04:35,220 --> 05:04:35,780
Are you pleased

18698
05:04:35,780 --> 05:04:36,980
with Kent?

18699
05:04:37,400 --> 05:04:37,920
A short

18700
05:04:37,920 --> 05:04:39,120
dialog on the subject

18701
05:04:39,120 --> 05:04:40,320
of the country ensued

18702
05:04:40,340 --> 05:04:40,920
on either

18703
05:04:40,920 --> 05:04:42,420
side, calm and concise.

18704
05:04:42,660 --> 05:04:43,800
And soon put an end.

18705
05:04:43,800 --> 05:04:44,640
To by the entrance

18706
05:04:44,640 --> 05:04:45,180
of Charlotte,

18707
05:04:45,180 --> 05:04:45,980
and her sister

18708
05:04:45,980 --> 05:04:46,680
just returned

18709
05:04:46,680 --> 05:04:47,660
from her walk.

18710
05:04:47,660 --> 05:04:48,260
The tattered

18711
05:04:48,260 --> 05:04:49,460
hat surprised them.

18712
05:04:49,760 --> 05:04:50,100
Mr.

18713
05:04:50,100 --> 05:04:50,820
Darcy related

18714
05:04:50,820 --> 05:04:51,320
the mistake

18715
05:04:51,320 --> 05:04:52,520
which had occasion to,

18716
05:04:52,560 --> 05:04:52,880
on Mr.

18717
05:04:52,880 --> 05:04:53,700
Bennett hand

18718
05:04:53,700 --> 05:04:54,260
after sitting

18719
05:04:54,260 --> 05:04:55,100
a few minutes longer

18720
05:04:55,100 --> 05:04:55,680
without saying

18721
05:04:55,680 --> 05:04:56,700
much to anybody.

18722
05:04:56,700 --> 05:04:57,900
Went away.

18723
05:04:58,400 --> 05:04:58,920
What can.

18724
05:04:58,920 --> 05:04:59,460
Be the meaning of.

18725
05:04:59,460 --> 05:05:00,320
This?

18726
05:05:00,320 --> 05:05:01,080
Said Charlotte.

18727
05:05:01,080 --> 05:05:02,280
As soon as he was gone.

18728
05:05:02,480 --> 05:05:03,620
My dear Eliza.

18729
05:05:03,620 --> 05:05:04,380
He must be in

18730
05:05:04,380 --> 05:05:05,120
love with you.

18731
05:05:05,120 --> 05:05:05,540
Oh, he would

18732
05:05:05,540 --> 05:05:06,680
never have called on us

18733
05:05:06,680 --> 05:05:07,880
in this familiar way.

18734
05:05:08,480 --> 05:05:09,240
But when Elizabeth

18735
05:05:09,240 --> 05:05:10,440
told of his silence,

18736
05:05:10,460 --> 05:05:11,160
it did not seem

18737
05:05:11,160 --> 05:05:11,900
very likely

18738
05:05:11,900 --> 05:05:12,300
even to

18739
05:05:12,300 --> 05:05:13,380
Charlotte's wishes

18740
05:05:13,380 --> 05:05:14,460
to be the case.

18741
05:05:14,460 --> 05:05:15,480
And after various

18742
05:05:15,480 --> 05:05:16,340
conjectures,

18743
05:05:16,340 --> 05:05:17,160
they could at last

18744
05:05:17,160 --> 05:05:18,260
only suppose his visit

18745
05:05:18,260 --> 05:05:18,780
to proceed

18746
05:05:18,780 --> 05:05:19,560
from the difficulty

18747
05:05:19,560 --> 05:05:19,980
of finding

18748
05:05:19,980 --> 05:05:21,060
anything to do,

18749
05:05:21,060 --> 05:05:21,480
which was the

18750
05:05:21,480 --> 05:05:22,140
more probable

18751
05:05:22,140 --> 05:05:23,340
from the time of year.

18752
05:05:23,480 --> 05:05:24,140
All field

18753
05:05:24,140 --> 05:05:25,340
sports were over

18754
05:05:25,380 --> 05:05:26,180
within doors.

18755
05:05:26,180 --> 05:05:26,700
There was Lady

18756
05:05:26,700 --> 05:05:27,680
Catherine books

18757
05:05:27,680 --> 05:05:28,880
and a billiards table.

18758
05:05:29,000 --> 05:05:30,060
But a gentleman cannot

18759
05:05:30,060 --> 05:05:31,340
always be within doors

18760
05:05:31,580 --> 05:05:32,360
and in the nearness

18761
05:05:32,360 --> 05:05:33,200
of the parsonage

18762
05:05:33,200 --> 05:05:33,960
or the pleasantness

18763
05:05:33,960 --> 05:05:35,240
of the walk to it, or

18764
05:05:35,240 --> 05:05:35,760
of the people

18765
05:05:35,760 --> 05:05:36,620
who lived in it.

18766
05:05:36,620 --> 05:05:37,440
The two cousins

18767
05:05:37,440 --> 05:05:38,420
found a temptation

18768
05:05:38,420 --> 05:05:39,120
from this period

18769
05:05:39,120 --> 05:05:39,920
of walking thither

18770
05:05:39,920 --> 05:05:41,120
almost every day.

18771
05:05:41,420 --> 05:05:41,960
They called

18772
05:05:41,960 --> 05:05:42,780
at various times

18773
05:05:42,780 --> 05:05:43,520
of the morning,

18774
05:05:43,520 --> 05:05:44,660
sometimes separately,

18775
05:05:44,660 --> 05:05:45,800
sometimes together,

18776
05:05:45,800 --> 05:05:46,280
and now

18777
05:05:46,280 --> 05:05:47,040
and then accompanied

18778
05:05:47,040 --> 05:05:48,080
by their aunt.

18779
05:05:48,080 --> 05:05:49,280
It was plain to them all

18780
05:05:49,280 --> 05:05:49,760
that Colonel

18781
05:05:49,760 --> 05:05:50,580
Fitzwilliam came

18782
05:05:50,580 --> 05:05:51,620
because he had pleasure,

18783
05:05:51,620 --> 05:05:52,740
their society.

18784
05:05:52,740 --> 05:05:53,400
Of persuasion.

18785
05:05:53,400 --> 05:05:53,940
Which of course

18786
05:05:53,940 --> 05:05:54,540
recommended him

18787
05:05:54,540 --> 05:05:55,460
still more.

18788
05:05:55,460 --> 05:05:56,100
And Elizabeth

18789
05:05:56,100 --> 05:05:56,600
was reminded

18790
05:05:56,600 --> 05:05:57,720
by her own satisfaction

18791
05:05:57,720 --> 05:05:58,680
in being with him,

18792
05:05:58,680 --> 05:05:59,460
as well as by

18793
05:05:59,460 --> 05:06:00,620
his evident admiration

18794
05:06:00,620 --> 05:06:01,880
of her, of former

18795
05:06:01,880 --> 05:06:03,080
favorite George Wickham.

18796
05:06:03,480 --> 05:06:04,080
And though in.

18797
05:06:04,080 --> 05:06:05,160
Comparing them, she saw

18798
05:06:05,160 --> 05:06:05,640
there was less

18799
05:06:05,640 --> 05:06:06,200
captivating

18800
05:06:06,200 --> 05:06:07,080
softness in Colonel

18801
05:06:07,080 --> 05:06:08,280
Fitzwilliams manners.

18802
05:06:08,340 --> 05:06:09,140
She believed he.

18803
05:06:09,140 --> 05:06:09,900
Might have the best

18804
05:06:09,900 --> 05:06:11,100
informed mind.

18805
05:06:11,460 --> 05:06:12,140
But why Mr.

18806
05:06:12,140 --> 05:06:12,840
Darcy came

18807
05:06:12,840 --> 05:06:13,440
so often to

18808
05:06:13,440 --> 05:06:14,280
the parsonage.

18809
05:06:14,280 --> 05:06:15,300
It was more difficult

18810
05:06:15,300 --> 05:06:16,460
to understand.

18811
05:06:16,460 --> 05:06:17,300
It could not be for.

18812
05:06:17,300 --> 05:06:18,200
Society,

18813
05:06:18,200 --> 05:06:18,980
as he frequently

18814
05:06:18,980 --> 05:06:19,440
sat there

18815
05:06:19,440 --> 05:06:20,340
10 minutes together

18816
05:06:20,340 --> 05:06:21,540
without opening lips.

18817
05:06:21,840 --> 05:06:22,860
And when he did speak,

18818
05:06:22,860 --> 05:06:23,160
it seemed.

18819
05:06:23,160 --> 05:06:24,300
The effect of necessity

18820
05:06:24,300 --> 05:06:25,440
rather than of choice.

18821
05:06:25,440 --> 05:06:26,300
A sacrifice

18822
05:06:26,300 --> 05:06:27,200
to propriety.

18823
05:06:27,200 --> 05:06:27,560
Not a.

18824
05:06:27,560 --> 05:06:28,760
Pleasure to himself.

18825
05:06:29,100 --> 05:06:30,060
He seldom appeared

18826
05:06:30,060 --> 05:06:31,260
really animated.

18827
05:06:31,520 --> 05:06:31,880
Mrs.

18828
05:06:31,880 --> 05:06:32,540
Collins knew

18829
05:06:32,540 --> 05:06:33,740
not what to make of him.

18830
05:06:34,080 --> 05:06:35,040
Colonel Fitzwilliams,

18831
05:06:35,040 --> 05:06:35,540
occasionally

18832
05:06:35,540 --> 05:06:36,120
laughing at

18833
05:06:36,120 --> 05:06:37,440
his stupidity, proved

18834
05:06:37,440 --> 05:06:37,800
that he was

18835
05:06:37,800 --> 05:06:38,840
generally different,

18836
05:06:38,840 --> 05:06:39,380
which her own

18837
05:06:39,380 --> 05:06:39,960
knowledge of him

18838
05:06:39,960 --> 05:06:41,100
could not have told her.

18839
05:06:41,100 --> 05:06:41,480
And as

18840
05:06:41,480 --> 05:06:42,020
she would like

18841
05:06:42,020 --> 05:06:42,800
to believe this

18842
05:06:42,800 --> 05:06:43,340
change the

18843
05:06:43,340 --> 05:06:44,360
effect of love

18844
05:06:44,360 --> 05:06:45,420
and the object of that

18845
05:06:45,420 --> 05:06:46,620
love, her friend Eliza,

18846
05:06:46,820 --> 05:06:47,600
she set herself

18847
05:06:47,600 --> 05:06:48,540
seriously at work

18848
05:06:48,540 --> 05:06:49,700
to find it out.

18849
05:06:49,700 --> 05:06:50,460
She watched him

18850
05:06:50,460 --> 05:06:51,080
whenever were

18851
05:06:51,080 --> 05:06:51,780
at Rose Kings

18852
05:06:51,780 --> 05:06:52,280
and whenever

18853
05:06:52,280 --> 05:06:53,480
he came to Hansford.

18854
05:06:53,480 --> 05:06:54,060
But without

18855
05:06:54,060 --> 05:06:55,260
much success,

18856
05:06:55,340 --> 05:06:56,100
he certainly looked

18857
05:06:56,100 --> 05:06:56,540
at her friend

18858
05:06:56,540 --> 05:06:57,420
a great deal.

18859
05:06:57,420 --> 05:06:58,200
But the expression

18860
05:06:58,200 --> 05:06:58,500
of that

18861
05:06:58,500 --> 05:06:59,700
look was disputable.

18862
05:07:00,000 --> 05:07:00,920
It was an

18863
05:07:00,920 --> 05:07:02,120
steadfast gaze.

18864
05:07:02,400 --> 05:07:03,560
But she often doubted.

18865
05:07:03,560 --> 05:07:04,020
Whether there were

18866
05:07:04,020 --> 05:07:05,220
much admiration in it.

18867
05:07:05,340 --> 05:07:05,580
And.

18868
05:07:05,580 --> 05:07:06,200
Sometimes it

18869
05:07:06,200 --> 05:07:06,960
seemed nothing

18870
05:07:06,960 --> 05:07:08,300
but absence of mind.

18871
05:07:09,080 --> 05:07:09,660
She had once.

18872
05:07:09,660 --> 05:07:10,520
Or twice suggested

18873
05:07:10,520 --> 05:07:11,060
to Elizabeth

18874
05:07:11,060 --> 05:07:12,080
the possibility of his

18875
05:07:12,080 --> 05:07:13,280
being partial to her.

18876
05:07:13,380 --> 05:07:14,000
But Elizabeth

18877
05:07:14,000 --> 05:07:14,780
always laughed

18878
05:07:14,780 --> 05:07:16,320
at the idea, and Mrs.

18879
05:07:16,320 --> 05:07:16,700
Collins

18880
05:07:16,700 --> 05:07:17,580
did not think it right

18881
05:07:17,580 --> 05:07:18,780
to press the subject

18882
05:07:18,780 --> 05:07:19,440
from the danger

18883
05:07:19,440 --> 05:07:20,700
of raising expectations,

18884
05:07:20,700 --> 05:07:21,660
which might only end

18885
05:07:21,660 --> 05:07:22,860
in disappointment.

18886
05:07:22,880 --> 05:07:23,820
For, in her opinion,

18887
05:07:23,820 --> 05:07:24,300
it admitted

18888
05:07:24,300 --> 05:07:25,620
not of a doubt that all

18889
05:07:25,620 --> 05:07:26,480
her friends dislike

18890
05:07:26,480 --> 05:07:27,260
would vanish.

18891
05:07:27,260 --> 05:07:28,160
If she could suppose.

18892
05:07:28,160 --> 05:07:29,360
Him to be in her power

18893
05:07:30,140 --> 05:07:30,900
in her kind

18894
05:07:30,900 --> 05:07:32,100
schemes for Elizabeth.

18895
05:07:32,180 --> 05:07:32,940
She sometimes

18896
05:07:32,940 --> 05:07:33,840
planned her marrying

18897
05:07:33,840 --> 05:07:35,040
Colonel Fitzwilliam.

18898
05:07:35,040 --> 05:07:35,400
He was,

18899
05:07:35,400 --> 05:07:36,360
beyond comparison,

18900
05:07:36,360 --> 05:07:37,560
the most pleasant man.

18901
05:07:37,580 --> 05:07:38,600
He certainly admired

18902
05:07:38,600 --> 05:07:39,200
her and.

18903
05:07:39,200 --> 05:07:40,200
His situation in life

18904
05:07:40,200 --> 05:07:41,400
was most eligible.

18905
05:07:41,540 --> 05:07:42,720
But to counterbalance

18906
05:07:42,720 --> 05:07:44,100
these advantages, Mr.

18907
05:07:44,100 --> 05:07:45,140
Darcy had considerable

18908
05:07:45,140 --> 05:07:46,340
patronage in the church,

18909
05:07:46,460 --> 05:07:47,220
and his cousin

18910
05:07:47,220 --> 05:07:48,420
could have none at all.

18911
05:07:50,580 --> 05:07:51,780
Chapter 33.

18912
05:07:52,880 --> 05:07:53,640
More than once

18913
05:07:53,640 --> 05:07:54,320
did Elizabeth

18914
05:07:54,320 --> 05:07:54,960
in her ramble

18915
05:07:54,960 --> 05:07:55,880
within the park,

18916
05:07:55,880 --> 05:07:57,380
unexpectedly meet Mr.

18917
05:07:57,380 --> 05:07:58,260
Darcy.

18918
05:07:58,260 --> 05:07:58,800
She felt

18919
05:07:58,800 --> 05:07:59,640
all the perverse

18920
05:07:59,640 --> 05:08:00,560
ness of the Miss Chance

18921
05:08:00,560 --> 05:08:01,220
that should bring him

18922
05:08:01,220 --> 05:08:01,860
where no one else

18923
05:08:01,860 --> 05:08:02,700
was brought

18924
05:08:02,700 --> 05:08:03,480
and to prevent

18925
05:08:03,480 --> 05:08:04,260
its ever happening

18926
05:08:04,260 --> 05:08:04,920
again.

18927
05:08:04,920 --> 05:08:06,240
Took care to inform him

18928
05:08:06,240 --> 05:08:06,740
at first

18929
05:08:06,740 --> 05:08:07,680
that it was a favorite

18930
05:08:07,680 --> 05:08:08,880
haunt of hers.

18931
05:08:09,020 --> 05:08:09,800
How it could occur

18932
05:08:09,800 --> 05:08:10,560
a second time,

18933
05:08:10,560 --> 05:08:11,940
therefore was very odd.

18934
05:08:12,420 --> 05:08:13,620
Yet it's dead.

18935
05:08:13,680 --> 05:08:14,880
And even a third.

18936
05:08:15,260 --> 05:08:16,140
It seemed like

18937
05:08:16,140 --> 05:08:17,480
willful ill nature

18938
05:08:17,580 --> 05:08:18,980
or a voluntary penance,

18939
05:08:19,260 --> 05:08:19,800
for on these.

18940
05:08:19,800 --> 05:08:20,900
Occasions it was not.

18941
05:08:20,900 --> 05:08:21,300
Merely

18942
05:08:21,300 --> 05:08:22,440
a few formal inquiries

18943
05:08:22,440 --> 05:08:23,540
and an awkward pause

18944
05:08:23,540 --> 05:08:24,620
and then away.

18945
05:08:24,620 --> 05:08:25,380
But he actually.

18946
05:08:25,380 --> 05:08:25,760
Thought it

18947
05:08:25,760 --> 05:08:27,080
necessary to turn back

18948
05:08:27,080 --> 05:08:28,280
and walk with her.

18949
05:08:28,340 --> 05:08:29,060
He never said

18950
05:08:29,060 --> 05:08:29,900
a good deal,

18951
05:08:29,900 --> 05:08:30,920
nor did she give herself

18952
05:08:30,920 --> 05:08:31,940
the trouble of talking

18953
05:08:31,940 --> 05:08:33,140
or of listening much.

18954
05:08:33,140 --> 05:08:33,920
But it struck her

18955
05:08:33,920 --> 05:08:34,400
in the course

18956
05:08:34,400 --> 05:08:35,720
of their third rencontre

18957
05:08:35,900 --> 05:08:36,780
that he was asking

18958
05:08:36,780 --> 05:08:38,040
some odd, unconnected

18959
05:08:39,000 --> 05:08:39,440
about her

18960
05:08:39,440 --> 05:08:40,280
pleasure and being at.

18961
05:08:40,280 --> 05:08:41,000
Hunt's offered

18962
05:08:41,000 --> 05:08:41,540
her love

18963
05:08:41,540 --> 05:08:42,740
of solitary walks

18964
05:08:42,780 --> 05:08:43,860
and her opinion of Mr.

18965
05:08:43,860 --> 05:08:44,240
and Mrs.

18966
05:08:44,240 --> 05:08:45,440
Collins happiness

18967
05:08:45,660 --> 05:08:46,520
and that and speaking

18968
05:08:46,520 --> 05:08:47,240
of Rose Ings

18969
05:08:47,240 --> 05:08:47,640
and her

18970
05:08:47,640 --> 05:08:48,300
not perfectly

18971
05:08:48,300 --> 05:08:49,500
understanding the House.

18972
05:08:49,680 --> 05:08:50,820
He seemed to expect that

18973
05:08:50,820 --> 05:08:51,620
whenever she came into

18974
05:08:51,620 --> 05:08:52,440
Kent again.

18975
05:08:52,440 --> 05:08:52,860
She would be

18976
05:08:52,860 --> 05:08:54,080
staying there too.

18977
05:08:54,420 --> 05:08:55,160
His words

18978
05:08:55,160 --> 05:08:56,360
seemed to imply it.

18979
05:08:56,720 --> 05:08:57,600
Could he have Colonel

18980
05:08:57,600 --> 05:08:58,080
Fitzwilliam

18981
05:08:58,080 --> 05:08:59,120
in his thoughts?

18982
05:08:59,120 --> 05:08:59,880
She supposed

18983
05:08:59,880 --> 05:09:00,240
if he meant.

18984
05:09:00,240 --> 05:09:00,680
Anything,

18985
05:09:00,680 --> 05:09:01,700
he must mean an allusion

18986
05:09:01,700 --> 05:09:02,640
to what might arise

18987
05:09:02,640 --> 05:09:03,840
in that quarter.

18988
05:09:03,840 --> 05:09:04,700
It's distressed her

18989
05:09:04,700 --> 05:09:05,360
a little,

18990
05:09:05,360 --> 05:09:06,420
and he was quite glad

18991
05:09:06,420 --> 05:09:07,100
to find herself

18992
05:09:07,100 --> 05:09:08,300
at the gate in the Pales

18993
05:09:08,720 --> 05:09:09,920
the parsonage.

18994
05:09:10,220 --> 05:09:10,980
She was engaged

18995
05:09:10,980 --> 05:09:11,900
one day as she walked.

18996
05:09:11,900 --> 05:09:12,420
In, perusing

18997
05:09:12,420 --> 05:09:13,620
Jane's last letter

18998
05:09:13,820 --> 05:09:14,480
and dwelling

18999
05:09:14,480 --> 05:09:15,300
on some passages

19000
05:09:15,300 --> 05:09:15,900
which proved that

19001
05:09:15,900 --> 05:09:16,580
Jane had not

19002
05:09:16,580 --> 05:09:18,200
written in spirits when.

19003
05:09:18,200 --> 05:09:18,980
Instead of being again

19004
05:09:18,980 --> 05:09:19,860
surprised by Mr.

19005
05:09:19,860 --> 05:09:20,600
Darcy.

19006
05:09:20,600 --> 05:09:21,240
She saw and.

19007
05:09:21,240 --> 05:09:21,680
Looking up

19008
05:09:21,680 --> 05:09:22,580
that Colonel Fitzwilliam

19009
05:09:22,580 --> 05:09:23,760
was meeting her,

19010
05:09:23,760 --> 05:09:24,780
putting away her letter

19011
05:09:24,780 --> 05:09:25,280
immediately

19012
05:09:25,280 --> 05:09:26,280
and forcing a smile.

19013
05:09:26,280 --> 05:09:27,480
She said,

19014
05:09:27,480 --> 05:09:28,280
I did not

19015
05:09:28,280 --> 05:09:28,740
before that

19016
05:09:28,740 --> 05:09:29,280
you ever walked

19017
05:09:29,280 --> 05:09:30,480
this way.

19018
05:09:30,560 --> 05:09:31,220
I have been making

19019
05:09:31,220 --> 05:09:32,240
the tour of the park.

19020
05:09:32,240 --> 05:09:33,200
He replied.

19021
05:09:33,200 --> 05:09:34,100
As I generally do

19022
05:09:34,100 --> 05:09:34,980
every year,

19023
05:09:34,980 --> 05:09:36,080
and intended to close it

19024
05:09:36,080 --> 05:09:36,500
with a call

19025
05:09:36,500 --> 05:09:37,640
at the parsonage.

19026
05:09:37,640 --> 05:09:38,160
Are you going

19027
05:09:38,160 --> 05:09:39,240
much farther?

19028
05:09:39,240 --> 05:09:39,740
No.

19029
05:09:39,740 --> 05:09:40,140
I should have

19030
05:09:40,140 --> 05:09:41,340
turned in a moment.

19031
05:09:41,640 --> 05:09:42,360
And accordingly

19032
05:09:42,360 --> 05:09:43,340
she did turn

19033
05:09:43,340 --> 05:09:44,360
and they walked towards

19034
05:09:44,360 --> 05:09:45,480
the parsonage together.

19035
05:09:46,500 --> 05:09:47,420
Do you suddenly leave

19036
05:09:47,420 --> 05:09:48,620
Kent on Saturday?

19037
05:09:48,740 --> 05:09:49,640
She said.

19038
05:09:49,640 --> 05:09:50,600
Yes, if Darcy does

19039
05:09:50,600 --> 05:09:51,800
not put it off again.

19040
05:09:51,980 --> 05:09:52,440
But I am

19041
05:09:52,440 --> 05:09:53,640
at his disposal.

19042
05:09:53,700 --> 05:09:54,740
He arranges the business

19043
05:09:54,740 --> 05:09:55,940
just as he pleases.

19044
05:09:56,400 --> 05:09:57,320
And if not able to

19045
05:09:57,320 --> 05:09:58,080
please himself

19046
05:09:58,080 --> 05:09:59,100
in the arrangement,

19047
05:09:59,100 --> 05:10:00,000
he has at least.

19048
05:10:00,000 --> 05:10:00,420
Pleasure

19049
05:10:00,420 --> 05:10:01,200
in the great power.

19050
05:10:01,200 --> 05:10:02,220
Of choice.

19051
05:10:02,220 --> 05:10:03,320
I do not know anybody

19052
05:10:03,320 --> 05:10:03,980
who seems more

19053
05:10:03,980 --> 05:10:04,880
to enjoy the power

19054
05:10:04,880 --> 05:10:05,940
of doing what he likes

19055
05:10:05,940 --> 05:10:06,360
than Mr.

19056
05:10:06,360 --> 05:10:07,560
Darcy.

19057
05:10:08,540 --> 05:10:09,080
He likes to

19058
05:10:09,080 --> 05:10:09,720
have his own way.

19059
05:10:09,720 --> 05:10:10,460
Very well.

19060
05:10:10,460 --> 05:10:10,920
Replied

19061
05:10:10,920 --> 05:10:12,120
Colonel Fitzwilliam.

19062
05:10:12,180 --> 05:10:13,380
But so we all do.

19063
05:10:13,620 --> 05:10:13,940
It is

19064
05:10:13,940 --> 05:10:14,340
only that

19065
05:10:14,340 --> 05:10:15,200
he has better means

19066
05:10:15,200 --> 05:10:15,740
of having it

19067
05:10:15,740 --> 05:10:16,880
than many others

19068
05:10:16,880 --> 05:10:18,000
because he is rich

19069
05:10:18,000 --> 05:10:18,480
and many

19070
05:10:18,480 --> 05:10:19,680
others are poor.

19071
05:10:19,700 --> 05:10:20,580
I speak feeling

19072
05:10:20,580 --> 05:10:21,840
like a younger son,

19073
05:10:21,840 --> 05:10:22,440
you know.

19074
05:10:22,440 --> 05:10:23,160
Must be inured

19075
05:10:23,160 --> 05:10:23,940
to self-denial.

19076
05:10:23,940 --> 05:10:24,620
Independence

19077
05:10:26,460 --> 05:10:27,360
in my opinion.

19078
05:10:27,360 --> 05:10:27,780
The youngest

19079
05:10:27,780 --> 05:10:28,820
son of an earl can know

19080
05:10:28,820 --> 05:10:30,020
very little of either.

19081
05:10:30,260 --> 05:10:31,520
Now, seriously, what.

19082
05:10:31,520 --> 05:10:32,420
Have you ever known of?

19083
05:10:32,420 --> 05:10:33,320
Self-denial?

19084
05:10:33,320 --> 05:10:34,520
Independence.

19085
05:10:34,560 --> 05:10:35,000
When have you

19086
05:10:35,000 --> 05:10:35,760
been prevented

19087
05:10:35,760 --> 05:10:36,960
by want of money going

19088
05:10:36,960 --> 05:10:38,000
wherever you chose

19089
05:10:38,000 --> 05:10:39,080
or preparing anything

19090
05:10:39,080 --> 05:10:40,280
you had a fancy for?

19091
05:10:41,040 --> 05:10:41,580
These are home

19092
05:10:41,580 --> 05:10:42,480
questions,

19093
05:10:42,480 --> 05:10:43,620
and perhaps I cannot say

19094
05:10:43,620 --> 05:10:44,520
that I have experienced

19095
05:10:44,520 --> 05:10:45,260
many hardships

19096
05:10:45,260 --> 05:10:46,460
of that nature.

19097
05:10:46,560 --> 05:10:47,240
But in matters of

19098
05:10:47,240 --> 05:10:48,180
greater weight,

19099
05:10:48,180 --> 05:10:49,080
I may suffer from

19100
05:10:49,080 --> 05:10:50,280
the want of money.

19101
05:10:50,360 --> 05:10:51,060
Younger sons

19102
05:10:51,060 --> 05:10:51,680
cannot marry

19103
05:10:51,680 --> 05:10:52,880
where they like.

19104
05:10:52,880 --> 05:10:54,260
And less where they like

19105
05:10:54,260 --> 05:10:54,620
women of.

19106
05:10:54,620 --> 05:10:55,700
Fortune, which I think

19107
05:10:55,700 --> 05:10:56,940
very often they do.

19108
05:10:57,600 --> 05:10:58,680
Our habits of expense

19109
05:10:58,680 --> 05:10:59,880
make us too dependent,

19110
05:11:00,060 --> 05:11:00,900
and there are not many

19111
05:11:00,900 --> 05:11:02,040
in my rank of life

19112
05:11:02,040 --> 05:11:03,080
who can afford to marry

19113
05:11:03,080 --> 05:11:03,860
without some attention

19114
05:11:03,860 --> 05:11:05,040
to money.

19115
05:11:05,040 --> 05:11:06,120
Is this.

19116
05:11:06,120 --> 05:11:07,320
Thought Elizabeth.

19117
05:11:07,320 --> 05:11:08,520
Meant for me?

19118
05:11:08,820 --> 05:11:09,600
And she colored

19119
05:11:09,600 --> 05:11:10,640
at the idea.

19120
05:11:10,640 --> 05:11:11,880
But recovering herself

19121
05:11:11,880 --> 05:11:13,080
said in a lively town.

19122
05:11:13,640 --> 05:11:14,360
And pray.

19123
05:11:14,360 --> 05:11:15,480
What is the usual price

19124
05:11:15,480 --> 05:11:16,680
of an old younger son?

19125
05:11:16,920 --> 05:11:18,020
Unless the elder brother

19126
05:11:18,020 --> 05:11:18,800
is very sickly,

19127
05:11:18,800 --> 05:11:19,260
I suppose

19128
05:11:19,260 --> 05:11:19,440
you would

19129
05:11:19,440 --> 05:11:21,480
not ask about ?50,000.

19130
05:11:21,960 --> 05:11:22,680
He answered her

19131
05:11:22,680 --> 05:11:23,660
in the same style

19132
05:11:23,660 --> 05:11:24,900
and the subject dropped

19133
05:11:25,560 --> 05:11:26,580
to a silence,

19134
05:11:26,580 --> 05:11:26,900
which might

19135
05:11:26,900 --> 05:11:27,560
make him fancy

19136
05:11:27,560 --> 05:11:28,160
her affected

19137
05:11:28,160 --> 05:11:29,280
with what had passed.

19138
05:11:29,280 --> 05:11:30,300
She soon afterwards

19139
05:11:30,300 --> 05:11:31,320
said.

19140
05:11:31,320 --> 05:11:31,920
I imagine

19141
05:11:31,920 --> 05:11:32,420
your cousin

19142
05:11:32,420 --> 05:11:33,060
brought you down

19143
05:11:33,060 --> 05:11:33,320
with him.

19144
05:11:33,320 --> 05:11:33,720
Chiefly

19145
05:11:33,720 --> 05:11:34,260
for the sake of

19146
05:11:34,260 --> 05:11:35,160
having someone at his.

19147
05:11:35,160 --> 05:11:36,240
Disposal.

19148
05:11:36,240 --> 05:11:37,100
I wonder he does

19149
05:11:37,100 --> 05:11:38,360
not marry to secure

19150
05:11:38,360 --> 05:11:39,540
a lasting convenience

19151
05:11:39,540 --> 05:11:40,740
of that kind,

19152
05:11:40,820 --> 05:11:42,140
but perhaps his sister

19153
05:11:42,140 --> 05:11:42,660
does as well

19154
05:11:42,660 --> 05:11:43,560
for the present,

19155
05:11:43,560 --> 05:11:44,280
and as she is

19156
05:11:44,280 --> 05:11:45,480
under his so care,

19157
05:11:45,500 --> 05:11:46,620
he may do what he likes

19158
05:11:46,620 --> 05:11:46,980
with her.

19159
05:11:47,940 --> 05:11:48,860
No, said

19160
05:11:48,860 --> 05:11:50,060
Colonel Fitzwilliam.

19161
05:11:50,180 --> 05:11:51,180
That is an advantage

19162
05:11:51,180 --> 05:11:51,560
which he must

19163
05:11:51,560 --> 05:11:52,760
divide with me.

19164
05:11:52,820 --> 05:11:53,660
I am joined with him

19165
05:11:53,660 --> 05:11:54,420
in the guardianship

19166
05:11:54,420 --> 05:11:55,620
of Miss Darcy.

19167
05:11:56,060 --> 05:11:57,260
Oh, you indeed.

19168
05:11:57,260 --> 05:11:57,840
And pray,

19169
05:11:57,840 --> 05:11:58,860
what sort of guardians

19170
05:11:58,860 --> 05:11:59,660
do you make?

19171
05:11:59,660 --> 05:12:00,440
Does your charge

19172
05:12:00,440 --> 05:12:01,560
give you much trouble?

19173
05:12:01,560 --> 05:12:02,780
Young ladies of her age

19174
05:12:02,780 --> 05:12:03,320
are sometimes

19175
05:12:03,320 --> 05:12:03,560
a little

19176
05:12:03,560 --> 05:12:04,760
difficult to manage.

19177
05:12:04,800 --> 05:12:05,840
And she has the true

19178
05:12:05,840 --> 05:12:06,960
Darcy spirit.

19179
05:12:06,960 --> 05:12:08,060
She may like to have

19180
05:12:08,060 --> 05:12:09,260
her own way.

19181
05:12:09,600 --> 05:12:10,620
As she spoke,

19182
05:12:10,620 --> 05:12:11,360
she observed him

19183
05:12:11,360 --> 05:12:12,560
looking at her earnestly

19184
05:12:12,660 --> 05:12:13,280
and the manner

19185
05:12:13,280 --> 05:12:13,580
in which

19186
05:12:13,580 --> 05:12:14,300
he immediately

19187
05:12:14,300 --> 05:12:14,880
asked her why.

19188
05:12:14,880 --> 05:12:15,420
She suppose

19189
05:12:15,420 --> 05:12:16,380
Miss Darcy likely

19190
05:12:16,380 --> 05:12:16,740
to give them

19191
05:12:16,740 --> 05:12:17,840
any uneasiness,

19192
05:12:17,840 --> 05:12:18,480
convinced her

19193
05:12:18,480 --> 05:12:19,280
that she had somehow

19194
05:12:19,280 --> 05:12:19,680
or other

19195
05:12:19,680 --> 05:12:20,340
got pretty near

19196
05:12:20,340 --> 05:12:21,240
the truth.

19197
05:12:21,240 --> 05:12:22,440
She directly replied.

19198
05:12:23,220 --> 05:12:23,660
You need not

19199
05:12:23,660 --> 05:12:24,440
be frightened.

19200
05:12:24,440 --> 05:12:25,520
I never heard any harm

19201
05:12:25,520 --> 05:12:26,840
of her, and I dare say

19202
05:12:26,840 --> 05:12:27,080
she is

19203
05:12:27,080 --> 05:12:27,360
one of the

19204
05:12:27,360 --> 05:12:27,980
most tractable

19205
05:12:27,980 --> 05:12:29,180
creatures in the world.

19206
05:12:29,240 --> 05:12:29,780
She is a very

19207
05:12:29,780 --> 05:12:30,480
great favorite

19208
05:12:30,480 --> 05:12:31,100
with some ladies

19209
05:12:31,100 --> 05:12:32,180
of my acquaintance.

19210
05:12:32,180 --> 05:12:32,520
Mrs.

19211
05:12:32,520 --> 05:12:33,720
Hurst and Miss Bingley.

19212
05:12:34,040 --> 05:12:34,920
I think I have heard you

19213
05:12:34,920 --> 05:12:35,820
say that you know them.

19214
05:12:36,800 --> 05:12:37,920
I know them a little.

19215
05:12:37,920 --> 05:12:38,120
Their

19216
05:12:38,120 --> 05:12:39,080
brother is a pleasant

19217
05:12:39,080 --> 05:12:40,280
gentleman like man.

19218
05:12:40,280 --> 05:12:40,640
He is a

19219
05:12:40,640 --> 05:12:41,840
great friend of doses.

19220
05:12:42,000 --> 05:12:42,920
Oh, yes.

19221
05:12:42,920 --> 05:12:44,120
Said Elizabeth dryly.

19222
05:12:44,360 --> 05:12:44,760
Mr.

19223
05:12:44,760 --> 05:12:46,280
Darcy is uncommonly kind

19224
05:12:46,280 --> 05:12:46,620
to Mr.

19225
05:12:46,620 --> 05:12:47,220
Bingley

19226
05:12:47,220 --> 05:12:47,600
and takes

19227
05:12:47,600 --> 05:12:48,380
a prodigious deal

19228
05:12:48,380 --> 05:12:49,580
of care of him.

19229
05:12:50,000 --> 05:12:51,200
Care of him?

19230
05:12:51,320 --> 05:12:51,620
Yes.

19231
05:12:51,620 --> 05:12:52,200
I really believe

19232
05:12:52,200 --> 05:12:53,000
Darcy does

19233
05:12:53,000 --> 05:12:53,640
take care of him

19234
05:12:53,640 --> 05:12:54,260
in those points

19235
05:12:54,260 --> 05:12:54,860
where he most

19236
05:12:54,860 --> 05:12:56,060
wants care.

19237
05:12:56,160 --> 05:12:56,720
From something

19238
05:12:56,720 --> 05:12:57,300
that he told me.

19239
05:12:57,300 --> 05:12:58,500
And our journey hither.

19240
05:12:58,500 --> 05:12:59,060
I have reason

19241
05:12:59,060 --> 05:12:59,700
to think Bingley

19242
05:12:59,700 --> 05:13:00,060
very much

19243
05:13:00,060 --> 05:13:01,260
indebted to him.

19244
05:13:01,400 --> 05:13:02,120
But I ought to beg

19245
05:13:02,120 --> 05:13:02,660
his pardon.

19246
05:13:02,660 --> 05:13:03,140
For

19247
05:13:03,140 --> 05:13:03,800
I have no right

19248
05:13:03,800 --> 05:13:04,400
to suppose that

19249
05:13:04,400 --> 05:13:05,000
Bingley was the

19250
05:13:05,000 --> 05:13:06,200
person meant

19251
05:13:06,240 --> 05:13:07,440
it was all conjecture.

19252
05:13:08,360 --> 05:13:09,560
What is it you mean?

19253
05:13:09,900 --> 05:13:10,940
It is a circumstance

19254
05:13:10,940 --> 05:13:12,140
which Darcy, of course,

19255
05:13:12,260 --> 05:13:12,840
could not wish

19256
05:13:12,840 --> 05:13:14,040
to be generally known.

19257
05:13:14,240 --> 05:13:15,020
Because if it were to

19258
05:13:15,020 --> 05:13:15,480
get round

19259
05:13:15,480 --> 05:13:16,680
to the lady's family,

19260
05:13:16,800 --> 05:13:17,280
it would be an

19261
05:13:17,280 --> 05:13:18,480
unpleasant thing.

19262
05:13:18,600 --> 05:13:19,520
You may depend upon

19263
05:13:19,520 --> 05:13:20,600
my not mentioning it.

19264
05:13:21,960 --> 05:13:22,740
And remember that I

19265
05:13:22,740 --> 05:13:23,640
have not much reason

19266
05:13:23,640 --> 05:13:24,200
supposing it

19267
05:13:24,200 --> 05:13:25,400
to be Bingley.

19268
05:13:26,120 --> 05:13:26,780
What he told me

19269
05:13:26,780 --> 05:13:27,980
was merely this

19270
05:13:28,080 --> 05:13:28,340
that he

19271
05:13:28,340 --> 05:13:29,600
congratulated himself

19272
05:13:29,600 --> 05:13:30,360
on having lately

19273
05:13:30,360 --> 05:13:31,040
saved a friend

19274
05:13:31,040 --> 05:13:32,300
from the inconveniences

19275
05:13:32,300 --> 05:13:33,500
of a most imprudent.

19276
05:13:36,440 --> 05:13:36,980
But without

19277
05:13:36,980 --> 05:13:38,160
mentioning names

19278
05:13:38,160 --> 05:13:38,600
or any

19279
05:13:38,600 --> 05:13:39,800
other particulars,

19280
05:13:39,800 --> 05:13:41,000
and I only suspected it

19281
05:13:41,000 --> 05:13:42,000
to be Bingley

19282
05:13:42,000 --> 05:13:42,900
from believing him,

19283
05:13:42,900 --> 05:13:43,800
the kind of young man

19284
05:13:43,800 --> 05:13:44,340
to get into a

19285
05:13:44,340 --> 05:13:45,540
scrape of that sort,

19286
05:13:45,740 --> 05:13:46,860
and from knowing them

19287
05:13:46,860 --> 05:13:47,640
to have been together

19288
05:13:47,640 --> 05:13:48,020
the whole

19289
05:13:48,020 --> 05:13:49,220
of last summer.

19290
05:13:50,460 --> 05:13:50,880
Did Mr.

19291
05:13:50,880 --> 05:13:51,980
Darcy give you reasons

19292
05:13:51,980 --> 05:13:53,220
for this interference?

19293
05:13:53,840 --> 05:13:54,620
I understood that

19294
05:13:54,620 --> 05:13:54,900
there were

19295
05:13:54,900 --> 05:13:55,620
some very strong

19296
05:13:55,620 --> 05:13:56,160
objections

19297
05:13:56,160 --> 05:13:57,360
against the lady.

19298
05:13:57,800 --> 05:13:59,580
And what art did he use

19299
05:13:59,580 --> 05:14:00,780
to separate them?

19300
05:14:01,020 --> 05:14:01,820
He did not talk to me

19301
05:14:01,820 --> 05:14:03,000
of his own arts.

19302
05:14:03,000 --> 05:14:03,780
Said Fitzwilliam,

19303
05:14:03,780 --> 05:14:04,760
smiling.

19304
05:14:04,760 --> 05:14:05,600
He Only told me

19305
05:14:05,600 --> 05:14:06,000
what I have

19306
05:14:06,000 --> 05:14:07,200
now told you.

19307
05:14:07,580 --> 05:14:08,940
Elizabeth made no answer

19308
05:14:09,180 --> 05:14:10,800
and walked on her heart,

19309
05:14:10,800 --> 05:14:11,420
swelling with.

19310
05:14:11,420 --> 05:14:12,620
Indignation.

19311
05:14:12,680 --> 05:14:13,580
After watching her

19312
05:14:13,580 --> 05:14:14,180
a little.

19313
05:14:14,180 --> 05:14:15,180
Fitzwilliam her

19314
05:14:15,180 --> 05:14:15,660
why she was

19315
05:14:15,660 --> 05:14:16,380
so thoughtful.

19316
05:14:17,360 --> 05:14:18,060
I am thinking of

19317
05:14:18,060 --> 05:14:18,400
what you've

19318
05:14:18,400 --> 05:14:19,460
been telling me,

19319
05:14:19,460 --> 05:14:20,520
said she.

19320
05:14:20,520 --> 05:14:21,840
Your cousin's conduct

19321
05:14:21,840 --> 05:14:22,440
does not suit

19322
05:14:22,440 --> 05:14:23,520
my feelings.

19323
05:14:23,520 --> 05:14:24,420
Why was he to be

19324
05:14:24,420 --> 05:14:25,620
the judge?

19325
05:14:26,280 --> 05:14:26,780
You are rather

19326
05:14:26,780 --> 05:14:27,540
disposed to call

19327
05:14:27,540 --> 05:14:28,220
his interference

19328
05:14:28,220 --> 05:14:29,420
officious.

19329
05:14:30,080 --> 05:14:31,340
I do not see what right.

19330
05:14:31,340 --> 05:14:31,580
Mr.

19331
05:14:31,580 --> 05:14:32,780
Darcy had to decide

19332
05:14:32,780 --> 05:14:33,740
on the propriety of his.

19333
05:14:33,740 --> 05:14:34,940
Friends in coronation,

19334
05:14:35,160 --> 05:14:35,640
or why,

19335
05:14:35,640 --> 05:14:36,600
upon his own judgment

19336
05:14:36,600 --> 05:14:36,920
alone,

19337
05:14:36,920 --> 05:14:37,940
he was to determine

19338
05:14:37,940 --> 05:14:38,360
and direct

19339
05:14:38,360 --> 05:14:39,080
in what manner

19340
05:14:39,080 --> 05:14:39,560
his friend

19341
05:14:39,560 --> 05:14:40,760
was to be happy.

19342
05:14:41,540 --> 05:14:42,420
But.

19343
05:14:42,420 --> 05:14:43,100
She continued,

19344
05:14:43,100 --> 05:14:44,300
recollecting,

19345
05:14:44,480 --> 05:14:45,060
as we know,

19346
05:14:45,060 --> 05:14:45,960
none of the particulars.

19347
05:14:45,960 --> 05:14:46,680
It is not fair

19348
05:14:46,680 --> 05:14:47,820
to condemn him.

19349
05:14:47,820 --> 05:14:48,540
It is not to be.

19350
05:14:48,540 --> 05:14:49,140
Suppose that

19351
05:14:49,140 --> 05:14:49,640
there was much

19352
05:14:49,640 --> 05:14:50,840
affection in the case.

19353
05:14:52,100 --> 05:14:52,640
That is not

19354
05:14:52,640 --> 05:14:53,840
an unnatural surmise,

19355
05:14:54,080 --> 05:14:55,280
said Fitzwilliam.

19356
05:14:55,320 --> 05:14:56,160
But it is lessening

19357
05:14:56,160 --> 05:14:56,580
the honor

19358
05:14:56,580 --> 05:14:57,600
of my cousin's triumph.

19359
05:14:57,600 --> 05:14:58,800
Very sadly.

19360
05:14:59,220 --> 05:14:59,640
This was.

19361
05:14:59,640 --> 05:15:00,840
Spoken justly.

19362
05:15:00,860 --> 05:15:01,820
But it appeared to her.

19363
05:15:01,820 --> 05:15:03,140
So just a picture of Mr.

19364
05:15:03,140 --> 05:15:03,860
Darcy.

19365
05:15:03,860 --> 05:15:04,580
That she would not.

19366
05:15:04,580 --> 05:15:05,220
Trust herself

19367
05:15:05,220 --> 05:15:06,240
with an answer

19368
05:15:06,240 --> 05:15:07,760
and therefore abruptly

19369
05:15:07,760 --> 05:15:08,240
changing

19370
05:15:08,240 --> 05:15:09,500
the conversation talked

19371
05:15:09,500 --> 05:15:10,440
on indifferent matters

19372
05:15:10,440 --> 05:15:11,220
until they reached the.

19373
05:15:11,220 --> 05:15:12,380
Parsonage.

19374
05:15:12,380 --> 05:15:13,940
Their shut into own room

19375
05:15:13,940 --> 05:15:14,280
as soon as

19376
05:15:14,280 --> 05:15:15,480
their visitor left them.

19377
05:15:15,560 --> 05:15:16,140
She could think

19378
05:15:16,140 --> 05:15:17,000
without interruption

19379
05:15:17,000 --> 05:15:17,400
of all that

19380
05:15:17,400 --> 05:15:18,500
she had heard.

19381
05:15:18,500 --> 05:15:19,080
It was not to

19382
05:15:19,080 --> 05:15:19,880
be suppose that.

19383
05:15:19,880 --> 05:15:20,640
Any other people

19384
05:15:20,640 --> 05:15:21,180
could be meant

19385
05:15:21,180 --> 05:15:21,980
than those with whom.

19386
05:15:21,980 --> 05:15:23,180
She was connected.

19387
05:15:23,280 --> 05:15:24,240
There could not exist

19388
05:15:24,240 --> 05:15:24,780
in the world

19389
05:15:24,780 --> 05:15:26,120
two men over whom Mr.

19390
05:15:26,120 --> 05:15:26,820
Darcy could have

19391
05:15:26,820 --> 05:15:27,660
such boundless.

19392
05:15:27,660 --> 05:15:28,700
Influence

19393
05:15:28,700 --> 05:15:29,280
that he had been.

19394
05:15:29,280 --> 05:15:29,720
Concerned

19395
05:15:29,720 --> 05:15:30,540
in the measures taken

19396
05:15:30,540 --> 05:15:31,100
to separate

19397
05:15:31,100 --> 05:15:31,940
Bingley and Jane.

19398
05:15:31,940 --> 05:15:33,140
She had never doubted.

19399
05:15:33,200 --> 05:15:33,440
But she.

19400
05:15:33,440 --> 05:15:34,340
Had always attributed

19401
05:15:34,340 --> 05:15:35,060
to Miss Bingley

19402
05:15:35,060 --> 05:15:36,060
the principal design

19403
05:15:36,060 --> 05:15:37,260
and arrangement of them.

19404
05:15:37,500 --> 05:15:37,920
If his.

19405
05:15:37,920 --> 05:15:38,640
Own vanity,

19406
05:15:38,640 --> 05:15:38,960
however,

19407
05:15:38,960 --> 05:15:40,160
did not mislead him.

19408
05:15:40,160 --> 05:15:41,360
He was the cause.

19409
05:15:41,420 --> 05:15:42,140
His pride.

19410
05:15:42,140 --> 05:15:42,860
And Caprice,

19411
05:15:42,860 --> 05:15:44,060
the cause of all

19412
05:15:44,060 --> 05:15:45,120
the Jane had suffered.

19413
05:15:45,120 --> 05:15:46,080
And still continue

19414
05:15:46,080 --> 05:15:47,060
to suffer.

19415
05:15:47,060 --> 05:15:48,000
He had ruined for

19416
05:15:48,000 --> 05:15:48,380
a while

19417
05:15:48,380 --> 05:15:49,680
every hope of happiness

19418
05:15:49,860 --> 05:15:50,100
for the

19419
05:15:50,100 --> 05:15:51,060
most affectionate,

19420
05:15:51,060 --> 05:15:51,540
generous

19421
05:15:51,540 --> 05:15:52,740
heart in the world.

19422
05:15:52,740 --> 05:15:53,480
And no one could.

19423
05:15:53,480 --> 05:15:54,540
Say how lasting an

19424
05:15:54,540 --> 05:15:55,220
evil he might

19425
05:15:55,220 --> 05:15:55,940
have inflicted.

19426
05:15:57,240 --> 05:15:57,540
There were

19427
05:15:57,540 --> 05:15:57,980
some very

19428
05:15:57,980 --> 05:15:58,820
strong objections

19429
05:15:58,820 --> 05:16:00,020
against the lady.

19430
05:16:00,060 --> 05:16:00,600
What Colonel

19431
05:16:00,600 --> 05:16:01,800
Fitzwilliams words

19432
05:16:02,060 --> 05:16:03,360
and strong objections

19433
05:16:03,360 --> 05:16:04,500
probably were.

19434
05:16:04,500 --> 05:16:05,640
Her having one uncle

19435
05:16:05,640 --> 05:16:05,960
who was a

19436
05:16:05,960 --> 05:16:07,040
country attorney

19437
05:16:07,040 --> 05:16:07,620
and another

19438
05:16:07,620 --> 05:16:08,400
who was in business

19439
05:16:08,400 --> 05:16:09,600
in London.

19440
05:16:10,560 --> 05:16:11,120
To Jane

19441
05:16:11,120 --> 05:16:12,320
herself, she.

19442
05:16:13,140 --> 05:16:13,560
There could be

19443
05:16:13,560 --> 05:16:14,580
no possibility

19444
05:16:14,580 --> 05:16:15,600
of objection.

19445
05:16:15,600 --> 05:16:16,440
All loveliness

19446
05:16:16,440 --> 05:16:17,700
and goodness, as she is

19447
05:16:18,020 --> 05:16:18,920
her understanding.

19448
05:16:18,920 --> 05:16:19,520
Excellent.

19449
05:16:19,520 --> 05:16:20,720
Her mind improved

19450
05:16:20,780 --> 05:16:21,060
and her

19451
05:16:21,060 --> 05:16:22,280
manners captivating.

19452
05:16:22,820 --> 05:16:23,760
Neither could anything

19453
05:16:23,760 --> 05:16:24,240
be urged

19454
05:16:24,240 --> 05:16:25,440
against my father,

19455
05:16:25,620 --> 05:16:26,000
who, though

19456
05:16:26,000 --> 05:16:27,240
with some peculiarities,

19457
05:16:27,240 --> 05:16:28,140
has abilities. Mr.

19458
05:16:28,140 --> 05:16:28,940
Darcy himself

19459
05:16:28,940 --> 05:16:30,140
need not disdain

19460
05:16:30,180 --> 05:16:31,140
and respectability,

19461
05:16:31,140 --> 05:16:31,520
which he will

19462
05:16:31,520 --> 05:16:32,720
probably never reach.

19463
05:16:33,480 --> 05:16:34,040
When she thought

19464
05:16:34,040 --> 05:16:34,880
of her mother,

19465
05:16:34,880 --> 05:16:35,660
her confidence

19466
05:16:35,660 --> 05:16:36,780
gave way a little.

19467
05:16:36,780 --> 05:16:37,220
But she would

19468
05:16:37,220 --> 05:16:37,820
not allow that.

19469
05:16:37,820 --> 05:16:38,600
Any objections?

19470
05:16:38,600 --> 05:16:39,120
There had

19471
05:16:39,120 --> 05:16:40,140
material weight with Mr.

19472
05:16:40,140 --> 05:16:40,880
Darcy,

19473
05:16:40,880 --> 05:16:41,640
whose pride

19474
05:16:41,640 --> 05:16:42,600
she was convinced

19475
05:16:42,600 --> 05:16:43,140
would receive

19476
05:16:43,140 --> 05:16:43,860
a deeper wound

19477
05:16:43,860 --> 05:16:44,360
from the want

19478
05:16:44,360 --> 05:16:45,020
of importance

19479
05:16:45,020 --> 05:16:45,260
in his

19480
05:16:45,260 --> 05:16:46,440
friend's connections

19481
05:16:46,440 --> 05:16:46,800
than from

19482
05:16:46,800 --> 05:16:48,000
their want of sense.

19483
05:16:48,020 --> 05:16:48,800
And she was quite.

19484
05:16:48,800 --> 05:16:49,880
Decided at last

19485
05:16:49,880 --> 05:16:50,400
that he had been

19486
05:16:50,400 --> 05:16:51,180
partly governed

19487
05:16:51,180 --> 05:16:52,800
by this kind of pride

19488
05:16:53,060 --> 05:16:53,640
and partly

19489
05:16:53,640 --> 05:16:54,140
by the wish

19490
05:16:54,140 --> 05:16:54,920
of retaining Mr.

19491
05:16:54,920 --> 05:16:56,120
Bingley for his sister.

19492
05:16:56,720 --> 05:16:58,220
The agitation and tears

19493
05:16:58,220 --> 05:16:58,880
which the subject

19494
05:16:58,880 --> 05:16:59,640
occasioned

19495
05:16:59,640 --> 05:17:00,780
brought on a headache

19496
05:17:00,780 --> 05:17:01,260
and it grew

19497
05:17:01,260 --> 05:17:01,940
so much worse

19498
05:17:01,940 --> 05:17:03,120
towards the evening.

19499
05:17:03,120 --> 05:17:03,780
That added

19500
05:17:03,780 --> 05:17:04,620
to her unwillingness

19501
05:17:04,620 --> 05:17:05,160
to see Mr.

19502
05:17:05,160 --> 05:17:05,880
Darcy.

19503
05:17:05,880 --> 05:17:06,600
It determined her

19504
05:17:06,600 --> 05:17:07,340
not to attend her

19505
05:17:07,340 --> 05:17:08,540
cousin's terrorizing

19506
05:17:08,580 --> 05:17:09,440
where they were engaged

19507
05:17:09,440 --> 05:17:10,640
to drink tea.

19508
05:17:10,700 --> 05:17:11,040
Mrs.

19509
05:17:11,040 --> 05:17:11,660
Collins,

19510
05:17:11,660 --> 05:17:12,000
seeing that

19511
05:17:12,000 --> 05:17:13,200
she was really unwell,

19512
05:17:13,220 --> 05:17:14,600
did not press her to go

19513
05:17:14,600 --> 05:17:15,680
and as much as possible

19514
05:17:15,680 --> 05:17:16,520
prevented her husband

19515
05:17:16,520 --> 05:17:17,580
from pressing her.

19516
05:17:17,580 --> 05:17:18,020
But Mr.

19517
05:17:18,020 --> 05:17:18,560
Collins could

19518
05:17:18,560 --> 05:17:19,160
not conceal

19519
05:17:19,160 --> 05:17:19,860
his apprehension

19520
05:17:19,860 --> 05:17:20,660
of Lady Katharine's

19521
05:17:20,660 --> 05:17:21,860
being rather displeased

19522
05:17:21,960 --> 05:17:23,180
by her staying at home.

19523
05:17:25,040 --> 05:17:26,240
Chapter 34.

19524
05:17:27,420 --> 05:17:28,440
When they were gone,

19525
05:17:28,440 --> 05:17:29,120
Elizabeth,

19526
05:17:29,120 --> 05:17:29,900
as if intending

19527
05:17:29,900 --> 05:17:31,100
to exasperate herself

19528
05:17:31,100 --> 05:17:32,600
as much as possible, Mr.

19529
05:17:32,600 --> 05:17:33,840
Darcy. Chose.

19530
05:17:33,840 --> 05:17:34,680
For her employment

19531
05:17:34,680 --> 05:17:35,520
the examination

19532
05:17:35,520 --> 05:17:36,300
of all the letters

19533
05:17:36,300 --> 05:17:36,900
which Jane had

19534
05:17:36,900 --> 05:17:37,460
written to her

19535
05:17:37,460 --> 05:17:38,660
since her being in Kent.

19536
05:17:39,060 --> 05:17:39,720
They contained

19537
05:17:39,720 --> 05:17:40,920
no actual complaint,

19538
05:17:41,180 --> 05:17:42,600
nor was there revival

19539
05:17:42,600 --> 05:17:43,800
of past occurrences

19540
05:17:43,860 --> 05:17:44,900
or any communication

19541
05:17:44,900 --> 05:17:46,100
of present suffering.

19542
05:17:46,380 --> 05:17:47,340
But in all and in

19543
05:17:47,340 --> 05:17:47,940
almost every

19544
05:17:47,940 --> 05:17:49,160
line of each, there was

19545
05:17:49,160 --> 05:17:49,680
a want of

19546
05:17:49,680 --> 05:17:50,660
that cheerfulness which.

19547
05:17:50,660 --> 05:17:51,180
Had been used.

19548
05:17:51,180 --> 05:17:51,900
To characterize

19549
05:17:51,900 --> 05:17:52,800
her style.

19550
05:17:52,800 --> 05:17:53,300
And which.

19551
05:17:53,300 --> 05:17:53,760
Proceeding

19552
05:17:53,760 --> 05:17:54,500
from the serenity

19553
05:17:54,500 --> 05:17:54,920
of a mind

19554
05:17:54,920 --> 05:17:56,120
at ease with itself

19555
05:17:56,160 --> 05:17:57,300
and keenly disposed

19556
05:17:57,300 --> 05:17:57,740
towards

19557
05:17:57,740 --> 05:17:58,440
everyone,

19558
05:17:58,440 --> 05:17:59,360
had been scarcely

19559
05:17:59,360 --> 05:18:00,560
ever clouded.

19560
05:18:00,800 --> 05:18:02,000
Elizabeth noticed

19561
05:18:02,060 --> 05:18:02,940
sentence, conveying

19562
05:18:02,940 --> 05:18:04,160
the idea of uneasiness

19563
05:18:04,400 --> 05:18:05,240
with an attention

19564
05:18:05,240 --> 05:18:05,640
which it had

19565
05:18:05,640 --> 05:18:06,420
hardly received

19566
05:18:06,420 --> 05:18:07,620
on the first perusal.

19567
05:18:08,040 --> 05:18:08,360
Mr.

19568
05:18:08,360 --> 05:18:09,680
Darcy shameful boast

19569
05:18:09,680 --> 05:18:10,620
of what misery he'd

19570
05:18:10,620 --> 05:18:11,820
been able to inflict.

19571
05:18:11,880 --> 05:18:12,200
Gave.

19572
05:18:12,200 --> 05:18:12,780
Her a keener

19573
05:18:12,780 --> 05:18:13,280
sense of her

19574
05:18:13,280 --> 05:18:14,480
sister's sufferings.

19575
05:18:14,820 --> 05:18:16,040
It was some consolation

19576
05:18:16,040 --> 05:18:16,340
to think

19577
05:18:16,340 --> 05:18:17,400
that his visit to Rosing

19578
05:18:17,400 --> 05:18:18,000
was to end

19579
05:18:18,000 --> 05:18:18,320
on the day

19580
05:18:18,320 --> 05:18:19,400
after the next,

19581
05:18:19,400 --> 05:18:20,600
and a still greater

19582
05:18:20,700 --> 05:18:21,060
that in

19583
05:18:21,060 --> 05:18:22,260
less than a fortnight.

19584
05:18:22,340 --> 05:18:23,420
She should herself be

19585
05:18:23,420 --> 05:18:24,420
with Jane again.

19586
05:18:24,420 --> 05:18:24,660
And.

19587
05:18:24,660 --> 05:18:25,460
Unable to contribute

19588
05:18:25,460 --> 05:18:26,060
to the recovery

19589
05:18:26,060 --> 05:18:27,020
of her spirits.

19590
05:18:27,020 --> 05:18:28,160
By all the defection

19591
05:18:28,160 --> 05:18:29,040
could do.

19592
05:18:29,040 --> 05:18:29,640
She could not.

19593
05:18:29,640 --> 05:18:30,420
Think of Darcy's

19594
05:18:30,420 --> 05:18:31,100
leaving Kent

19595
05:18:31,100 --> 05:18:31,880
without remembering

19596
05:18:31,880 --> 05:18:32,520
that his cousin

19597
05:18:32,520 --> 05:18:33,600
was to go with him.

19598
05:18:33,600 --> 05:18:34,640
But Colonel Fitzwilliam

19599
05:18:34,640 --> 05:18:35,360
had made it clear

19600
05:18:35,360 --> 05:18:35,700
that he had

19601
05:18:35,700 --> 05:18:36,900
no intentions at all

19602
05:18:36,980 --> 05:18:38,300
and agreeable as he was.

19603
05:18:38,520 --> 05:18:39,080
She did not.

19604
05:18:39,080 --> 05:18:39,500
Mean to be

19605
05:18:39,500 --> 05:18:40,700
unhappy about him.

19606
05:18:41,100 --> 05:18:42,320
While this point,

19607
05:18:42,540 --> 05:18:43,580
she was suddenly roused

19608
05:18:43,580 --> 05:18:44,060
by the sound

19609
05:18:44,060 --> 05:18:44,940
of the doorbell

19610
05:18:44,940 --> 05:18:45,680
and her spirits

19611
05:18:45,680 --> 05:18:46,500
were a little flattered

19612
05:18:46,500 --> 05:18:47,040
by the idea

19613
05:18:47,040 --> 05:18:47,540
of its being.

19614
05:18:47,540 --> 05:18:47,840
Colonel

19615
05:18:47,840 --> 05:18:49,040
Fitzwilliam himself.

19616
05:18:49,100 --> 05:18:49,580
Who had once.

19617
05:18:49,580 --> 05:18:50,000
Before,

19618
05:18:50,000 --> 05:18:50,520
called late

19619
05:18:50,520 --> 05:18:51,320
in the evening

19620
05:18:51,320 --> 05:18:52,080
and might now

19621
05:18:52,080 --> 05:18:52,820
come to inquire,

19622
05:18:52,820 --> 05:18:54,020
particularly after her.

19623
05:18:54,480 --> 05:18:55,620
But the idea was soon

19624
05:18:55,620 --> 05:18:56,820
banished and her spirits

19625
05:18:56,820 --> 05:18:57,120
were very

19626
05:18:57,120 --> 05:18:58,320
differently affected,

19627
05:18:58,400 --> 05:18:59,000
when, to her

19628
05:18:59,000 --> 05:19:00,080
utter amazement,

19629
05:19:00,080 --> 05:19:01,220
she saw Mr.

19630
05:19:01,220 --> 05:19:02,420
walk into the room

19631
05:19:02,520 --> 05:19:03,540
in a hurried manner.

19632
05:19:03,540 --> 05:19:04,340
He immediately began

19633
05:19:04,340 --> 05:19:04,760
an inquiry

19634
05:19:04,760 --> 05:19:05,660
after her health

19635
05:19:05,660 --> 05:19:06,620
and putting his visit

19636
05:19:06,620 --> 05:19:07,440
to a wish of hearing

19637
05:19:07,440 --> 05:19:08,580
that she were better.

19638
05:19:08,580 --> 05:19:09,360
She answered him

19639
05:19:09,360 --> 05:19:10,560
with cold civility.

19640
05:19:11,100 --> 05:19:11,940
He sat down

19641
05:19:11,940 --> 05:19:13,080
for a few moments

19642
05:19:13,080 --> 05:19:14,280
and then getting up,

19643
05:19:14,280 --> 05:19:15,480
walked about the room.

19644
05:19:15,900 --> 05:19:17,300
Elizabeth was surprised,

19645
05:19:17,300 --> 05:19:18,500
but said not a word.

19646
05:19:18,920 --> 05:19:19,820
After a silence

19647
05:19:19,820 --> 05:19:20,880
of several minutes.

19648
05:19:20,880 --> 05:19:21,860
He came towards her

19649
05:19:21,860 --> 05:19:23,060
in an agitated manner

19650
05:19:23,280 --> 05:19:24,480
and thus began

19651
05:19:25,200 --> 05:19:25,820
in vain.

19652
05:19:25,820 --> 05:19:27,020
Have I struggled?

19653
05:19:27,320 --> 05:19:28,520
It will not do.

19654
05:19:29,060 --> 05:19:29,880
My feelings will

19655
05:19:29,880 --> 05:19:30,660
not be repressed.

19656
05:19:32,300 --> 05:19:32,940
You must allow

19657
05:19:32,940 --> 05:19:33,180
me to

19658
05:19:33,180 --> 05:19:34,560
tell you how ardently

19659
05:19:34,560 --> 05:19:35,960
I admire and love you.

19660
05:19:38,600 --> 05:19:39,900
Elizabeth's astonishment

19661
05:19:39,900 --> 05:19:41,220
was beyond expression.

19662
05:19:41,600 --> 05:19:42,600
She stared.

19663
05:19:42,600 --> 05:19:43,280
Colored.

19664
05:19:43,280 --> 05:19:43,980
Doubted.

19665
05:19:43,980 --> 05:19:45,180
And was silent.

19666
05:19:45,360 --> 05:19:46,280
This, he considered

19667
05:19:46,280 --> 05:19:47,480
sufficient encouragement

19668
05:19:47,600 --> 05:19:48,360
and the avowal

19669
05:19:48,360 --> 05:19:49,460
of all that he felt

19670
05:19:49,460 --> 05:19:50,540
and had long felt

19671
05:19:50,540 --> 05:19:51,740
for her immediately

19672
05:19:51,740 --> 05:19:52,580
followed.

19673
05:19:52,580 --> 05:19:53,780
He spoke well,

19674
05:19:53,780 --> 05:19:54,720
but there were feelings

19675
05:19:54,720 --> 05:19:55,400
besides those

19676
05:19:55,400 --> 05:19:55,880
at the heart

19677
05:19:55,880 --> 05:19:56,880
to be detailed

19678
05:19:56,880 --> 05:19:57,560
and was not

19679
05:19:57,560 --> 05:19:58,200
more eloquent

19680
05:19:58,200 --> 05:19:58,800
on the subject

19681
05:19:58,800 --> 05:19:59,540
of tenderness

19682
05:19:59,540 --> 05:20:00,740
than of pride.

19683
05:20:00,740 --> 05:20:01,820
His sense of her

19684
05:20:01,820 --> 05:20:03,260
inferiority of its

19685
05:20:03,260 --> 05:20:04,460
being a degradation

19686
05:20:04,700 --> 05:20:06,080
of the family obstacles

19687
05:20:06,080 --> 05:20:06,300
which had

19688
05:20:06,300 --> 05:20:07,140
always opposed.

19689
05:20:07,140 --> 05:20:08,100
Inclination.

19690
05:20:08,100 --> 05:20:08,820
Were dwelt on

19691
05:20:08,820 --> 05:20:09,500
with a warmth which.

19692
05:20:09,500 --> 05:20:10,040
Seemed due

19693
05:20:10,040 --> 05:20:10,880
to the consequence

19694
05:20:10,880 --> 05:20:11,840
he was wounding.

19695
05:20:11,840 --> 05:20:12,980
But was very unlikely

19696
05:20:12,980 --> 05:20:14,240
to recommend his suit

19697
05:20:14,940 --> 05:20:15,740
in spite of her

19698
05:20:15,740 --> 05:20:16,940
deeply rooted dislike.

19699
05:20:17,120 --> 05:20:17,840
She could not be.

19700
05:20:17,840 --> 05:20:18,420
Insensible

19701
05:20:18,420 --> 05:20:19,160
to the compliment

19702
05:20:19,160 --> 05:20:19,500
to such a

19703
05:20:19,500 --> 05:20:20,700
man's affection.

19704
05:20:20,700 --> 05:20:21,120
And though

19705
05:20:21,120 --> 05:20:21,780
her intentions

19706
05:20:21,780 --> 05:20:22,440
did not vary

19707
05:20:22,440 --> 05:20:23,420
for an instant,

19708
05:20:23,420 --> 05:20:24,620
she was at first sorry

19709
05:20:24,620 --> 05:20:25,160
for the pain

19710
05:20:25,160 --> 05:20:26,360
he was to receive

19711
05:20:26,480 --> 05:20:27,420
till roused

19712
05:20:27,420 --> 05:20:28,140
to resentment

19713
05:20:28,140 --> 05:20:28,400
by his

19714
05:20:28,400 --> 05:20:29,580
subsequent language.

19715
05:20:29,580 --> 05:20:30,180
She lost

19716
05:20:30,180 --> 05:20:30,960
all compassion

19717
05:20:30,960 --> 05:20:31,860
and anger.

19718
05:20:31,860 --> 05:20:32,760
She tried, however,

19719
05:20:32,760 --> 05:20:33,680
to compose herself

19720
05:20:33,680 --> 05:20:34,460
to answer him with.

19721
05:20:34,460 --> 05:20:35,460
Patience when.

19722
05:20:35,460 --> 05:20:36,420
He should have done.

19723
05:20:36,420 --> 05:20:37,160
He concluded

19724
05:20:37,160 --> 05:20:38,120
with representing to her

19725
05:20:38,120 --> 05:20:38,660
the strength of

19726
05:20:38,660 --> 05:20:39,600
that attachment.

19727
05:20:39,600 --> 05:20:40,020
Which.

19728
05:20:40,020 --> 05:20:40,500
In spite

19729
05:20:40,500 --> 05:20:41,700
of all his endeavors,

19730
05:20:41,700 --> 05:20:42,740
he had found impossible

19731
05:20:42,740 --> 05:20:43,580
to conquer,

19732
05:20:43,580 --> 05:20:44,480
and with expressing

19733
05:20:44,480 --> 05:20:44,900
his hope

19734
05:20:44,900 --> 05:20:45,200
that it would

19735
05:20:45,200 --> 05:20:46,160
now be rewarded,

19736
05:20:46,160 --> 05:20:46,940
her acceptance

19737
05:20:46,940 --> 05:20:48,120
of his hand.

19738
05:20:48,120 --> 05:20:49,560
As he said this, she.

19739
05:20:49,560 --> 05:20:50,120
Could easily

19740
05:20:50,120 --> 05:20:51,380
see that he had no doubt

19741
05:20:51,380 --> 05:20:52,580
of a favorable answer.

19742
05:20:52,880 --> 05:20:54,200
He spoke of apprehension

19743
05:20:54,200 --> 05:20:55,160
and anxiety.

19744
05:20:55,160 --> 05:20:55,500
But his.

19745
05:20:55,500 --> 05:20:56,520
Countenance expressed

19746
05:20:56,520 --> 05:20:57,720
real security.

19747
05:20:58,100 --> 05:20:59,120
Such a circumstance

19748
05:20:59,120 --> 05:20:59,520
could only

19749
05:20:59,520 --> 05:21:00,720
exasperate further.

19750
05:21:00,860 --> 05:21:01,880
And when he ceased,

19751
05:21:01,880 --> 05:21:02,660
the color rose

19752
05:21:02,660 --> 05:21:03,420
into her cheeks.

19753
05:21:03,420 --> 05:21:04,620
And she said.

19754
05:21:04,860 --> 05:21:05,700
In such cases

19755
05:21:05,700 --> 05:21:06,900
as it is,

19756
05:21:06,900 --> 05:21:07,400
I believe

19757
05:21:07,400 --> 05:21:08,240
the established mode

19758
05:21:08,240 --> 05:21:08,720
to express

19759
05:21:08,720 --> 05:21:09,720
a sense of obligation

19760
05:21:09,720 --> 05:21:09,900
for the

19761
05:21:09,900 --> 05:21:11,100
sentiments of out,

19762
05:21:11,100 --> 05:21:12,020
however unequally

19763
05:21:12,020 --> 05:21:13,220
they may be returned.

19764
05:21:13,460 --> 05:21:14,220
It is natural

19765
05:21:14,220 --> 05:21:14,900
that obligation

19766
05:21:14,900 --> 05:21:15,860
should be felt.

19767
05:21:15,860 --> 05:21:16,460
And if I could

19768
05:21:16,460 --> 05:21:17,400
feel gratitude,

19769
05:21:17,400 --> 05:21:18,600
I would now thank you.

19770
05:21:19,020 --> 05:21:20,220
But I cannot.

19771
05:21:20,340 --> 05:21:20,960
I have never.

19772
05:21:20,960 --> 05:21:21,440
Desired to.

19773
05:21:21,440 --> 05:21:22,280
A good opinion,

19774
05:21:22,280 --> 05:21:22,800
and you have

19775
05:21:22,800 --> 05:21:23,700
certainly bestowed

19776
05:21:23,700 --> 05:21:25,080
it most unwillingly.

19777
05:21:25,680 --> 05:21:26,280
I am sorry

19778
05:21:26,280 --> 05:21:26,900
to have occasioned

19779
05:21:26,900 --> 05:21:28,080
pain to anyone.

19780
05:21:28,080 --> 05:21:29,060
It has been most

19781
05:21:29,060 --> 05:21:29,880
unconsciously done,

19782
05:21:29,880 --> 05:21:30,480
however,

19783
05:21:30,480 --> 05:21:31,140
and I hope would be

19784
05:21:31,140 --> 05:21:32,340
of short duration.

19785
05:21:32,640 --> 05:21:33,180
The feelings

19786
05:21:33,180 --> 05:21:34,200
which you tell me

19787
05:21:34,200 --> 05:21:35,040
have long prevented

19788
05:21:35,040 --> 05:21:35,660
the acknowledgment

19789
05:21:35,660 --> 05:21:36,980
of your regard can have

19790
05:21:36,980 --> 05:21:37,740
little difficulty

19791
05:21:37,740 --> 05:21:38,480
in overcoming it.

19792
05:21:38,480 --> 05:21:39,980
After this explanation.

19793
05:21:40,740 --> 05:21:41,120
Mr.

19794
05:21:41,120 --> 05:21:42,180
Darcy, who was leaning

19795
05:21:42,180 --> 05:21:43,200
against the mantelpiece

19796
05:21:43,200 --> 05:21:43,800
with his eyes

19797
05:21:43,800 --> 05:21:45,000
fixed on her face,

19798
05:21:45,020 --> 05:21:45,500
seemed to

19799
05:21:45,500 --> 05:21:46,320
catch her words

19800
05:21:46,320 --> 05:21:47,480
with no less resentment

19801
05:21:47,480 --> 05:21:48,680
than surprise.

19802
05:21:48,780 --> 05:21:49,500
His complexion

19803
05:21:49,500 --> 05:21:50,840
became pale with anger,

19804
05:21:51,120 --> 05:21:51,900
and the disturbance

19805
05:21:51,900 --> 05:21:52,980
of his mind was visible

19806
05:21:52,980 --> 05:21:54,180
in every feature.

19807
05:21:54,320 --> 05:21:55,220
He was struggling,

19808
05:21:55,220 --> 05:21:55,820
the appearance

19809
05:21:55,820 --> 05:21:56,720
of composure

19810
05:21:56,720 --> 05:21:57,360
and would not

19811
05:21:57,360 --> 05:21:58,080
open his lips

19812
05:21:58,080 --> 05:21:58,980
till he believed himself

19813
05:21:58,980 --> 05:22:00,180
to have attained it.

19814
05:22:00,200 --> 05:22:01,040
The pause was

19815
05:22:01,040 --> 05:22:02,120
to Elizabeth's feelings.

19816
05:22:02,120 --> 05:22:03,140
Dreadful.

19817
05:22:03,140 --> 05:22:03,740
At length,

19818
05:22:03,740 --> 05:22:04,160
with the voice

19819
05:22:04,160 --> 05:22:04,620
of forced

19820
05:22:04,620 --> 05:22:05,820
calmness, he said.

19821
05:22:06,360 --> 05:22:06,920
And this is

19822
05:22:06,920 --> 05:22:07,700
all the reply,

19823
05:22:07,700 --> 05:22:08,460
which I am to have

19824
05:22:08,460 --> 05:22:09,720
the honor of expecting.

19825
05:22:11,640 --> 05:22:12,500
I might perhaps

19826
05:22:12,500 --> 05:22:13,700
wish to be informed.

19827
05:22:13,860 --> 05:22:15,260
Why, with so little

19828
05:22:15,260 --> 05:22:16,460
endeavor at civility,

19829
05:22:16,460 --> 05:22:17,660
I am thus rejected.

19830
05:22:18,200 --> 05:22:18,800
But it is of

19831
05:22:18,800 --> 05:22:20,000
small importance.

19832
05:22:20,840 --> 05:22:22,220
I might as well inquire,

19833
05:22:22,520 --> 05:22:24,000
replied she, why,

19834
05:22:24,000 --> 05:22:25,200
with so evident

19835
05:22:25,220 --> 05:22:25,780
of offending

19836
05:22:25,780 --> 05:22:26,460
and insulting the

19837
05:22:26,460 --> 05:22:27,320
you chose to tell me

19838
05:22:27,320 --> 05:22:28,040
that you liked me

19839
05:22:28,040 --> 05:22:28,940
against your will,

19840
05:22:28,940 --> 05:22:29,880
against your reason,

19841
05:22:29,880 --> 05:22:30,660
and even against

19842
05:22:30,660 --> 05:22:31,820
your character?

19843
05:22:31,820 --> 05:22:33,060
Was not this some excuse

19844
05:22:33,060 --> 05:22:33,860
for incivility?

19845
05:22:33,860 --> 05:22:35,060
If I was in?

19846
05:22:35,520 --> 05:22:35,940
But I have

19847
05:22:35,940 --> 05:22:37,140
other provocations.

19848
05:22:37,160 --> 05:22:37,760
You know,

19849
05:22:37,760 --> 05:22:38,600
I have

19850
05:22:38,600 --> 05:22:39,920
had not my feelings

19851
05:22:39,920 --> 05:22:41,120
decided against you?

19852
05:22:41,160 --> 05:22:41,760
Had they been

19853
05:22:41,760 --> 05:22:42,420
indifferent

19854
05:22:42,420 --> 05:22:42,780
or had

19855
05:22:42,780 --> 05:22:43,220
they even

19856
05:22:43,220 --> 05:22:44,240
been favorable?

19857
05:22:44,240 --> 05:22:44,900
Do you think that

19858
05:22:44,900 --> 05:22:45,980
any consideration would.

19859
05:22:45,980 --> 05:22:46,440
Tempt me

19860
05:22:46,440 --> 05:22:47,300
to accept the man

19861
05:22:47,300 --> 05:22:47,700
who has been.

19862
05:22:47,700 --> 05:22:48,060
The means

19863
05:22:48,060 --> 05:22:48,600
of ruining

19864
05:22:48,600 --> 05:22:49,700
perhaps forever,

19865
05:22:49,700 --> 05:22:50,400
the happiness

19866
05:22:50,400 --> 05:22:50,820
of the most

19867
05:22:50,820 --> 05:22:52,020
beloved sister,

19868
05:22:52,700 --> 05:22:53,480
as she pronounced.

19869
05:22:53,480 --> 05:22:54,620
These words, Mr.

19870
05:22:54,620 --> 05:22:55,860
Darcy changed color,

19871
05:22:56,100 --> 05:22:56,780
but the emotion

19872
05:22:56,780 --> 05:22:57,560
was short

19873
05:22:57,560 --> 05:22:58,260
and he listened

19874
05:22:58,260 --> 05:22:58,920
without attempting

19875
05:22:58,920 --> 05:22:59,660
to interrupt her

19876
05:22:59,660 --> 05:23:00,860
while she continued.

19877
05:23:01,200 --> 05:23:02,280
I have every reason

19878
05:23:02,280 --> 05:23:02,700
in the world

19879
05:23:02,700 --> 05:23:03,900
to think of you.

19880
05:23:03,920 --> 05:23:05,120
No motive can excuse

19881
05:23:05,120 --> 05:23:05,900
the unjust

19882
05:23:05,900 --> 05:23:07,040
and ungenerous part.

19883
05:23:07,040 --> 05:23:08,240
You acted there.

19884
05:23:08,300 --> 05:23:09,440
You dare not.

19885
05:23:09,440 --> 05:23:10,580
You cannot deny

19886
05:23:10,580 --> 05:23:11,100
that you have been

19887
05:23:11,100 --> 05:23:11,700
the principal,

19888
05:23:11,700 --> 05:23:12,680
if not the only means

19889
05:23:12,680 --> 05:23:13,440
of dividing them

19890
05:23:13,440 --> 05:23:14,820
each other and exposing

19891
05:23:14,820 --> 05:23:15,660
one to the center

19892
05:23:15,660 --> 05:23:16,100
of the world,

19893
05:23:16,100 --> 05:23:16,680
the caprice

19894
05:23:16,680 --> 05:23:17,720
and instability,

19895
05:23:17,720 --> 05:23:18,300
and the other

19896
05:23:18,300 --> 05:23:19,080
to its derision

19897
05:23:19,080 --> 05:23:20,280
for disappointed hopes

19898
05:23:20,420 --> 05:23:21,600
and involving them both

19899
05:23:21,600 --> 05:23:22,140
in misery of

19900
05:23:22,140 --> 05:23:23,360
the acute ist kind.

19901
05:23:24,240 --> 05:23:25,760
She paused and saw

19902
05:23:25,760 --> 05:23:26,180
with no

19903
05:23:26,180 --> 05:23:27,140
slight indignation

19904
05:23:27,140 --> 05:23:27,840
that he was listening

19905
05:23:27,840 --> 05:23:28,260
with an air

19906
05:23:28,260 --> 05:23:28,820
which proved him

19907
05:23:28,820 --> 05:23:29,780
wholly unmoved

19908
05:23:29,780 --> 05:23:30,180
by any

19909
05:23:30,180 --> 05:23:31,380
feeling of remorse.

19910
05:23:31,520 --> 05:23:32,540
He even looked at her

19911
05:23:32,540 --> 05:23:33,780
with a smile of affected

19912
05:23:33,780 --> 05:23:34,980
incredulity.

19913
05:23:35,240 --> 05:23:36,180
Can you deny that

19914
05:23:36,180 --> 05:23:37,160
you have done it?

19915
05:23:37,160 --> 05:23:38,360
She repeated

19916
05:23:38,460 --> 05:23:39,140
with assumed

19917
05:23:39,140 --> 05:23:39,840
tranquility.

19918
05:23:39,840 --> 05:23:41,040
He then replied.

19919
05:23:41,220 --> 05:23:42,180
I have no wish

19920
05:23:42,180 --> 05:23:42,900
of denying that

19921
05:23:42,900 --> 05:23:43,520
I did everything

19922
05:23:43,520 --> 05:23:44,360
in my power

19923
05:23:44,360 --> 05:23:45,620
to separate my friend

19924
05:23:45,620 --> 05:23:46,820
from your sister,

19925
05:23:46,920 --> 05:23:47,840
or that I rejoice

19926
05:23:47,840 --> 05:23:49,040
in my success

19927
05:23:49,280 --> 05:23:50,060
towards him.

19928
05:23:50,060 --> 05:23:50,640
I have been

19929
05:23:50,640 --> 05:23:51,240
kinder than

19930
05:23:51,240 --> 05:23:52,100
towards myself.

19931
05:23:54,000 --> 05:23:55,220
Elizabeth disdained the

19932
05:23:55,220 --> 05:23:56,240
appearance of noticing

19933
05:23:56,240 --> 05:23:57,440
this civil reflection.

19934
05:23:57,660 --> 05:23:58,340
But its meaning

19935
05:23:58,340 --> 05:23:59,300
did not escape.

19936
05:23:59,300 --> 05:24:00,120
Nor was it likely

19937
05:24:00,120 --> 05:24:01,320
to conciliate her.

19938
05:24:01,920 --> 05:24:02,700
But it is not

19939
05:24:02,700 --> 05:24:04,020
merely this affair,

19940
05:24:04,200 --> 05:24:05,280
she continued,

19941
05:24:05,280 --> 05:24:06,440
on which my dislike

19942
05:24:06,440 --> 05:24:07,580
is founded

19943
05:24:07,580 --> 05:24:08,480
long before it had.

19944
05:24:08,480 --> 05:24:09,480
Even taken place.

19945
05:24:09,480 --> 05:24:10,160
My opinion of

19946
05:24:10,160 --> 05:24:11,280
you was decided.

19947
05:24:11,280 --> 05:24:12,180
Your character

19948
05:24:12,180 --> 05:24:13,320
enfolded in the recital,

19949
05:24:13,320 --> 05:24:13,920
which I received

19950
05:24:13,920 --> 05:24:15,080
many months ago from Mr.

19951
05:24:15,080 --> 05:24:17,080
Wickham on this subject.

19952
05:24:17,100 --> 05:24:17,880
What can you

19953
05:24:17,880 --> 05:24:18,840
have to say?

19954
05:24:18,840 --> 05:24:20,040
In what imaginary

19955
05:24:20,040 --> 05:24:21,060
act of friendship

19956
05:24:21,060 --> 05:24:21,560
can you hear?

19957
05:24:21,560 --> 05:24:22,760
Defend yourself?

19958
05:24:22,880 --> 05:24:23,280
Or under

19959
05:24:23,280 --> 05:24:24,480
what misrepresentation

19960
05:24:24,480 --> 05:24:24,860
can you hear

19961
05:24:24,860 --> 05:24:26,060
impose upon others?

19962
05:24:27,120 --> 05:24:27,720
You take an

19963
05:24:27,720 --> 05:24:28,560
eager interest

19964
05:24:28,560 --> 05:24:29,280
in that gentleman's

19965
05:24:29,280 --> 05:24:30,480
concerns.

19966
05:24:30,540 --> 05:24:31,460
Said D'Arcy, in a less

19967
05:24:31,460 --> 05:24:32,180
tranquil tone

19968
05:24:32,180 --> 05:24:32,480
and with a

19969
05:24:32,480 --> 05:24:33,680
heightened color.

19970
05:24:34,560 --> 05:24:35,300
Who that knows

19971
05:24:35,300 --> 05:24:36,140
what his misfortunes

19972
05:24:36,140 --> 05:24:36,620
have been can.

19973
05:24:36,620 --> 05:24:37,280
Help feeling an

19974
05:24:37,280 --> 05:24:38,480
interest in him.

19975
05:24:38,700 --> 05:24:39,900
His misfortunes.

19976
05:24:40,280 --> 05:24:40,760
Repeated.

19977
05:24:40,760 --> 05:24:41,960
Darcy contemptuously.

19978
05:24:43,020 --> 05:24:44,100
Yes, His

19979
05:24:44,100 --> 05:24:45,060
misfortunes have

19980
05:24:45,060 --> 05:24:46,280
been great indeed.

19981
05:24:46,920 --> 05:24:48,540
And of your infliction?

19982
05:24:48,900 --> 05:24:49,700
Cried Elizabeth.

19983
05:24:49,700 --> 05:24:50,760
With energy.

19984
05:24:50,760 --> 05:24:51,860
You have reduced him

19985
05:24:51,860 --> 05:24:52,860
to his present state

19986
05:24:52,860 --> 05:24:53,700
of poverty.

19987
05:24:53,700 --> 05:24:54,960
Comparative poverty.

19988
05:24:55,280 --> 05:24:56,060
You have withheld

19989
05:24:56,060 --> 05:24:56,840
the advantages

19990
05:24:56,840 --> 05:24:57,660
which you must know

19991
05:24:57,660 --> 05:24:58,400
to have been designed

19992
05:24:58,400 --> 05:24:59,120
for him.

19993
05:24:59,120 --> 05:24:59,880
You have deprived

19994
05:24:59,880 --> 05:25:00,540
the best years

19995
05:25:00,540 --> 05:25:01,040
of his life.

19996
05:25:01,040 --> 05:25:01,880
That independ,

19997
05:25:01,880 --> 05:25:02,700
which was no less

19998
05:25:02,700 --> 05:25:03,900
his do than his dessert.

19999
05:25:04,160 --> 05:25:05,760
You have done all this,

20000
05:25:06,240 --> 05:25:07,400
and yet you can treat

20001
05:25:07,400 --> 05:25:07,880
the mention

20002
05:25:07,880 --> 05:25:08,720
of his misfortune

20003
05:25:08,720 --> 05:25:09,480
with contempt

20004
05:25:09,480 --> 05:25:10,680
and ridicule.

20005
05:25:11,180 --> 05:25:12,000
And this.

20006
05:25:12,000 --> 05:25:13,160
Cried Darcy.

20007
05:25:13,160 --> 05:25:13,380
As.

20008
05:25:13,380 --> 05:25:14,240
He walked with quick

20009
05:25:14,240 --> 05:25:15,440
steps across the room.

20010
05:25:15,780 --> 05:25:17,040
Is your opinion of me?

20011
05:25:17,940 --> 05:25:19,020
This is the estimation

20012
05:25:19,020 --> 05:25:20,220
in which you hold me.

20013
05:25:20,900 --> 05:25:21,500
I thank you

20014
05:25:21,500 --> 05:25:22,280
for explaining it

20015
05:25:22,280 --> 05:25:23,480
so fully.

20016
05:25:23,820 --> 05:25:24,540
My faults,

20017
05:25:24,540 --> 05:25:24,980
according to

20018
05:25:24,980 --> 05:25:25,760
this calculation,

20019
05:25:25,760 --> 05:25:26,960
are heavy indeed.

20020
05:25:27,840 --> 05:25:29,300
But perhaps added

20021
05:25:29,300 --> 05:25:30,540
he stopping in his walk

20022
05:25:30,540 --> 05:25:31,620
and turning towards her.

20023
05:25:32,900 --> 05:25:33,800
These offenses might

20024
05:25:33,800 --> 05:25:35,000
have been overlooked

20025
05:25:36,240 --> 05:25:37,040
had not your pride

20026
05:25:37,040 --> 05:25:38,240
been hurt by my honest

20027
05:25:38,240 --> 05:25:38,780
confession

20028
05:25:38,780 --> 05:25:39,500
of the scruples

20029
05:25:39,500 --> 05:25:40,040
that had long

20030
05:25:40,040 --> 05:25:41,300
prevented my any

20031
05:25:41,300 --> 05:25:42,500
serious design?

20032
05:25:43,580 --> 05:25:44,840
These bitter accusations

20033
05:25:44,840 --> 05:25:45,120
might have

20034
05:25:45,120 --> 05:25:46,320
been suppressed

20035
05:25:46,320 --> 05:25:46,700
had I,

20036
05:25:46,700 --> 05:25:47,900
with greater policy,

20037
05:25:48,440 --> 05:25:49,680
concealed my struggles

20038
05:25:50,040 --> 05:25:50,840
and flattered

20039
05:25:50,840 --> 05:25:51,500
into the belief

20040
05:25:51,500 --> 05:25:52,500
of my being impelled

20041
05:25:52,500 --> 05:25:53,700
by unqualified,

20042
05:25:53,820 --> 05:25:55,040
unalloyed inclination,

20043
05:25:55,580 --> 05:25:56,240
by reason,

20044
05:25:56,240 --> 05:25:56,900
by reflection,

20045
05:25:56,900 --> 05:25:58,100
by everything

20046
05:25:59,120 --> 05:26:00,080
but disguise of

20047
05:26:00,080 --> 05:26:00,620
every sort

20048
05:26:00,620 --> 05:26:01,820
is my abhorrence.

20049
05:26:02,520 --> 05:26:03,380
Nor am I ashamed

20050
05:26:03,380 --> 05:26:03,900
of the feelings

20051
05:26:03,900 --> 05:26:05,100
I related.

20052
05:26:05,300 --> 05:26:05,960
They were natural

20053
05:26:05,960 --> 05:26:07,160
and just.

20054
05:26:08,400 --> 05:26:09,140
Could you expect me

20055
05:26:09,140 --> 05:26:09,720
to rejoice

20056
05:26:09,720 --> 05:26:10,700
in the inferiority

20057
05:26:10,700 --> 05:26:11,900
of your connections?

20058
05:26:12,860 --> 05:26:14,160
To congratulate myself

20059
05:26:14,160 --> 05:26:15,240
on the hope of relations

20060
05:26:15,240 --> 05:26:16,440
whose condition in life

20061
05:26:17,120 --> 05:26:18,060
is so decidedly

20062
05:26:18,060 --> 05:26:19,260
beneath my own?

20063
05:26:20,460 --> 05:26:21,560
Elizabeth Felt herself

20064
05:26:21,560 --> 05:26:22,460
growing more angry

20065
05:26:22,460 --> 05:26:23,400
every moment.

20066
05:26:23,400 --> 05:26:24,380
Yet she tried to

20067
05:26:24,380 --> 05:26:24,980
the utmost

20068
05:26:24,980 --> 05:26:26,000
to speak with composure

20069
05:26:26,000 --> 05:26:27,200
when she said.

20070
05:26:27,540 --> 05:26:28,640
You are mistaken, Mr.

20071
05:26:28,640 --> 05:26:29,360
Darcy.

20072
05:26:29,360 --> 05:26:30,240
If you suppose that

20073
05:26:30,240 --> 05:26:30,540
the mood

20074
05:26:30,540 --> 05:26:31,280
of your declaration

20075
05:26:31,280 --> 05:26:31,700
affected.

20076
05:26:31,700 --> 05:26:32,900
Me in any other way.

20077
05:26:33,000 --> 05:26:34,080
Then as it spared

20078
05:26:34,080 --> 05:26:34,760
the concern

20079
05:26:34,760 --> 05:26:35,360
which I might have

20080
05:26:35,360 --> 05:26:36,560
felt in refusing you,

20081
05:26:36,780 --> 05:26:37,880
had you behaved in a

20082
05:26:37,880 --> 05:26:38,600
more gentleman.

20083
05:26:38,600 --> 05:26:39,320
Like manner.

20084
05:26:40,340 --> 05:26:40,800
She saw

20085
05:26:40,800 --> 05:26:42,000
him start at this.

20086
05:26:42,060 --> 05:26:43,220
But he said nothing.

20087
05:26:43,220 --> 05:26:44,420
And she continued.

20088
05:26:44,760 --> 05:26:45,740
You could not have made

20089
05:26:45,740 --> 05:26:46,620
the offer of your hand

20090
05:26:46,620 --> 05:26:47,460
in any possible.

20091
05:26:47,460 --> 05:26:47,880
Way that would

20092
05:26:47,880 --> 05:26:48,500
have tempted me

20093
05:26:48,500 --> 05:26:49,700
to accept it

20094
05:26:50,180 --> 05:26:50,640
again.

20095
05:26:50,640 --> 05:26:51,380
His astonishment

20096
05:26:51,380 --> 05:26:52,280
was obvious,

20097
05:26:52,280 --> 05:26:53,000
and he looked at her

20098
05:26:53,000 --> 05:26:53,660
with an expression

20099
05:26:53,660 --> 05:26:54,900
of mingled incredulity

20100
05:26:54,900 --> 05:26:56,100
and mortification.

20101
05:26:56,100 --> 05:26:57,300
She went on

20102
05:26:57,560 --> 05:26:58,760
from the very beginning,

20103
05:26:58,860 --> 05:26:59,960
from the first moment

20104
05:26:59,960 --> 05:27:00,840
I may almost say,

20105
05:27:00,840 --> 05:27:01,520
of my acquaintance

20106
05:27:01,520 --> 05:27:02,160
with you,

20107
05:27:02,160 --> 05:27:02,900
your manners

20108
05:27:02,900 --> 05:27:03,600
impressing me

20109
05:27:03,600 --> 05:27:04,440
with the fullest belief

20110
05:27:04,440 --> 05:27:05,220
of your arrogance,

20111
05:27:05,220 --> 05:27:06,020
your conceit,

20112
05:27:06,020 --> 05:27:07,340
and your selfish disdain

20113
05:27:07,340 --> 05:27:07,880
for the feelings

20114
05:27:07,880 --> 05:27:08,600
of others.

20115
05:27:08,600 --> 05:27:09,600
Was that just a form

20116
05:27:09,600 --> 05:27:10,200
the groundwork

20117
05:27:10,200 --> 05:27:11,580
of disapprobation on

20118
05:27:11,580 --> 05:27:12,200
which succeeding

20119
05:27:12,200 --> 05:27:12,900
events have built

20120
05:27:12,900 --> 05:27:14,120
so immovable to dislike?

20121
05:27:14,480 --> 05:27:15,800
And I had not known you

20122
05:27:15,800 --> 05:27:16,700
a month before.

20123
05:27:16,700 --> 05:27:17,360
I felt that you were

20124
05:27:17,360 --> 05:27:18,200
the last man

20125
05:27:18,200 --> 05:27:19,460
in the world whom I ever

20126
05:27:19,460 --> 05:27:20,040
be prevailed

20127
05:27:20,040 --> 05:27:20,720
on to marry.

20128
05:27:21,740 --> 05:27:22,260
You have said

20129
05:27:22,260 --> 05:27:23,460
quite enough, Madam.

20130
05:27:23,660 --> 05:27:24,840
I perfectly comprehend

20131
05:27:24,840 --> 05:27:25,920
your feelings

20132
05:27:25,920 --> 05:27:26,420
and have now

20133
05:27:26,420 --> 05:27:27,420
only to be ashamed

20134
05:27:27,420 --> 05:27:28,040
of what my own

20135
05:27:28,040 --> 05:27:29,240
have been.

20136
05:27:29,340 --> 05:27:29,840
Forgive me

20137
05:27:29,840 --> 05:27:30,240
for having

20138
05:27:30,240 --> 05:27:30,660
taken up

20139
05:27:30,660 --> 05:27:31,620
so much of your time

20140
05:27:31,620 --> 05:27:32,660
and accept

20141
05:27:32,660 --> 05:27:33,540
my best wishes

20142
05:27:33,540 --> 05:27:34,040
for your health

20143
05:27:34,040 --> 05:27:35,240
and happiness.

20144
05:27:35,460 --> 05:27:36,500
And with these words,

20145
05:27:36,500 --> 05:27:37,760
he hastily left the room

20146
05:27:38,060 --> 05:27:39,060
and heard him.

20147
05:27:39,060 --> 05:27:39,740
The next moment,

20148
05:27:39,740 --> 05:27:40,680
open the French door

20149
05:27:40,680 --> 05:27:41,880
and quit the house.

20150
05:27:42,440 --> 05:27:43,100
The tumult of.

20151
05:27:43,100 --> 05:27:43,820
Her mind was now

20152
05:27:43,820 --> 05:27:45,020
painfully great.

20153
05:27:45,200 --> 05:27:45,600
She knew

20154
05:27:45,600 --> 05:27:46,460
not how to support.

20155
05:27:46,460 --> 05:27:47,160
Herself

20156
05:27:47,160 --> 05:27:47,480
and from

20157
05:27:47,480 --> 05:27:48,560
actual weakness,

20158
05:27:48,560 --> 05:27:49,160
sat down

20159
05:27:49,160 --> 05:27:49,740
and cried

20160
05:27:49,740 --> 05:27:50,940
for half an hour.

20161
05:27:51,060 --> 05:27:51,920
Her astonishment,

20162
05:27:51,920 --> 05:27:52,580
as she reflected.

20163
05:27:52,580 --> 05:27:53,580
On what had passed

20164
05:27:53,580 --> 05:27:54,320
was increased.

20165
05:27:54,320 --> 05:27:55,040
By every review.

20166
05:27:55,040 --> 05:27:55,760
Of it

20167
05:27:55,760 --> 05:27:56,640
that she should receive.

20168
05:27:56,640 --> 05:27:57,680
An offer of marriage

20169
05:27:57,680 --> 05:27:58,100
from Mr.

20170
05:27:58,100 --> 05:27:58,980
Darcy.

20171
05:27:58,980 --> 05:27:59,480
But he should

20172
05:27:59,480 --> 05:28:00,080
have been in love

20173
05:28:00,080 --> 05:28:00,360
with her

20174
05:28:00,360 --> 05:28:01,560
for so many months.

20175
05:28:01,640 --> 05:28:02,540
So much in love

20176
05:28:02,540 --> 05:28:03,540
as to wish to marry her

20177
05:28:03,540 --> 05:28:03,860
in spite

20178
05:28:03,860 --> 05:28:04,860
of all the objections

20179
05:28:04,860 --> 05:28:05,360
which had made him

20180
05:28:05,360 --> 05:28:06,120
prevent his friends

20181
05:28:06,120 --> 05:28:07,320
marrying her sister,

20182
05:28:07,460 --> 05:28:08,120
which must appear

20183
05:28:08,120 --> 05:28:08,660
at least

20184
05:28:08,660 --> 05:28:09,540
equal force in his.

20185
05:28:09,540 --> 05:28:10,920
Own case was almost.

20186
05:28:10,920 --> 05:28:12,120
Incredible.

20187
05:28:12,120 --> 05:28:13,040
It was gratifying

20188
05:28:13,040 --> 05:28:13,680
to have inspired

20189
05:28:13,680 --> 05:28:14,400
unconsciously so

20190
05:28:14,400 --> 05:28:15,600
strong in affection.

20191
05:28:15,800 --> 05:28:16,140
But his.

20192
05:28:16,140 --> 05:28:17,160
Pride. His.

20193
05:28:17,160 --> 05:28:18,360
Abominable pride,

20194
05:28:18,540 --> 05:28:19,860
his shameless avowal

20195
05:28:19,860 --> 05:28:20,540
of what he had done

20196
05:28:20,540 --> 05:28:21,740
with respect to Jane,

20197
05:28:21,900 --> 05:28:22,880
his unpardonable

20198
05:28:22,880 --> 05:28:23,360
assurance

20199
05:28:23,360 --> 05:28:24,320
and acknowledging,

20200
05:28:24,320 --> 05:28:24,500
though

20201
05:28:24,500 --> 05:28:25,700
he could not justify it,

20202
05:28:25,760 --> 05:28:26,940
and the unfeeling manner

20203
05:28:26,940 --> 05:28:27,240
in which.

20204
05:28:27,240 --> 05:28:27,920
He had mentioned Mr.

20205
05:28:27,920 --> 05:28:29,160
Wickham, his cruelty.

20206
05:28:29,160 --> 05:28:30,060
Towards whom he had not.

20207
05:28:30,060 --> 05:28:31,260
Attempted to deny.

20208
05:28:31,320 --> 05:28:32,540
Soon overcame the pity,

20209
05:28:32,540 --> 05:28:33,420
which the consideration

20210
05:28:33,420 --> 05:28:34,140
of his attachment

20211
05:28:34,140 --> 05:28:34,520
had for a

20212
05:28:34,520 --> 05:28:35,720
moment excited.

20213
05:28:35,880 --> 05:28:36,840
She continued in very

20214
05:28:36,840 --> 05:28:38,040
agitated reflections,

20215
05:28:38,180 --> 05:28:39,060
till the sound of Lady

20216
05:28:39,060 --> 05:28:39,920
Katherine's carriage

20217
05:28:39,920 --> 05:28:40,400
made her feel

20218
05:28:40,400 --> 05:28:41,360
how unequal she was

20219
05:28:41,360 --> 05:28:41,840
to encounter

20220
05:28:41,840 --> 05:28:43,040
Charlotte's observation

20221
05:28:43,220 --> 05:28:43,740
and hurried

20222
05:28:43,740 --> 05:28:44,840
her way to her room.

20223
05:28:47,720 --> 05:28:49,020
Chapter 35

20224
05:28:51,480 --> 05:28:52,280
Elizabeth awoke

20225
05:28:52,280 --> 05:28:52,980
the next morning

20226
05:28:52,980 --> 05:28:53,940
to the same thoughts

20227
05:28:53,940 --> 05:28:54,780
and meditations

20228
05:28:54,780 --> 05:28:55,500
which had at length,

20229
05:28:55,500 --> 05:28:56,700
closed her eyes.

20230
05:28:58,880 --> 05:28:59,460
She could not

20231
05:28:59,460 --> 05:29:00,120
yet recover

20232
05:29:00,120 --> 05:29:00,960
from the surprise

20233
05:29:00,960 --> 05:29:02,160
of what had happened.

20234
05:29:02,960 --> 05:29:03,840
It was impossible

20235
05:29:03,840 --> 05:29:04,380
to think of

20236
05:29:04,380 --> 05:29:05,580
anything else

20237
05:29:05,580 --> 05:29:06,380
and totally

20238
05:29:06,380 --> 05:29:06,960
indisposed

20239
05:29:06,960 --> 05:29:07,820
for employment.

20240
05:29:07,820 --> 05:29:09,120
She Resolved soon

20241
05:29:09,120 --> 05:29:09,900
after breakfast

20242
05:29:09,900 --> 05:29:10,760
to indulge herself

20243
05:29:10,760 --> 05:29:12,080
in air and exercise.

20244
05:29:13,980 --> 05:29:14,780
She was proceeding

20245
05:29:14,780 --> 05:29:15,240
directly

20246
05:29:15,240 --> 05:29:16,440
to her favorite walk

20247
05:29:16,640 --> 05:29:17,580
when the recollection

20248
05:29:17,580 --> 05:29:17,960
of Mr.

20249
05:29:17,960 --> 05:29:19,340
Darcy sometimes coming

20250
05:29:19,340 --> 05:29:20,540
there stopped her.

20251
05:29:21,300 --> 05:29:22,220
And instead of entering

20252
05:29:22,220 --> 05:29:22,820
the park,

20253
05:29:22,820 --> 05:29:23,960
she turned up the lane,

20254
05:29:23,960 --> 05:29:24,860
which led her farther

20255
05:29:24,860 --> 05:29:26,060
from the turnpike road.

20256
05:29:27,320 --> 05:29:27,800
The park

20257
05:29:27,800 --> 05:29:28,800
paling was still

20258
05:29:28,800 --> 05:29:29,300
the boundary

20259
05:29:29,300 --> 05:29:30,480
on one side,

20260
05:29:30,480 --> 05:29:31,520
and she soon passed

20261
05:29:31,520 --> 05:29:32,300
one of the gates

20262
05:29:32,300 --> 05:29:33,500
into the ground.

20263
05:29:34,740 --> 05:29:35,100
After

20264
05:29:35,100 --> 05:29:35,700
walking two

20265
05:29:35,700 --> 05:29:36,420
or three times

20266
05:29:36,420 --> 05:29:36,840
along that

20267
05:29:36,840 --> 05:29:38,040
part of the lane,

20268
05:29:38,060 --> 05:29:39,020
she was tempted

20269
05:29:39,020 --> 05:29:39,840
by the pleasantness

20270
05:29:39,840 --> 05:29:40,580
of the morning

20271
05:29:40,580 --> 05:29:41,660
to stop at the gates

20272
05:29:41,660 --> 05:29:42,860
and look into the park.

20273
05:29:43,460 --> 05:29:44,280
The five weeks

20274
05:29:44,280 --> 05:29:44,900
which she had now

20275
05:29:44,900 --> 05:29:46,100
passed in Kent

20276
05:29:46,680 --> 05:29:47,720
had made a great

20277
05:29:47,720 --> 05:29:48,920
in the country,

20278
05:29:49,220 --> 05:29:49,880
and every day

20279
05:29:49,880 --> 05:29:50,520
was adding to the

20280
05:29:50,520 --> 05:29:51,080
verdure of the

20281
05:29:51,080 --> 05:29:51,800
early trees.

20282
05:29:52,880 --> 05:29:53,720
She was on the point

20283
05:29:53,720 --> 05:29:54,920
of continuing her walk

20284
05:29:55,140 --> 05:29:55,700
when she caught

20285
05:29:55,700 --> 05:29:56,120
a glimpse

20286
05:29:56,120 --> 05:29:57,180
of a gentleman within

20287
05:29:57,180 --> 05:29:58,080
sort of grove,

20288
05:29:58,080 --> 05:29:59,280
which edged the park.

20289
05:29:59,700 --> 05:30:00,900
He was moving that way

20290
05:30:01,740 --> 05:30:02,400
and fearful

20291
05:30:02,400 --> 05:30:03,240
of its being. Mr.

20292
05:30:03,240 --> 05:30:04,100
Darcy,

20293
05:30:04,100 --> 05:30:04,440
she was

20294
05:30:04,440 --> 05:30:05,640
directly retreating,

20295
05:30:06,440 --> 05:30:08,000
but person who advanced

20296
05:30:08,000 --> 05:30:08,400
was now

20297
05:30:08,400 --> 05:30:09,600
near enough to see her

20298
05:30:09,900 --> 05:30:10,860
and stepping forward

20299
05:30:10,860 --> 05:30:11,720
with eagerness,

20300
05:30:11,720 --> 05:30:12,920
pronounced her name.

20301
05:30:13,320 --> 05:30:14,520
She had turned away,

20302
05:30:14,660 --> 05:30:15,800
but on hearing herself,

20303
05:30:15,800 --> 05:30:17,540
called though in a voice

20304
05:30:17,540 --> 05:30:18,240
which proved it

20305
05:30:18,240 --> 05:30:18,780
to be Mr.

20306
05:30:18,780 --> 05:30:20,580
Darcy, she moved again

20307
05:30:20,580 --> 05:30:21,780
towards the gate.

20308
05:30:21,780 --> 05:30:22,820
He had by that time

20309
05:30:22,820 --> 05:30:24,020
reached it also

20310
05:30:24,260 --> 05:30:25,520
and holding out a letter

20311
05:30:25,860 --> 05:30:27,080
which instinctively

20312
05:30:27,080 --> 05:30:28,280
took said

20313
05:30:28,640 --> 05:30:29,640
with a look of haughty

20314
05:30:29,640 --> 05:30:30,840
composure.

20315
05:30:31,380 --> 05:30:31,940
I have been

20316
05:30:31,940 --> 05:30:32,760
walking in the grove

20317
05:30:32,760 --> 05:30:33,320
some time

20318
05:30:33,320 --> 05:30:33,800
in the hope of

20319
05:30:33,800 --> 05:30:35,000
meeting you.

20320
05:30:35,000 --> 05:30:35,700
Will you do me

20321
05:30:35,700 --> 05:30:36,320
the of

20322
05:30:36,320 --> 05:30:37,520
reading that letter?

20323
05:30:37,760 --> 05:30:38,640
And then, with a slight

20324
05:30:38,640 --> 05:30:40,020
bow turned again

20325
05:30:40,020 --> 05:30:41,220
into the plantation

20326
05:30:41,400 --> 05:30:42,300
and was soon out

20327
05:30:42,300 --> 05:30:42,840
of sight,

20328
05:30:44,180 --> 05:30:44,660
with no

20329
05:30:44,660 --> 05:30:45,920
expectation of pleasure,

20330
05:30:46,220 --> 05:30:46,640
but with the

20331
05:30:46,640 --> 05:30:48,000
strongest curiosity.

20332
05:30:48,320 --> 05:30:49,260
Elizabeth opened

20333
05:30:49,260 --> 05:30:50,660
the letter and to her

20334
05:30:50,660 --> 05:30:51,860
still increasing wonder,

20335
05:30:51,860 --> 05:30:52,320
perceived

20336
05:30:52,320 --> 05:30:52,820
an envelope

20337
05:30:52,820 --> 05:30:53,300
containing

20338
05:30:53,300 --> 05:30:53,840
two sheets

20339
05:30:53,840 --> 05:30:55,260
of letter paper written

20340
05:30:55,260 --> 05:30:55,880
quite through

20341
05:30:55,880 --> 05:30:57,080
in a very close hand.

20342
05:30:58,700 --> 05:30:59,880
The envelope itself

20343
05:30:59,880 --> 05:31:01,080
was likewise full.

20344
05:31:02,180 --> 05:31:03,120
Pursuing her way

20345
05:31:03,120 --> 05:31:03,900
along the lane,

20346
05:31:03,900 --> 05:31:05,100
she then began it.

20347
05:31:06,140 --> 05:31:07,560
It was dated from Rosing

20348
05:31:07,880 --> 05:31:09,080
at 8:00 in the morning

20349
05:31:09,080 --> 05:31:10,380
and was as follows.

20350
05:31:11,540 --> 05:31:12,360
Be not alarmed,

20351
05:31:12,360 --> 05:31:13,280
madam, on receiving

20352
05:31:13,280 --> 05:31:14,480
this letter

20353
05:31:14,760 --> 05:31:15,900
by, the apprehension

20354
05:31:15,900 --> 05:31:16,160
of its

20355
05:31:16,160 --> 05:31:16,700
containing

20356
05:31:16,700 --> 05:31:17,480
any repetition

20357
05:31:17,480 --> 05:31:18,680
of those sentiments

20358
05:31:18,800 --> 05:31:19,440
or renewal

20359
05:31:19,440 --> 05:31:20,180
of those offers

20360
05:31:20,180 --> 05:31:21,080
which were last night

20361
05:31:21,080 --> 05:31:22,400
so disgusting to you.

20362
05:31:23,340 --> 05:31:23,840
I write

20363
05:31:23,840 --> 05:31:25,040
without any intention

20364
05:31:25,040 --> 05:31:25,680
painting you

20365
05:31:25,680 --> 05:31:26,900
or humbling myself

20366
05:31:26,900 --> 05:31:28,100
by dwelling on wishes,

20367
05:31:28,400 --> 05:31:28,980
which for the

20368
05:31:28,980 --> 05:31:30,180
happiness of both,

20369
05:31:30,420 --> 05:31:31,340
cannot be too soon

20370
05:31:31,340 --> 05:31:32,540
forgotten,

20371
05:31:33,240 --> 05:31:33,980
and the effort

20372
05:31:33,980 --> 05:31:35,180
which the formation,

20373
05:31:35,240 --> 05:31:35,880
the perusal

20374
05:31:35,880 --> 05:31:36,540
of this letter

20375
05:31:36,540 --> 05:31:37,260
must occasion

20376
05:31:37,260 --> 05:31:38,460
should have been spared,

20377
05:31:38,640 --> 05:31:39,740
had not my character

20378
05:31:39,740 --> 05:31:40,340
required it

20379
05:31:40,340 --> 05:31:41,420
to be written and read.

20380
05:31:42,960 --> 05:31:43,760
You must therefore

20381
05:31:43,760 --> 05:31:44,960
pardon the freedom with.

20382
05:31:45,060 --> 05:31:46,260
I demand your attention.

20383
05:31:47,220 --> 05:31:48,000
Your feelings

20384
05:31:48,000 --> 05:31:48,380
I know

20385
05:31:48,380 --> 05:31:48,660
will be

20386
05:31:48,660 --> 05:31:49,860
studied unwillingly,

20387
05:31:50,300 --> 05:31:51,120
but I demand it

20388
05:31:51,120 --> 05:31:52,320
of your justice.

20389
05:31:53,400 --> 05:31:54,260
Two offenses

20390
05:31:54,260 --> 05:31:54,720
of a very

20391
05:31:54,720 --> 05:31:55,920
different nature

20392
05:31:55,920 --> 05:31:56,300
and by

20393
05:31:56,300 --> 05:31:56,780
no means of

20394
05:31:56,780 --> 05:31:57,980
equal magnitude.

20395
05:31:58,740 --> 05:31:59,540
You last night

20396
05:31:59,540 --> 05:32:00,740
laid to my charge.

20397
05:32:01,500 --> 05:32:02,360
The first mentioned

20398
05:32:02,360 --> 05:32:03,740
was that regardless

20399
05:32:03,740 --> 05:32:04,400
of the sentiments

20400
05:32:04,400 --> 05:32:05,280
of either

20401
05:32:05,280 --> 05:32:06,260
I had detached Mr.

20402
05:32:06,260 --> 05:32:06,660
Bingley

20403
05:32:06,660 --> 05:32:07,800
from your sister.

20404
05:32:07,800 --> 05:32:08,580
And the other

20405
05:32:08,580 --> 05:32:09,780
that I had, in defiance

20406
05:32:09,780 --> 05:32:10,980
of various claims,

20407
05:32:10,980 --> 05:32:12,180
in defiance of honor

20408
05:32:12,180 --> 05:32:13,700
and humanity, ruined

20409
05:32:13,700 --> 05:32:15,060
the immediate prosperity

20410
05:32:15,260 --> 05:32:15,960
and blasted

20411
05:32:15,960 --> 05:32:16,880
the prospects of Mr.

20412
05:32:16,880 --> 05:32:18,380
Wickham willfully

20413
05:32:18,380 --> 05:32:19,380
and wantonly

20414
05:32:19,380 --> 05:32:20,040
to have thrown

20415
05:32:20,040 --> 05:32:20,240
off the

20416
05:32:20,240 --> 05:32:21,440
companion of my youth

20417
05:32:21,660 --> 05:32:22,380
the acknowledged

20418
05:32:22,380 --> 05:32:23,580
favorite of my father,

20419
05:32:23,760 --> 05:32:24,720
a man who had

20420
05:32:24,720 --> 05:32:25,400
scarcely any

20421
05:32:25,400 --> 05:32:26,240
other dependents

20422
05:32:26,240 --> 05:32:27,440
than on our patronage

20423
05:32:28,200 --> 05:32:29,100
and who had been brought

20424
05:32:29,100 --> 05:32:29,760
up to expect

20425
05:32:29,760 --> 05:32:30,480
its exertion

20426
05:32:31,500 --> 05:32:31,800
would be

20427
05:32:31,800 --> 05:32:33,000
a depravity

20428
05:32:33,300 --> 05:32:33,620
to which

20429
05:32:33,620 --> 05:32:34,500
to separation of

20430
05:32:34,500 --> 05:32:35,400
two young persons

20431
05:32:35,400 --> 05:32:36,020
whose affection

20432
05:32:36,020 --> 05:32:36,840
could be the growth

20433
05:32:36,840 --> 05:32:38,060
of only a few weeks

20434
05:32:39,240 --> 05:32:39,620
could bear

20435
05:32:39,620 --> 05:32:40,820
no comparison.

20436
05:32:41,640 --> 05:32:42,840
But from the severity of

20437
05:32:42,840 --> 05:32:43,400
that blame

20438
05:32:43,400 --> 05:32:44,340
which was last night

20439
05:32:44,340 --> 05:32:45,720
so liberally bestowed,

20440
05:32:46,860 --> 05:32:47,460
respecting

20441
05:32:47,460 --> 05:32:48,660
each circumstance,

20442
05:32:49,400 --> 05:32:50,340
I shall hope to be

20443
05:32:50,340 --> 05:32:51,540
in future secured.

20444
05:32:51,920 --> 05:32:52,220
When the

20445
05:32:52,220 --> 05:32:53,420
following account of my

20446
05:32:53,700 --> 05:32:54,480
and their motives

20447
05:32:54,480 --> 05:32:55,680
has been read.

20448
05:32:55,800 --> 05:32:57,180
If in the explanation

20449
05:32:57,180 --> 05:32:57,740
of them

20450
05:32:57,740 --> 05:32:59,000
which is due to myself,

20451
05:32:59,580 --> 05:33:00,800
I am under the necessity

20452
05:33:00,800 --> 05:33:01,820
of relating feelings

20453
05:33:01,820 --> 05:33:02,300
which may be

20454
05:33:02,300 --> 05:33:03,500
offensive to yours.

20455
05:33:04,800 --> 05:33:05,660
I can only say that

20456
05:33:05,660 --> 05:33:06,860
I am sorry.

20457
05:33:07,040 --> 05:33:07,740
The necessity

20458
05:33:07,740 --> 05:33:08,640
must be obeyed

20459
05:33:08,640 --> 05:33:09,900
and further apology

20460
05:33:09,900 --> 05:33:11,100
would be absurd.

20461
05:33:12,920 --> 05:33:13,760
I had not been long

20462
05:33:13,760 --> 05:33:14,960
in Hertfordshire before.

20463
05:33:14,960 --> 05:33:15,780
I saw in common

20464
05:33:15,780 --> 05:33:16,340
with others

20465
05:33:16,340 --> 05:33:17,240
that Bingley preferred

20466
05:33:17,240 --> 05:33:18,120
your elder sister

20467
05:33:18,120 --> 05:33:18,780
to any other

20468
05:33:18,780 --> 05:33:19,340
young woman in

20469
05:33:19,340 --> 05:33:19,920
the country.

20470
05:33:21,500 --> 05:33:21,900
But it was

20471
05:33:21,900 --> 05:33:22,320
not till the

20472
05:33:22,320 --> 05:33:23,300
evening of the dance

20473
05:33:23,300 --> 05:33:24,300
at Netherfield

20474
05:33:24,300 --> 05:33:24,680
that I had

20475
05:33:24,680 --> 05:33:25,520
any apprehension

20476
05:33:25,520 --> 05:33:26,120
of his feeling,

20477
05:33:26,120 --> 05:33:27,320
a serious attachment.

20478
05:33:28,140 --> 05:33:28,860
I had often

20479
05:33:28,860 --> 05:33:30,080
seen him in love before

20480
05:33:30,920 --> 05:33:31,880
at that ball while,

20481
05:33:31,880 --> 05:33:32,100
I had

20482
05:33:32,100 --> 05:33:32,580
the honor of

20483
05:33:32,580 --> 05:33:33,560
dancing with you.

20484
05:33:33,560 --> 05:33:34,200
I was first

20485
05:33:34,200 --> 05:33:35,000
made acquainted

20486
05:33:35,000 --> 05:33:36,260
by Sir William Lucas's

20487
05:33:36,260 --> 05:33:37,640
accidental information

20488
05:33:38,280 --> 05:33:39,420
that Bigley's attentions

20489
05:33:39,420 --> 05:33:40,100
to your sister

20490
05:33:40,100 --> 05:33:40,820
had given rise

20491
05:33:40,820 --> 05:33:42,260
to a general expectation

20492
05:33:42,260 --> 05:33:43,460
of their marriage.

20493
05:33:44,640 --> 05:33:45,380
He spoke of it

20494
05:33:45,380 --> 05:33:46,580
as a certain event

20495
05:33:46,880 --> 05:33:48,000
of which the time alone

20496
05:33:48,000 --> 05:33:49,200
could be undecided.

20497
05:33:50,300 --> 05:33:51,440
From that moment,

20498
05:33:51,440 --> 05:33:52,620
I observed my friend's

20499
05:33:52,620 --> 05:33:53,820
behavior attentively,

20500
05:33:54,240 --> 05:33:54,720
and I could

20501
05:33:54,720 --> 05:33:55,440
then perceive

20502
05:33:55,440 --> 05:33:56,400
that his partiality

20503
05:33:56,400 --> 05:33:56,700
for Miss

20504
05:33:56,700 --> 05:33:58,020
Bennett was beyond what

20505
05:33:58,020 --> 05:33:58,440
I had ever

20506
05:33:58,440 --> 05:33:59,640
witnessed in him.

20507
05:34:00,600 --> 05:34:01,140
Your Sister.

20508
05:34:01,140 --> 05:34:02,340
I also watched

20509
05:34:02,540 --> 05:34:03,540
her look and manners

20510
05:34:03,540 --> 05:34:04,820
were open, cheerful

20511
05:34:04,820 --> 05:34:06,020
and engaging as ever,

20512
05:34:06,560 --> 05:34:07,680
but without any symptom

20513
05:34:07,680 --> 05:34:08,920
of peculiar regard.

20514
05:34:09,960 --> 05:34:11,160
And I remained

20515
05:34:11,460 --> 05:34:11,760
from the

20516
05:34:11,760 --> 05:34:12,960
evening's scrutiny

20517
05:34:13,260 --> 05:34:13,680
that though

20518
05:34:13,680 --> 05:34:14,280
she received

20519
05:34:14,280 --> 05:34:14,960
his attentions

20520
05:34:14,960 --> 05:34:15,860
with pleasure,

20521
05:34:15,860 --> 05:34:17,040
she did not invite them

20522
05:34:17,040 --> 05:34:18,320
by any participation

20523
05:34:18,320 --> 05:34:19,520
of sentiment.

20524
05:34:19,820 --> 05:34:20,640
If you have not

20525
05:34:20,640 --> 05:34:21,840
been mistaken here,

20526
05:34:21,980 --> 05:34:22,880
I must have been

20527
05:34:22,880 --> 05:34:24,080
in an error.

20528
05:34:24,180 --> 05:34:24,960
Your superior

20529
05:34:24,960 --> 05:34:26,220
knowledge of your sister

20530
05:34:26,220 --> 05:34:26,780
must make the

20531
05:34:26,780 --> 05:34:27,980
latter probable.

20532
05:34:28,580 --> 05:34:29,760
If it be so,

20533
05:34:29,760 --> 05:34:30,740
if I have been misled

20534
05:34:30,740 --> 05:34:31,380
by such error

20535
05:34:31,380 --> 05:34:32,580
to inflict pain on her,

20536
05:34:33,380 --> 05:34:34,260
your resentment has

20537
05:34:34,260 --> 05:34:35,460
not been unreasonable.

20538
05:34:35,760 --> 05:34:36,840
But I shall not scruple

20539
05:34:36,840 --> 05:34:37,760
to assert

20540
05:34:37,760 --> 05:34:38,780
that the serenity

20541
05:34:38,780 --> 05:34:39,480
of your sister's

20542
05:34:39,480 --> 05:34:40,680
countenance and air

20543
05:34:40,800 --> 05:34:41,460
was such

20544
05:34:41,460 --> 05:34:42,140
as might have given

20545
05:34:42,140 --> 05:34:42,780
the most acute

20546
05:34:42,780 --> 05:34:43,260
observer

20547
05:34:43,260 --> 05:34:44,460
a conviction that

20548
05:34:44,480 --> 05:34:45,560
however amiable

20549
05:34:45,560 --> 05:34:46,760
her temper,

20550
05:34:46,760 --> 05:34:47,960
her heart was not likely

20551
05:34:47,960 --> 05:34:49,160
to be easily touched.

20552
05:34:50,160 --> 05:34:51,200
That was desirous

20553
05:34:51,200 --> 05:34:51,740
of believing

20554
05:34:51,740 --> 05:34:52,500
her indifferent

20555
05:34:52,500 --> 05:34:53,700
is certain.

20556
05:34:53,760 --> 05:34:54,540
But I will venture

20557
05:34:54,540 --> 05:34:54,900
to say

20558
05:34:54,900 --> 05:34:56,120
that my investigations

20559
05:34:56,120 --> 05:34:56,840
and decisions

20560
05:34:56,840 --> 05:34:57,200
are not

20561
05:34:57,200 --> 05:34:58,260
usually influenced

20562
05:34:58,260 --> 05:34:59,880
by my hopes or fears.

20563
05:35:00,680 --> 05:35:01,680
I did not believe her

20564
05:35:01,680 --> 05:35:02,420
to be indifferent

20565
05:35:02,420 --> 05:35:03,480
because I wished it.

20566
05:35:04,520 --> 05:35:05,360
I believed it on

20567
05:35:05,360 --> 05:35:06,560
impartial conviction

20568
05:35:06,860 --> 05:35:07,680
as truly as

20569
05:35:07,680 --> 05:35:08,880
I wished it, in reason.

20570
05:35:10,080 --> 05:35:10,860
My objections

20571
05:35:10,860 --> 05:35:11,820
to the marriage

20572
05:35:11,820 --> 05:35:12,720
were not merely those

20573
05:35:12,720 --> 05:35:13,500
which I last night

20574
05:35:13,500 --> 05:35:14,060
acknowledged

20575
05:35:14,060 --> 05:35:14,760
to have required

20576
05:35:14,760 --> 05:35:15,660
the utmost force

20577
05:35:15,660 --> 05:35:16,760
of passion to put aside.

20578
05:35:16,760 --> 05:35:17,960
In my own case,

20579
05:35:18,960 --> 05:35:19,920
the want connection

20580
05:35:19,920 --> 05:35:20,900
could not be so great

20581
05:35:20,900 --> 05:35:21,900
an evil to my friend

20582
05:35:21,900 --> 05:35:23,100
as to me.

20583
05:35:25,100 --> 05:35:25,920
But there were other

20584
05:35:25,920 --> 05:35:27,120
causes of repugnance.

20585
05:35:27,660 --> 05:35:28,940
Causes which, though

20586
05:35:28,960 --> 05:35:29,840
still existing

20587
05:35:29,840 --> 05:35:30,500
and existing

20588
05:35:30,500 --> 05:35:31,460
to an equal degree.

20589
05:35:31,460 --> 05:35:32,660
In both instances,

20590
05:35:33,360 --> 05:35:34,560
I had myself endeavored

20591
05:35:34,560 --> 05:35:35,240
to forget

20592
05:35:35,240 --> 05:35:35,960
because they were

20593
05:35:35,960 --> 05:35:36,620
not immediately

20594
05:35:36,620 --> 05:35:37,820
before me.

20595
05:35:38,480 --> 05:35:39,180
These causes

20596
05:35:39,180 --> 05:35:40,100
must be stated,

20597
05:35:40,100 --> 05:35:41,300
though briefly.

20598
05:35:41,660 --> 05:35:42,420
The situation

20599
05:35:42,420 --> 05:35:43,020
of your mother's

20600
05:35:43,020 --> 05:35:43,640
family, though

20601
05:35:43,640 --> 05:35:44,840
objectionable,

20602
05:35:44,960 --> 05:35:45,560
was nothing

20603
05:35:45,560 --> 05:35:46,580
in comparison of that

20604
05:35:46,580 --> 05:35:48,120
total want of propriety

20605
05:35:48,120 --> 05:35:49,320
so frequently,

20606
05:35:49,320 --> 05:35:50,600
so almost uniformly

20607
05:35:50,600 --> 05:35:51,800
betrayed by herself,

20608
05:35:52,560 --> 05:35:53,300
by your three

20609
05:35:53,300 --> 05:35:54,320
younger sisters,

20610
05:35:54,320 --> 05:35:55,520
occasionally even

20611
05:35:55,520 --> 05:35:56,720
by your father.

20612
05:35:57,260 --> 05:35:58,340
Pardon me.

20613
05:35:58,340 --> 05:35:59,060
It pains me

20614
05:35:59,060 --> 05:36:00,260
to offend you,

20615
05:36:00,680 --> 05:36:01,860
but amidst your concern

20616
05:36:01,860 --> 05:36:02,580
for the defects

20617
05:36:02,580 --> 05:36:02,780
of your

20618
05:36:02,780 --> 05:36:03,980
nearest relations

20619
05:36:04,380 --> 05:36:05,360
and your displeasure

20620
05:36:05,360 --> 05:36:05,640
at this

20621
05:36:05,640 --> 05:36:06,840
representation of them,

20622
05:36:07,440 --> 05:36:08,000
let it give

20623
05:36:08,000 --> 05:36:08,760
you consolation

20624
05:36:08,760 --> 05:36:09,740
to consider

20625
05:36:09,740 --> 05:36:10,200
that to have

20626
05:36:10,200 --> 05:36:11,400
conducted yourselves

20627
05:36:11,840 --> 05:36:12,660
so as to avoid

20628
05:36:12,660 --> 05:36:13,640
any share of the light.

20629
05:36:13,640 --> 05:36:15,200
Censure is praise

20630
05:36:15,200 --> 05:36:15,620
no less

20631
05:36:15,620 --> 05:36:16,580
generally bestowed

20632
05:36:16,580 --> 05:36:16,980
on you

20633
05:36:16,980 --> 05:36:18,240
and your eldest sister

20634
05:36:18,600 --> 05:36:19,080
than it is

20635
05:36:19,080 --> 05:36:20,240
honorable to the sense

20636
05:36:20,240 --> 05:36:21,440
and disposition of both.

20637
05:36:23,100 --> 05:36:23,900
I only say,

20638
05:36:23,900 --> 05:36:24,920
Father, that from

20639
05:36:24,920 --> 05:36:25,400
what passed

20640
05:36:25,400 --> 05:36:26,360
that evening,

20641
05:36:26,360 --> 05:36:27,380
my opinion of all

20642
05:36:27,380 --> 05:36:28,680
parties was confirmed

20643
05:36:29,000 --> 05:36:30,020
and every inducement

20644
05:36:30,020 --> 05:36:31,220
heightened

20645
05:36:31,380 --> 05:36:32,180
which could have led me

20646
05:36:32,180 --> 05:36:32,540
before

20647
05:36:32,540 --> 05:36:33,620
to preserve friend

20648
05:36:33,620 --> 05:36:33,960
from what

20649
05:36:33,960 --> 05:36:34,620
I esteemed

20650
05:36:34,620 --> 05:36:35,000
a most

20651
05:36:35,000 --> 05:36:36,200
unhappy connection.

20652
05:36:37,080 --> 05:36:38,040
He left Netherfield

20653
05:36:38,040 --> 05:36:38,520
for London

20654
05:36:38,520 --> 05:36:39,720
on the day following.

20655
05:36:39,960 --> 05:36:40,340
As you,

20656
05:36:40,340 --> 05:36:41,540
I am certain, remember

20657
05:36:41,940 --> 05:36:42,660
with the design

20658
05:36:42,660 --> 05:36:43,860
of soon returning,

20659
05:36:46,520 --> 05:36:46,980
the part

20660
05:36:46,980 --> 05:36:47,960
which I acted is now

20661
05:36:47,960 --> 05:36:49,160
to be explained.

20662
05:36:49,380 --> 05:36:50,720
His sister's uneasiness

20663
05:36:50,720 --> 05:36:51,840
had been equally excited

20664
05:36:51,840 --> 05:36:53,040
with my own.

20665
05:36:53,660 --> 05:36:54,560
Our coincidence

20666
05:36:54,560 --> 05:36:55,080
of feeling

20667
05:36:55,080 --> 05:36:56,280
was soon discovered

20668
05:36:56,960 --> 05:36:57,860
and alike

20669
05:36:57,860 --> 05:36:58,980
sensible that no time

20670
05:36:58,980 --> 05:36:59,640
was to be lost

20671
05:36:59,640 --> 05:37:00,260
in detaching

20672
05:37:00,260 --> 05:37:01,460
their brother.

20673
05:37:01,980 --> 05:37:03,080
We shortly resolved on

20674
05:37:03,080 --> 05:37:03,600
joining him

20675
05:37:03,600 --> 05:37:04,800
directly in London.

20676
05:37:06,380 --> 05:37:07,580
We accordingly went,

20677
05:37:07,740 --> 05:37:08,100
and then

20678
05:37:08,100 --> 05:37:09,140
I readily engaged

20679
05:37:09,140 --> 05:37:09,680
in the office

20680
05:37:09,680 --> 05:37:10,280
of pointing out

20681
05:37:10,280 --> 05:37:11,760
to my friend the certain

20682
05:37:11,760 --> 05:37:13,080
evils of such a choice.

20683
05:37:13,700 --> 05:37:14,420
I described

20684
05:37:14,420 --> 05:37:15,020
and enforced

20685
05:37:15,020 --> 05:37:16,220
them earnestly.

20686
05:37:16,640 --> 05:37:17,240
But however,

20687
05:37:17,240 --> 05:37:18,080
this remonstrance

20688
05:37:18,080 --> 05:37:18,900
might have staggered

20689
05:37:18,900 --> 05:37:19,400
or delayed

20690
05:37:19,400 --> 05:37:20,600
his determination.

20691
05:37:20,940 --> 05:37:22,140
I do not suppose that

20692
05:37:22,140 --> 05:37:23,040
it would ultimately

20693
05:37:23,040 --> 05:37:23,640
have prevented

20694
05:37:23,640 --> 05:37:24,260
the marriage

20695
05:37:25,220 --> 05:37:25,880
had it not been

20696
05:37:25,880 --> 05:37:26,880
seconded by

20697
05:37:26,880 --> 05:37:27,600
the assurance

20698
05:37:27,600 --> 05:37:28,520
which I hesitated.

20699
05:37:28,520 --> 05:37:29,520
Not in giving

20700
05:37:29,520 --> 05:37:30,360
of your sisters

20701
05:37:30,360 --> 05:37:31,560
indifference.

20702
05:37:33,060 --> 05:37:33,680
He had before

20703
05:37:33,680 --> 05:37:34,140
believed her

20704
05:37:34,140 --> 05:37:35,220
to return his affection

20705
05:37:35,220 --> 05:37:35,940
with sincere,

20706
05:37:35,940 --> 05:37:36,600
if not with

20707
05:37:36,600 --> 05:37:37,800
equal regard.

20708
05:37:38,300 --> 05:37:39,200
But Bingley has great

20709
05:37:39,200 --> 05:37:40,400
natural modesty,

20710
05:37:40,400 --> 05:37:40,640
with a

20711
05:37:40,640 --> 05:37:41,580
stronger dependance

20712
05:37:41,580 --> 05:37:42,320
on my judgment

20713
05:37:42,320 --> 05:37:43,520
than on his own.

20714
05:37:43,880 --> 05:37:44,600
To convince him,

20715
05:37:44,600 --> 05:37:45,380
therefore,

20716
05:37:45,380 --> 05:37:46,160
that he had deceived

20717
05:37:46,160 --> 05:37:46,580
himself

20718
05:37:46,580 --> 05:37:47,180
was no very

20719
05:37:47,180 --> 05:37:48,380
difficult point

20720
05:37:48,780 --> 05:37:49,760
to persuade him against

20721
05:37:49,760 --> 05:37:50,420
returning into

20722
05:37:50,420 --> 05:37:51,300
Hertfordshire

20723
05:37:51,300 --> 05:37:52,460
when that conviction had

20724
05:37:52,460 --> 05:37:53,700
given was scarcely

20725
05:37:53,700 --> 05:37:54,900
the work of a moment.

20726
05:37:55,860 --> 05:37:57,020
I cannot blame myself

20727
05:37:57,020 --> 05:37:57,620
for having done

20728
05:37:57,620 --> 05:37:58,820
thus much.

20729
05:37:58,980 --> 05:37:59,400
There is but

20730
05:37:59,400 --> 05:38:00,660
one part of my conduct

20731
05:38:00,660 --> 05:38:02,000
in the whole affair on

20732
05:38:02,160 --> 05:38:02,940
I do not reflect

20733
05:38:02,940 --> 05:38:04,140
with satisfaction.

20734
05:38:04,800 --> 05:38:05,240
It is that

20735
05:38:05,240 --> 05:38:06,500
I condescended to adopt

20736
05:38:06,500 --> 05:38:06,960
the measures

20737
05:38:06,960 --> 05:38:07,820
of art so far

20738
05:38:07,820 --> 05:38:09,120
as to conceal from him

20739
05:38:09,300 --> 05:38:10,340
your sisters being

20740
05:38:10,340 --> 05:38:11,040
in town.

20741
05:38:12,000 --> 05:38:12,420
I knew it

20742
05:38:12,420 --> 05:38:13,800
myself as it was known

20743
05:38:13,800 --> 05:38:15,000
to Miss Bingley,

20744
05:38:15,180 --> 05:38:15,800
but her brother

20745
05:38:15,800 --> 05:38:16,440
is even yet

20746
05:38:16,440 --> 05:38:17,640
ignorant of it,

20747
05:38:18,840 --> 05:38:19,880
that they might have met

20748
05:38:19,880 --> 05:38:20,420
without ill

20749
05:38:20,420 --> 05:38:21,300
consequences.

20750
05:38:21,300 --> 05:38:22,500
Perhaps Probable.

20751
05:38:23,300 --> 05:38:24,000
But his regard

20752
05:38:24,000 --> 05:38:24,840
did not appear to me

20753
05:38:24,840 --> 05:38:25,680
enough extinguished

20754
05:38:25,680 --> 05:38:26,880
for him to see her

20755
05:38:26,880 --> 05:38:28,080
without some danger.

20756
05:38:29,840 --> 05:38:30,500
Perhaps this

20757
05:38:30,500 --> 05:38:31,320
concealment,

20758
05:38:31,320 --> 05:38:32,300
this disguise

20759
05:38:32,300 --> 05:38:33,500
was beneath me.

20760
05:38:33,800 --> 05:38:35,000
It is done, however,

20761
05:38:35,160 --> 05:38:35,840
and it was done

20762
05:38:35,840 --> 05:38:37,040
for the best.

20763
05:38:37,380 --> 05:38:38,120
On this subject,

20764
05:38:38,120 --> 05:38:38,660
I have nothing

20765
05:38:38,660 --> 05:38:39,680
more to say.

20766
05:38:39,680 --> 05:38:40,620
No other apology

20767
05:38:40,620 --> 05:38:41,820
to offer.

20768
05:38:41,820 --> 05:38:42,560
If I have wounded

20769
05:38:42,560 --> 05:38:43,500
your sister's feelings,

20770
05:38:43,500 --> 05:38:44,720
it was unknowingly done.

20771
05:38:45,860 --> 05:38:46,220
And though

20772
05:38:46,220 --> 05:38:46,860
the motives

20773
05:38:46,860 --> 05:38:47,600
which govern me,

20774
05:38:47,600 --> 05:38:48,080
may to you

20775
05:38:48,080 --> 05:38:48,780
very naturally

20776
05:38:48,780 --> 05:38:49,980
appear insufficient,

20777
05:38:50,960 --> 05:38:51,720
I have not yet

20778
05:38:51,720 --> 05:38:52,920
learned to condemn them

20779
05:38:54,680 --> 05:38:55,620
with respect to that

20780
05:38:55,620 --> 05:38:56,180
other more

20781
05:38:56,180 --> 05:38:57,260
weighty accusation

20782
05:38:57,260 --> 05:38:58,200
of having injured Mr.

20783
05:38:58,200 --> 05:38:59,400
Wickham.

20784
05:39:00,200 --> 05:39:01,320
I can only refuted

20785
05:39:01,320 --> 05:39:01,860
by laying

20786
05:39:01,860 --> 05:39:02,340
before you

20787
05:39:02,340 --> 05:39:02,820
the whole of

20788
05:39:02,820 --> 05:39:03,380
his connection

20789
05:39:03,380 --> 05:39:04,580
with my family

20790
05:39:04,800 --> 05:39:05,240
of what

20791
05:39:05,240 --> 05:39:06,140
he has particularly

20792
05:39:06,140 --> 05:39:06,720
accused me.

20793
05:39:06,720 --> 05:39:07,920
I am ignorant

20794
05:39:07,940 --> 05:39:08,960
but of the truth of what

20795
05:39:08,960 --> 05:39:09,680
I shall relate.

20796
05:39:09,680 --> 05:39:10,560
I can summon more

20797
05:39:10,560 --> 05:39:11,360
than one witness

20798
05:39:11,360 --> 05:39:12,600
of undoubted veracity.

20799
05:39:14,460 --> 05:39:14,760
Mr.

20800
05:39:14,760 --> 05:39:15,720
Wickham is the son of

20801
05:39:15,720 --> 05:39:17,060
a very respectable man

20802
05:39:17,420 --> 05:39:18,380
who had for many years

20803
05:39:18,380 --> 05:39:19,020
the management

20804
05:39:19,020 --> 05:39:19,380
of all

20805
05:39:19,380 --> 05:39:20,580
the Pemberley Estates,

20806
05:39:20,840 --> 05:39:21,900
and whose good conduct

20807
05:39:21,900 --> 05:39:22,640
in the discharge

20808
05:39:22,640 --> 05:39:23,640
of his trust,

20809
05:39:23,640 --> 05:39:24,740
naturally inclined

20810
05:39:24,740 --> 05:39:25,320
my father,

20811
05:39:25,320 --> 05:39:26,520
to be of service to him.

20812
05:39:26,840 --> 05:39:28,040
And on George Wickham,

20813
05:39:28,340 --> 05:39:29,540
who was his godson.

20814
05:39:30,120 --> 05:39:30,740
His kindness

20815
05:39:30,740 --> 05:39:31,340
was therefore

20816
05:39:31,340 --> 05:39:32,540
liberally bestowed.

20817
05:39:33,200 --> 05:39:33,780
My father

20818
05:39:33,780 --> 05:39:35,060
supported him at school

20819
05:39:35,100 --> 05:39:35,760
and afterwards

20820
05:39:35,760 --> 05:39:36,920
at Cambridge.

20821
05:39:36,920 --> 05:39:37,740
Most important,

20822
05:39:37,740 --> 05:39:38,720
assistance

20823
05:39:38,720 --> 05:39:39,920
as his own father,

20824
05:39:40,200 --> 05:39:40,980
always poor

20825
05:39:40,980 --> 05:39:41,300
from the

20826
05:39:41,300 --> 05:39:42,080
extravagance of

20827
05:39:42,080 --> 05:39:42,980
his wife,

20828
05:39:42,980 --> 05:39:43,820
would have been unable

20829
05:39:43,820 --> 05:39:44,220
to give him

20830
05:39:44,220 --> 05:39:45,440
a gentleman's education.

20831
05:39:46,500 --> 05:39:47,120
My father was

20832
05:39:47,120 --> 05:39:48,240
not only fond of this

20833
05:39:48,240 --> 05:39:49,440
young man's society

20834
05:39:49,640 --> 05:39:50,180
whose manners

20835
05:39:50,180 --> 05:39:51,380
were always engaging.

20836
05:39:51,680 --> 05:39:52,860
He had also the

20837
05:39:52,860 --> 05:39:54,060
opinion of him

20838
05:39:54,200 --> 05:39:55,160
and hoping the church

20839
05:39:55,160 --> 05:39:56,360
would be his profession,

20840
05:39:56,520 --> 05:39:57,600
intended to provide

20841
05:39:57,600 --> 05:39:58,800
for him in it.

20842
05:39:59,100 --> 05:40:00,300
As for myself,

20843
05:40:00,840 --> 05:40:02,040
it is many, many years.

20844
05:40:02,280 --> 05:40:02,940
I first began

20845
05:40:02,940 --> 05:40:03,740
to think of him in a

20846
05:40:03,740 --> 05:40:04,740
very different manner.

20847
05:40:05,900 --> 05:40:06,420
The vicious

20848
05:40:06,420 --> 05:40:07,760
propensities, the

20849
05:40:07,760 --> 05:40:08,960
want of principle,

20850
05:40:09,020 --> 05:40:09,920
which he was careful

20851
05:40:09,920 --> 05:40:10,500
to guard

20852
05:40:10,500 --> 05:40:11,240
from the knowledge

20853
05:40:11,240 --> 05:40:12,440
of his best friend,

20854
05:40:12,540 --> 05:40:13,320
could not escape

20855
05:40:13,320 --> 05:40:14,040
the observation

20856
05:40:14,040 --> 05:40:15,240
of a young man of nearly

20857
05:40:15,240 --> 05:40:16,080
the same age

20858
05:40:16,080 --> 05:40:17,120
with himself,

20859
05:40:17,120 --> 05:40:17,420
and who

20860
05:40:17,420 --> 05:40:18,240
had opportunities

20861
05:40:18,240 --> 05:40:18,740
of seeing him

20862
05:40:18,740 --> 05:40:19,940
in unguarded moments,

20863
05:40:20,280 --> 05:40:20,820
which Mr.

20864
05:40:20,820 --> 05:40:22,020
Darcy could not have.

20865
05:40:22,940 --> 05:40:23,420
Here again,

20866
05:40:23,420 --> 05:40:24,620
I shall give you pain.

20867
05:40:25,080 --> 05:40:25,800
To what degree?

20868
05:40:25,800 --> 05:40:27,000
You only can tell.

20869
05:40:28,340 --> 05:40:29,180
But whatever may be

20870
05:40:29,180 --> 05:40:30,380
the sentiments which Mr.

20871
05:40:30,380 --> 05:40:31,580
Wickham has created

20872
05:40:32,540 --> 05:40:33,180
a suspicion

20873
05:40:33,180 --> 05:40:34,380
of their nature,

20874
05:40:34,760 --> 05:40:35,540
shall not prevent me

20875
05:40:35,540 --> 05:40:36,200
from unfolding

20876
05:40:36,200 --> 05:40:37,400
his real character.

20877
05:40:37,880 --> 05:40:38,480
It adds even

20878
05:40:38,480 --> 05:40:39,680
another motive.

20879
05:40:40,880 --> 05:40:42,200
My excellent father died

20880
05:40:42,200 --> 05:40:43,400
about five years ago,

20881
05:40:43,500 --> 05:40:44,340
and his attachment

20882
05:40:44,340 --> 05:40:44,760
to Mr.

20883
05:40:44,760 --> 05:40:46,100
Wickham was to the last.

20884
05:40:46,100 --> 05:40:47,100
So steady

20885
05:40:47,100 --> 05:40:48,060
that in his will he

20886
05:40:48,060 --> 05:40:48,680
particularly

20887
05:40:48,680 --> 05:40:49,880
recommended it to me

20888
05:40:50,160 --> 05:40:51,620
to promote advancement

20889
05:40:51,620 --> 05:40:52,560
in the best manner

20890
05:40:52,560 --> 05:40:53,360
that his profession

20891
05:40:53,360 --> 05:40:54,420
might allow.

20892
05:40:54,420 --> 05:40:55,620
And if he took orders

20893
05:40:55,940 --> 05:40:56,660
desired that

20894
05:40:56,660 --> 05:40:57,960
a valuable family living

20895
05:40:57,960 --> 05:40:58,520
might be his

20896
05:40:58,520 --> 05:40:58,860
as soon

20897
05:40:58,860 --> 05:41:00,060
as it became vacant,

20898
05:41:00,620 --> 05:41:01,220
there was also a

20899
05:41:01,220 --> 05:41:03,000
legacy of ?1,000.

20900
05:41:04,200 --> 05:41:05,180
His own father did

20901
05:41:05,180 --> 05:41:06,480
not long survive mine,

20902
05:41:06,740 --> 05:41:07,700
and within half a year

20903
05:41:07,700 --> 05:41:09,020
from these events, Mr.

20904
05:41:09,020 --> 05:41:09,500
Wickham wrote

20905
05:41:09,500 --> 05:41:10,700
to inform that

20906
05:41:11,040 --> 05:41:12,240
having finally resolved

20907
05:41:12,240 --> 05:41:13,440
against taking orders,

20908
05:41:13,820 --> 05:41:14,300
he hoped

20909
05:41:14,300 --> 05:41:15,120
I should not think it

20910
05:41:15,120 --> 05:41:16,140
unreasonable for him

20911
05:41:16,140 --> 05:41:16,700
to expect

20912
05:41:16,700 --> 05:41:17,540
some more immediate

20913
05:41:17,540 --> 05:41:18,840
pecuniary advantage

20914
05:41:19,560 --> 05:41:20,220
in lieu of

20915
05:41:20,220 --> 05:41:21,420
the preferment

20916
05:41:21,420 --> 05:41:21,900
by which

20917
05:41:21,900 --> 05:41:22,400
he could not

20918
05:41:22,400 --> 05:41:23,600
be benefited.

20919
05:41:24,560 --> 05:41:25,640
He had some intention,

20920
05:41:25,640 --> 05:41:26,420
he added,

20921
05:41:26,420 --> 05:41:27,620
of studying the law,

20922
05:41:27,960 --> 05:41:28,920
and I must be aware

20923
05:41:28,920 --> 05:41:30,720
that the interest ?1,000

20924
05:41:30,720 --> 05:41:30,980
would be

20925
05:41:30,980 --> 05:41:31,440
a very

20926
05:41:31,440 --> 05:41:32,420
insufficient support

20927
05:41:32,420 --> 05:41:33,620
therein.

20928
05:41:34,500 --> 05:41:35,400
I rather wished

20929
05:41:35,400 --> 05:41:36,020
and believed him

20930
05:41:36,020 --> 05:41:37,220
to be sincere,

20931
05:41:37,280 --> 05:41:38,040
but at any rate

20932
05:41:38,040 --> 05:41:38,960
was perfectly ready

20933
05:41:38,960 --> 05:41:40,380
to accede his proposal.

20934
05:41:41,280 --> 05:41:42,080
I knew that Mr.

20935
05:41:42,080 --> 05:41:42,560
Wickham ought

20936
05:41:42,560 --> 05:41:43,760
not to be a clergyman.

20937
05:41:44,060 --> 05:41:44,600
The business

20938
05:41:44,600 --> 05:41:45,140
was therefore

20939
05:41:45,140 --> 05:41:46,340
soon settled.

20940
05:41:46,460 --> 05:41:47,520
He resigned all claim

20941
05:41:47,520 --> 05:41:48,080
to assistance

20942
05:41:48,080 --> 05:41:49,460
in the church where.

20943
05:41:49,460 --> 05:41:49,940
It possible

20944
05:41:49,940 --> 05:41:50,360
that he could

20945
05:41:50,360 --> 05:41:51,800
ever be in a situation

20946
05:41:51,800 --> 05:41:53,120
to receive it and

20947
05:41:53,120 --> 05:41:54,320
accepted in return.

20948
05:41:54,420 --> 05:41:55,640
?3,000.

20949
05:41:56,760 --> 05:41:57,900
All connection between

20950
05:41:57,900 --> 05:41:59,100
us seemed now dissolved.

20951
05:41:59,820 --> 05:42:00,900
I thought to ill of him

20952
05:42:00,900 --> 05:42:01,500
to invite him

20953
05:42:01,500 --> 05:42:02,700
to Pemberley

20954
05:42:03,240 --> 05:42:03,720
or admit

20955
05:42:03,720 --> 05:42:04,920
his society in town.

20956
05:42:06,540 --> 05:42:07,100
In town

20957
05:42:07,100 --> 05:42:07,520
I believe

20958
05:42:07,520 --> 05:42:08,720
he chiefly lived.

20959
05:42:08,820 --> 05:42:09,620
But his studying

20960
05:42:09,620 --> 05:42:09,980
the law

20961
05:42:09,980 --> 05:42:11,180
was a mere pretense

20962
05:42:11,400 --> 05:42:12,420
and being now free

20963
05:42:12,420 --> 05:42:13,560
from all restraint.

20964
05:42:13,560 --> 05:42:14,520
His life was a life

20965
05:42:14,520 --> 05:42:15,180
of idleness

20966
05:42:15,180 --> 05:42:16,380
and dissipation.

20967
05:42:17,280 --> 05:42:18,200
For about three years,

20968
05:42:18,200 --> 05:42:19,400
I heard little of him,

20969
05:42:19,680 --> 05:42:20,460
but on the decease

20970
05:42:20,460 --> 05:42:21,140
of the incumbent

20971
05:42:21,140 --> 05:42:21,660
of the living,

20972
05:42:21,660 --> 05:42:21,960
which had

20973
05:42:21,960 --> 05:42:23,160
been designed for him,

20974
05:42:23,280 --> 05:42:24,320
he applied to me again

20975
05:42:24,320 --> 05:42:24,780
by letter

20976
05:42:24,780 --> 05:42:25,980
for the presentation.

20977
05:42:27,380 --> 05:42:28,460
His circumstances

20978
05:42:28,460 --> 05:42:29,180
he assured me

20979
05:42:29,180 --> 05:42:30,320
and I had no difficulty

20980
05:42:30,320 --> 05:42:30,840
in believing

20981
05:42:30,840 --> 05:42:32,480
it were exceedingly bad.

20982
05:42:32,940 --> 05:42:33,900
He had found the law

20983
05:42:33,900 --> 05:42:34,320
a most

20984
05:42:34,320 --> 05:42:35,520
unprofitable study

20985
05:42:35,720 --> 05:42:36,240
and was now

20986
05:42:36,240 --> 05:42:37,220
absolutely resolved

20987
05:42:37,220 --> 05:42:38,420
on being ordained.

20988
05:42:39,000 --> 05:42:39,960
If I would present him

20989
05:42:39,960 --> 05:42:40,440
to the living

20990
05:42:40,440 --> 05:42:41,520
in question

20991
05:42:41,520 --> 05:42:42,380
of which he trusted,

20992
05:42:42,380 --> 05:42:42,680
there could

20993
05:42:42,680 --> 05:42:43,880
be little doubt,

20994
05:42:43,880 --> 05:42:44,900
as he was well assured

20995
05:42:44,900 --> 05:42:45,560
that I had no other

20996
05:42:45,560 --> 05:42:46,760
person to provide for

20997
05:42:47,060 --> 05:42:48,380
and I could not have my

20998
05:42:48,380 --> 05:42:49,140
revered father's

20999
05:42:49,140 --> 05:42:49,820
intentions.

21000
05:42:51,980 --> 05:42:52,580
You will hardly

21001
05:42:52,580 --> 05:42:53,120
blame me for

21002
05:42:53,120 --> 05:42:54,120
refusing to comply

21003
05:42:54,120 --> 05:42:55,320
with this entreaty

21004
05:42:55,760 --> 05:42:56,580
or for resisting

21005
05:42:56,580 --> 05:42:57,780
every repetition of it.

21006
05:42:59,160 --> 05:42:59,940
His resentment

21007
05:42:59,940 --> 05:43:00,740
was in proportion

21008
05:43:00,740 --> 05:43:00,960
to the

21009
05:43:00,960 --> 05:43:01,560
distress of

21010
05:43:01,560 --> 05:43:02,760
his circumstances,

21011
05:43:03,540 --> 05:43:04,320
and he was doubtless

21012
05:43:04,320 --> 05:43:04,880
as violent

21013
05:43:04,880 --> 05:43:05,840
in his abuse of me,

21014
05:43:05,840 --> 05:43:07,040
to others

21015
05:43:07,440 --> 05:43:08,480
as in his reproaches

21016
05:43:08,480 --> 05:43:09,680
to myself.

21017
05:43:11,900 --> 05:43:12,900
After this period,

21018
05:43:12,900 --> 05:43:13,620
every appearance

21019
05:43:13,620 --> 05:43:14,240
of acquaintance

21020
05:43:14,240 --> 05:43:15,440
was dropped.

21021
05:43:16,920 --> 05:43:17,640
How he lived?

21022
05:43:17,640 --> 05:43:18,840
I know not.

21023
05:43:18,920 --> 05:43:19,680
But last summer

21024
05:43:19,680 --> 05:43:20,280
he was again

21025
05:43:20,280 --> 05:43:21,480
most painfully brooded

21026
05:43:21,480 --> 05:43:22,680
on my notice.

21027
05:43:24,060 --> 05:43:24,840
I must now mention

21028
05:43:24,840 --> 05:43:25,620
a circumstance

21029
05:43:25,620 --> 05:43:26,220
which I would wish

21030
05:43:26,220 --> 05:43:27,420
to forget myself

21031
05:43:28,620 --> 05:43:29,780
and which no obligation

21032
05:43:29,780 --> 05:43:30,600
less than the present

21033
05:43:30,600 --> 05:43:31,280
should induce me

21034
05:43:31,280 --> 05:43:31,980
to unfold to

21035
05:43:31,980 --> 05:43:33,180
any human being.

21036
05:43:34,560 --> 05:43:35,760
Having said thus, much,

21037
05:43:36,120 --> 05:43:37,020
I feel no doubt of

21038
05:43:37,020 --> 05:43:38,220
your secrecy.

21039
05:43:39,000 --> 05:43:39,980
My sister,

21040
05:43:39,980 --> 05:43:40,520
who is more

21041
05:43:40,520 --> 05:43:41,240
than ten years

21042
05:43:41,240 --> 05:43:42,240
my junior,

21043
05:43:42,240 --> 05:43:42,860
was left

21044
05:43:42,860 --> 05:43:43,740
to the guardianship

21045
05:43:43,740 --> 05:43:44,300
of my mother's

21046
05:43:44,300 --> 05:43:44,840
nephew,

21047
05:43:44,840 --> 05:43:46,040
Colonel Fitzwilliam

21048
05:43:46,080 --> 05:43:46,960
and myself.

21049
05:43:49,100 --> 05:43:50,060
About a year ago

21050
05:43:50,060 --> 05:43:50,360
she was

21051
05:43:50,360 --> 05:43:51,560
taken from school

21052
05:43:52,980 --> 05:43:54,000
and an establishment

21053
05:43:54,000 --> 05:43:54,840
formed for her

21054
05:43:54,840 --> 05:43:55,760
in London.

21055
05:43:55,760 --> 05:43:56,880
And last summer

21056
05:43:56,880 --> 05:43:57,920
she went with the lady

21057
05:43:57,920 --> 05:43:59,060
who presided it

21058
05:43:59,060 --> 05:44:00,260
to Ramsgate

21059
05:44:00,920 --> 05:44:01,520
and thither

21060
05:44:01,520 --> 05:44:02,340
also went Mr.

21061
05:44:02,340 --> 05:44:04,100
Wickham, undoubtedly

21062
05:44:04,100 --> 05:44:05,300
by design,

21063
05:44:06,200 --> 05:44:06,500
for that

21064
05:44:06,500 --> 05:44:07,140
proved to have been

21065
05:44:07,140 --> 05:44:08,340
a prior acquaintance,

21066
05:44:08,480 --> 05:44:09,000
him and Mrs.

21067
05:44:09,000 --> 05:44:10,200
Young,

21068
05:44:10,800 --> 05:44:11,720
in whose character

21069
05:44:11,720 --> 05:44:12,300
we were most

21070
05:44:12,300 --> 05:44:13,500
unhappily deceived

21071
05:44:15,000 --> 05:44:16,200
and by her connivance

21072
05:44:16,200 --> 05:44:17,400
and aid.

21073
05:44:17,540 --> 05:44:18,180
He so far

21074
05:44:18,180 --> 05:44:19,140
recommended himself

21075
05:44:19,140 --> 05:44:20,340
to Georgiana,

21076
05:44:21,080 --> 05:44:22,160
whose affection at heart

21077
05:44:22,160 --> 05:44:22,560
retained

21078
05:44:22,560 --> 05:44:23,420
a strong impression

21079
05:44:23,420 --> 05:44:24,140
of his kindness

21080
05:44:24,140 --> 05:44:25,340
to her as a child,

21081
05:44:25,880 --> 05:44:26,940
that she was persuaded

21082
05:44:26,940 --> 05:44:27,320
to believe

21083
05:44:27,320 --> 05:44:28,520
herself, love,

21084
05:44:28,760 --> 05:44:29,060
and to

21085
05:44:29,060 --> 05:44:30,420
consent to an elopement.

21086
05:44:31,800 --> 05:44:33,160
She was then but 15,

21087
05:44:33,360 --> 05:44:33,920
which must be

21088
05:44:33,920 --> 05:44:35,120
her excuse,

21089
05:44:35,600 --> 05:44:36,080
and after

21090
05:44:36,080 --> 05:44:37,220
stating her imprudence,

21091
05:44:37,220 --> 05:44:38,420
I happy to add

21092
05:44:38,900 --> 05:44:39,560
that I owed the

21093
05:44:39,560 --> 05:44:40,040
knowledge of

21094
05:44:40,040 --> 05:44:40,820
it to herself.

21095
05:44:42,300 --> 05:44:42,920
I joined them

21096
05:44:42,920 --> 05:44:43,800
unexpectedly a

21097
05:44:43,800 --> 05:44:44,360
day or two

21098
05:44:44,360 --> 05:44:44,820
before the

21099
05:44:44,820 --> 05:44:46,020
intended elopement,

21100
05:44:47,420 --> 05:44:48,620
and then Georgiana,

21101
05:44:48,900 --> 05:44:49,860
unable to support

21102
05:44:49,860 --> 05:44:50,900
the idea of grieving

21103
05:44:50,900 --> 05:44:52,100
and defending a brother

21104
05:44:53,060 --> 05:44:53,420
whom she

21105
05:44:53,420 --> 05:44:54,120
almost looked up

21106
05:44:54,120 --> 05:44:55,160
to as a father,

21107
05:44:55,160 --> 05:44:55,740
acknowledged

21108
05:44:55,740 --> 05:44:56,940
the whole To me.

21109
05:44:58,020 --> 05:44:58,940
You may imagine what

21110
05:44:58,940 --> 05:45:00,620
I felt and how I acted.

21111
05:45:02,660 --> 05:45:03,120
Regard

21112
05:45:03,120 --> 05:45:03,720
for my sisters

21113
05:45:03,720 --> 05:45:04,580
credit and feelings

21114
05:45:04,580 --> 05:45:05,180
prevented any

21115
05:45:05,180 --> 05:45:06,380
public exposure.

21116
05:45:08,300 --> 05:45:09,120
But I wrote to Mr.

21117
05:45:09,120 --> 05:45:09,500
Wickham,

21118
05:45:09,500 --> 05:45:10,160
who left the place

21119
05:45:10,160 --> 05:45:11,360
immediately,

21120
05:45:11,840 --> 05:45:12,300
and Mrs.

21121
05:45:12,300 --> 05:45:12,720
Young was,

21122
05:45:12,720 --> 05:45:13,160
of course,

21123
05:45:13,160 --> 05:45:14,360
removed from her charge.

21124
05:45:15,480 --> 05:45:15,840
Mr.

21125
05:45:15,840 --> 05:45:16,560
Wickham's chief

21126
05:45:16,560 --> 05:45:16,920
object

21127
05:45:16,920 --> 05:45:18,120
was unquestionably

21128
05:45:18,200 --> 05:45:19,440
my sister's fortune,

21129
05:45:19,980 --> 05:45:21,600
which is ?30,000.

21130
05:45:22,140 --> 05:45:22,920
But I cannot help

21131
05:45:22,920 --> 05:45:23,600
supposing that

21132
05:45:23,600 --> 05:45:24,540
the hope of revenge

21133
05:45:24,540 --> 05:45:25,440
ing himself on me

21134
05:45:25,440 --> 05:45:26,760
was a strong inducement.

21135
05:45:27,380 --> 05:45:28,040
His revenge

21136
05:45:28,040 --> 05:45:28,280
would have

21137
05:45:28,280 --> 05:45:28,860
been complete.

21138
05:45:28,860 --> 05:45:30,060
Indeed.

21139
05:45:31,440 --> 05:45:32,480
This, Madam,

21140
05:45:32,480 --> 05:45:33,300
is a faithful

21141
05:45:33,300 --> 05:45:34,560
narrative of every event

21142
05:45:34,560 --> 05:45:35,220
in which we have been

21143
05:45:35,220 --> 05:45:36,080
concerned together.

21144
05:45:37,340 --> 05:45:37,860
And if you do

21145
05:45:37,860 --> 05:45:38,840
not absolutely reject

21146
05:45:38,840 --> 05:45:40,040
it is false.

21147
05:45:40,380 --> 05:45:41,660
You, I hope, equip me

21148
05:45:41,660 --> 05:45:42,780
henceforth of cruelty

21149
05:45:42,780 --> 05:45:43,400
towards Mr.

21150
05:45:43,400 --> 05:45:44,600
Wickham.

21151
05:45:45,680 --> 05:45:46,020
I know

21152
05:45:46,020 --> 05:45:47,360
not in what manner under

21153
05:45:47,360 --> 05:45:48,440
what form of falsehood

21154
05:45:48,440 --> 05:45:49,640
he has imposed on you,

21155
05:45:50,960 --> 05:45:52,080
but his success is not

21156
05:45:52,080 --> 05:45:52,620
perhaps to be

21157
05:45:52,620 --> 05:45:53,820
wondered it

21158
05:45:54,240 --> 05:45:55,040
ignorant as you

21159
05:45:55,040 --> 05:45:55,880
previously were,

21160
05:45:55,880 --> 05:45:56,540
of everything

21161
05:45:56,540 --> 05:45:57,740
concerning either

21162
05:45:58,040 --> 05:45:58,940
detection could not

21163
05:45:58,940 --> 05:46:00,140
be in your power

21164
05:46:00,260 --> 05:46:01,400
and suspicion, certainly

21165
05:46:01,400 --> 05:46:02,600
not in your inclination.

21166
05:46:05,160 --> 05:46:06,200
You may possibly wonder

21167
05:46:06,200 --> 05:46:06,860
why all this was

21168
05:46:06,860 --> 05:46:08,060
not told you last night,

21169
05:46:10,340 --> 05:46:10,880
but I was not

21170
05:46:10,880 --> 05:46:11,420
then muster

21171
05:46:11,420 --> 05:46:12,200
enough of myself

21172
05:46:12,200 --> 05:46:13,040
to know what could

21173
05:46:13,040 --> 05:46:14,240
or ought to be revealed

21174
05:46:15,900 --> 05:46:16,440
for the truth

21175
05:46:16,440 --> 05:46:16,920
of everything

21176
05:46:16,920 --> 05:46:18,120
here related.

21177
05:46:18,120 --> 05:46:19,080
I can appeal more

21178
05:46:19,080 --> 05:46:19,700
particularly

21179
05:46:19,700 --> 05:46:20,460
to the testimony

21180
05:46:20,460 --> 05:46:21,660
of Colonel Fitzwilliam,

21181
05:46:21,720 --> 05:46:22,260
who from

21182
05:46:22,260 --> 05:46:23,400
our near relationship

21183
05:46:23,400 --> 05:46:24,780
and constant intimacy

21184
05:46:25,040 --> 05:46:26,000
and still more as one

21185
05:46:26,000 --> 05:46:26,780
of the executors

21186
05:46:26,780 --> 05:46:27,980
of my father's will,

21187
05:46:28,160 --> 05:46:29,280
has been unavoidably

21188
05:46:29,280 --> 05:46:29,820
acquainted

21189
05:46:29,820 --> 05:46:30,720
with every particular

21190
05:46:30,720 --> 05:46:31,880
of these transactions.

21191
05:46:33,300 --> 05:46:33,660
If your

21192
05:46:33,660 --> 05:46:34,400
abhorrence of me

21193
05:46:34,400 --> 05:46:34,800
should make

21194
05:46:34,800 --> 05:46:36,020
my assertions valueless,

21195
05:46:36,500 --> 05:46:37,680
you cannot be prevented

21196
05:46:37,680 --> 05:46:38,540
by the same cause

21197
05:46:38,540 --> 05:46:39,200
from confiding

21198
05:46:39,200 --> 05:46:40,400
in my cousin

21199
05:46:41,780 --> 05:46:42,660
and that there may be

21200
05:46:42,660 --> 05:46:43,380
the possibility

21201
05:46:43,380 --> 05:46:44,580
of consulting him.

21202
05:46:45,240 --> 05:46:45,960
I shall endeavor

21203
05:46:45,960 --> 05:46:47,100
to find some opportunity

21204
05:46:47,100 --> 05:46:47,960
of putting this letter

21205
05:46:47,960 --> 05:46:48,440
in your hands

21206
05:46:48,440 --> 05:46:48,860
in the course

21207
05:46:48,860 --> 05:46:50,060
of the morning.

21208
05:46:50,280 --> 05:46:51,480
I will only add.

21209
05:46:51,680 --> 05:46:52,880
God bless you.

21210
05:46:53,120 --> 05:46:53,700
Fitzwilliam

21211
05:46:53,700 --> 05:46:54,900
Darcy.

21212
05:46:57,680 --> 05:46:58,880
Chapter 36.

21213
05:47:00,180 --> 05:47:01,520
If Elizabeth, when Mr.

21214
05:47:01,520 --> 05:47:02,240
Darcy gave her

21215
05:47:02,240 --> 05:47:02,960
the letter,

21216
05:47:02,960 --> 05:47:03,840
did not expect it

21217
05:47:03,840 --> 05:47:04,320
to contain

21218
05:47:04,320 --> 05:47:05,540
a renewal of his offers.

21219
05:47:05,780 --> 05:47:06,480
She had formed

21220
05:47:06,480 --> 05:47:07,400
no expectation

21221
05:47:07,400 --> 05:47:08,640
at all of its contents,

21222
05:47:09,020 --> 05:47:10,220
but such as they were.

21223
05:47:10,340 --> 05:47:11,540
It may well be suppose

21224
05:47:11,540 --> 05:47:12,140
how eagerly

21225
05:47:12,140 --> 05:47:12,980
she went through them.

21226
05:47:12,980 --> 05:47:14,240
And what a contrary

21227
05:47:14,240 --> 05:47:15,440
a t of emotion they

21228
05:47:16,220 --> 05:47:16,940
her feelings,

21229
05:47:16,940 --> 05:47:17,540
as she read,

21230
05:47:17,540 --> 05:47:18,200
were scarcely

21231
05:47:18,200 --> 05:47:19,380
to be defined

21232
05:47:19,380 --> 05:47:20,220
with amazement.

21233
05:47:20,220 --> 05:47:20,820
Did she first

21234
05:47:20,820 --> 05:47:21,360
understand

21235
05:47:21,360 --> 05:47:21,900
that he believed

21236
05:47:21,900 --> 05:47:22,680
any apology

21237
05:47:22,680 --> 05:47:23,880
to be in his power,

21238
05:47:23,880 --> 05:47:24,840
and steadfastly

21239
05:47:24,840 --> 05:47:26,060
what she that

21240
05:47:26,060 --> 05:47:26,420
he could have

21241
05:47:26,420 --> 05:47:27,380
no explanation.

21242
05:47:27,380 --> 05:47:28,260
To give, which.

21243
05:47:28,260 --> 05:47:29,600
Suggest sense of shame

21244
05:47:29,600 --> 05:47:30,800
would not conceal

21245
05:47:31,220 --> 05:47:32,580
with a strong prejudice

21246
05:47:32,580 --> 05:47:33,420
against everything

21247
05:47:33,420 --> 05:47:34,500
he might say.

21248
05:47:34,500 --> 05:47:35,580
She began his account

21249
05:47:35,580 --> 05:47:36,300
of what had happened

21250
05:47:36,300 --> 05:47:37,500
at another field.

21251
05:47:37,640 --> 05:47:38,280
She read with

21252
05:47:38,280 --> 05:47:38,880
an eagerness

21253
05:47:38,880 --> 05:47:39,660
which hardly left

21254
05:47:39,660 --> 05:47:40,100
her power

21255
05:47:40,100 --> 05:47:41,280
of comprehension,

21256
05:47:41,280 --> 05:47:42,200
and from impatience

21257
05:47:42,200 --> 05:47:42,660
of knowing

21258
05:47:42,660 --> 05:47:43,620
what the next sentence

21259
05:47:43,620 --> 05:47:44,480
might bring,

21260
05:47:44,480 --> 05:47:45,300
was incapable

21261
05:47:45,300 --> 05:47:45,800
of attending

21262
05:47:45,800 --> 05:47:46,680
to the sense of the one

21263
05:47:46,680 --> 05:47:47,880
before her eyes,

21264
05:47:48,140 --> 05:47:48,980
his belief of her

21265
05:47:48,980 --> 05:47:50,240
sister's insensibility.

21266
05:47:50,240 --> 05:47:51,380
She instantly resolved

21267
05:47:51,380 --> 05:47:52,380
to be false,

21268
05:47:52,380 --> 05:47:53,040
and his account

21269
05:47:53,040 --> 05:47:53,820
of the real

21270
05:47:53,820 --> 05:47:54,960
the worst objections

21271
05:47:54,960 --> 05:47:55,740
to the match

21272
05:47:55,740 --> 05:47:56,820
made her too angry

21273
05:47:56,820 --> 05:47:57,620
to have any wish of

21274
05:47:57,620 --> 05:47:58,820
doing him justice.

21275
05:47:59,100 --> 05:47:59,880
He expressed

21276
05:47:59,880 --> 05:48:00,500
no regret

21277
05:48:00,500 --> 05:48:01,260
for what he had done,

21278
05:48:01,260 --> 05:48:02,460
which satisfied her.

21279
05:48:02,580 --> 05:48:03,300
His style was.

21280
05:48:03,300 --> 05:48:04,260
Not penitent,

21281
05:48:04,260 --> 05:48:05,280
but haughty.

21282
05:48:05,280 --> 05:48:06,500
It was all pride

21283
05:48:06,500 --> 05:48:07,440
and insolence.

21284
05:48:08,600 --> 05:48:09,120
But when this

21285
05:48:09,120 --> 05:48:09,680
subject was

21286
05:48:09,680 --> 05:48:10,220
succeeded

21287
05:48:10,220 --> 05:48:11,160
by his account of Mr.

21288
05:48:11,160 --> 05:48:12,500
Wickham, when she read

21289
05:48:12,500 --> 05:48:13,040
with somewhat

21290
05:48:13,040 --> 05:48:14,000
clearer attention

21291
05:48:14,000 --> 05:48:15,200
a relation of events.

21292
05:48:15,480 --> 05:48:15,720
If.

21293
05:48:15,720 --> 05:48:16,100
True,

21294
05:48:16,100 --> 05:48:16,800
must overthrow

21295
05:48:16,800 --> 05:48:17,520
every cherished

21296
05:48:17,520 --> 05:48:18,720
opinion of his worth,

21297
05:48:18,860 --> 05:48:19,500
and which bore

21298
05:48:19,500 --> 05:48:20,840
so alarming an affinity

21299
05:48:20,840 --> 05:48:21,300
to his own

21300
05:48:21,300 --> 05:48:22,500
history of himself.

21301
05:48:22,500 --> 05:48:23,520
Her feelings were yet

21302
05:48:23,520 --> 05:48:24,740
more acutely painful

21303
05:48:24,740 --> 05:48:25,680
and more difficult

21304
05:48:25,680 --> 05:48:26,820
of definition.

21305
05:48:26,820 --> 05:48:27,740
Astonishment,

21306
05:48:27,740 --> 05:48:28,700
apprehension,

21307
05:48:28,700 --> 05:48:29,660
and even horror

21308
05:48:29,660 --> 05:48:30,720
oppressed her.

21309
05:48:30,720 --> 05:48:31,400
She wished.

21310
05:48:31,400 --> 05:48:32,720
Discredited entirely

21311
05:48:32,900 --> 05:48:34,100
repeatedly exclaiming.

21312
05:48:34,620 --> 05:48:36,120
This must be false.

21313
05:48:36,440 --> 05:48:37,640
This cannot be.

21314
05:48:37,820 --> 05:48:38,360
This must be

21315
05:48:38,360 --> 05:48:39,920
the grossest falsehood.

21316
05:48:40,460 --> 05:48:41,300
And when she had gone

21317
05:48:41,300 --> 05:48:41,520
through the

21318
05:48:41,520 --> 05:48:42,200
whole letter,

21319
05:48:42,200 --> 05:48:42,860
the scarcely

21320
05:48:42,860 --> 05:48:43,560
knowing anything

21321
05:48:43,560 --> 05:48:44,280
of the last page,

21322
05:48:44,280 --> 05:48:45,240
or to put it

21323
05:48:45,240 --> 05:48:46,860
hastily away, protesting

21324
05:48:46,860 --> 05:48:47,280
that she would

21325
05:48:47,280 --> 05:48:48,240
not regarded,

21326
05:48:48,240 --> 05:48:48,660
that she would

21327
05:48:48,660 --> 05:48:49,860
never look in it again

21328
05:48:49,980 --> 05:48:51,120
in this perturbed state

21329
05:48:51,120 --> 05:48:52,460
of mind with thoughts

21330
05:48:52,460 --> 05:48:52,980
that could not

21331
05:48:52,980 --> 05:48:54,180
rest on anything.

21332
05:48:54,300 --> 05:48:55,500
She walked on.

21333
05:48:55,560 --> 05:48:56,760
But it would not do.

21334
05:48:56,900 --> 05:48:57,720
In half a minute,

21335
05:48:57,720 --> 05:48:58,040
the letter

21336
05:48:58,040 --> 05:48:59,240
was unfolded again

21337
05:48:59,240 --> 05:49:00,380
and collecting herself

21338
05:49:00,380 --> 05:49:01,520
as well as she could.

21339
05:49:01,520 --> 05:49:02,400
She again began

21340
05:49:02,400 --> 05:49:03,080
the mortifying

21341
05:49:03,080 --> 05:49:03,720
perusal of,

21342
05:49:03,720 --> 05:49:04,100
all that

21343
05:49:04,100 --> 05:49:05,300
related to Wickham,

21344
05:49:05,300 --> 05:49:06,360
and commanded herself

21345
05:49:06,360 --> 05:49:07,500
so far as to examine

21346
05:49:07,500 --> 05:49:07,920
the meaning

21347
05:49:07,920 --> 05:49:09,120
of every sentence.

21348
05:49:09,260 --> 05:49:09,780
The account

21349
05:49:09,780 --> 05:49:10,440
of his connection

21350
05:49:10,440 --> 05:49:11,040
with the Pemberley

21351
05:49:11,040 --> 05:49:11,480
family

21352
05:49:11,480 --> 05:49:12,540
was exactly what he had

21353
05:49:12,540 --> 05:49:13,740
related himself

21354
05:49:13,740 --> 05:49:14,660
and the kindness of the

21355
05:49:14,660 --> 05:49:15,140
late Mr.

21356
05:49:15,140 --> 05:49:15,920
Darcy.

21357
05:49:15,920 --> 05:49:16,160
Though

21358
05:49:16,160 --> 05:49:17,160
she had not before known

21359
05:49:17,160 --> 05:49:18,480
its extent, agreed

21360
05:49:18,480 --> 05:49:19,100
equally well

21361
05:49:19,100 --> 05:49:20,300
with his own words

21362
05:49:20,540 --> 05:49:21,240
so far,

21363
05:49:21,240 --> 05:49:21,960
each recital

21364
05:49:21,960 --> 05:49:23,160
confirmed the other.

21365
05:49:23,160 --> 05:49:23,880
But she came

21366
05:49:23,880 --> 05:49:24,720
to the will.

21367
05:49:24,720 --> 05:49:25,380
The difference

21368
05:49:25,380 --> 05:49:26,340
was great.

21369
05:49:26,340 --> 05:49:27,140
What Wickham had.

21370
05:49:27,140 --> 05:49:27,960
Said of the living

21371
05:49:27,960 --> 05:49:29,160
was fresh in her memory,

21372
05:49:29,300 --> 05:49:30,200
and as she recalled

21373
05:49:30,200 --> 05:49:31,340
his very words,

21374
05:49:31,340 --> 05:49:32,220
it was impossible

21375
05:49:32,220 --> 05:49:32,840
not to feel that

21376
05:49:32,840 --> 05:49:34,040
there was duplicity

21377
05:49:34,040 --> 05:49:34,640
on one side

21378
05:49:34,640 --> 05:49:35,640
or the other.

21379
05:49:35,640 --> 05:49:36,620
And for a few moments

21380
05:49:36,620 --> 05:49:37,500
she flattered herself

21381
05:49:37,500 --> 05:49:38,060
that her wishes

21382
05:49:38,060 --> 05:49:39,060
did not her.

21383
05:49:39,060 --> 05:49:40,100
But when she read

21384
05:49:40,100 --> 05:49:40,820
and reread

21385
05:49:40,820 --> 05:49:41,040
with the

21386
05:49:41,040 --> 05:49:42,240
closest attention,

21387
05:49:42,300 --> 05:49:43,140
the particulars

21388
05:49:43,140 --> 05:49:43,640
immediately

21389
05:49:43,640 --> 05:49:44,540
following of Wickham's

21390
05:49:44,540 --> 05:49:45,680
resigning all pretenses

21391
05:49:45,680 --> 05:49:46,500
to the living

21392
05:49:46,500 --> 05:49:47,660
of his receiving in lieu

21393
05:49:47,660 --> 05:49:48,320
so considerable

21394
05:49:48,320 --> 05:49:49,880
a sum as ?3,000.

21395
05:49:50,180 --> 05:49:51,300
Again, was she forced.

21396
05:49:51,300 --> 05:49:52,440
To hesitate?

21397
05:49:52,440 --> 05:49:53,660
She put down the letter,

21398
05:49:53,840 --> 05:49:54,260
weighed

21399
05:49:54,260 --> 05:49:55,320
every circumstance

21400
05:49:55,320 --> 05:49:55,980
with what she meant

21401
05:49:55,980 --> 05:49:57,200
to be impartiality

21402
05:49:57,440 --> 05:49:58,140
deliberated

21403
05:49:58,140 --> 05:49:58,940
on the probability

21404
05:49:58,940 --> 05:50:00,060
of each statement,

21405
05:50:00,060 --> 05:50:01,440
but with little success

21406
05:50:01,880 --> 05:50:02,900
on both sides,

21407
05:50:02,900 --> 05:50:04,100
it was only assertion.

21408
05:50:04,440 --> 05:50:05,640
Again, she read on.

21409
05:50:05,720 --> 05:50:06,920
But every line proved

21410
05:50:06,920 --> 05:50:07,680
more clearly

21411
05:50:07,680 --> 05:50:09,060
that the affair which

21412
05:50:09,060 --> 05:50:09,740
she had believed it

21413
05:50:09,740 --> 05:50:10,380
impossible

21414
05:50:10,380 --> 05:50:11,300
that any contrivance

21415
05:50:11,300 --> 05:50:12,120
could so represent

21416
05:50:12,120 --> 05:50:13,260
as to render Mr.

21417
05:50:13,260 --> 05:50:14,000
conduct in it

21418
05:50:14,000 --> 05:50:15,200
less than infamous,

21419
05:50:15,320 --> 05:50:16,440
was capable of a turn,

21420
05:50:16,440 --> 05:50:16,860
which must

21421
05:50:16,860 --> 05:50:17,160
make him

21422
05:50:17,160 --> 05:50:18,300
entirely blameless

21423
05:50:18,300 --> 05:50:19,140
throughout the whole.

21424
05:50:20,100 --> 05:50:21,200
The extravagance and.

21425
05:50:21,200 --> 05:50:22,320
General profligacy

21426
05:50:22,320 --> 05:50:23,580
which he not to lay

21427
05:50:23,580 --> 05:50:23,900
at Mr.

21428
05:50:23,900 --> 05:50:24,960
Wickham's charge,

21429
05:50:24,960 --> 05:50:26,220
exceedingly shocked her,

21430
05:50:26,520 --> 05:50:26,940
the more

21431
05:50:26,940 --> 05:50:27,620
so as she could

21432
05:50:27,620 --> 05:50:28,280
bring no proof

21433
05:50:28,280 --> 05:50:29,480
of its injustice.

21434
05:50:29,640 --> 05:50:30,440
She had never heard

21435
05:50:30,440 --> 05:50:30,620
of him

21436
05:50:30,620 --> 05:50:31,440
before his entrance

21437
05:50:31,440 --> 05:50:32,640
into the blank militia.

21438
05:50:32,660 --> 05:50:33,180
In which.

21439
05:50:33,180 --> 05:50:34,020
He had engaged

21440
05:50:34,020 --> 05:50:34,760
at the persuasion

21441
05:50:34,760 --> 05:50:35,960
of the young man who,

21442
05:50:36,120 --> 05:50:36,720
on meeting him

21443
05:50:36,720 --> 05:50:37,920
accidentally in town,

21444
05:50:38,040 --> 05:50:38,460
had there

21445
05:50:38,460 --> 05:50:38,820
renewed a

21446
05:50:38,820 --> 05:50:40,020
slight acquaintance

21447
05:50:40,080 --> 05:50:40,760
of his former

21448
05:50:40,760 --> 05:50:41,340
way of life,

21449
05:50:41,340 --> 05:50:41,960
I think had been known

21450
05:50:41,960 --> 05:50:42,740
in Hertfordshire.

21451
05:50:42,740 --> 05:50:43,940
What he told himself

21452
05:50:44,220 --> 05:50:45,000
as to his real

21453
05:50:45,000 --> 05:50:45,740
character

21454
05:50:45,740 --> 05:50:46,560
had information

21455
05:50:46,560 --> 05:50:47,580
been in her power.

21456
05:50:47,580 --> 05:50:48,320
She had never felt

21457
05:50:48,320 --> 05:50:49,520
a wish of inquiring.

21458
05:50:49,760 --> 05:50:51,120
His countenance, voice

21459
05:50:51,120 --> 05:50:51,620
and manner

21460
05:50:51,620 --> 05:50:52,400
had established him

21461
05:50:52,400 --> 05:50:52,880
at once

21462
05:50:52,880 --> 05:50:53,480
in the possession

21463
05:50:53,480 --> 05:50:54,680
of every virtue.

21464
05:50:54,920 --> 05:50:56,000
She tried to recollect

21465
05:50:56,000 --> 05:50:56,720
some instance

21466
05:50:56,720 --> 05:50:57,540
of goodness,

21467
05:50:57,540 --> 05:50:58,580
some undistinguished

21468
05:50:58,580 --> 05:50:59,660
trait of integrity

21469
05:50:59,660 --> 05:51:00,620
or benevolence

21470
05:51:00,620 --> 05:51:01,580
that might rescue him

21471
05:51:01,580 --> 05:51:02,580
from the attacks of Mr.

21472
05:51:02,580 --> 05:51:04,140
Darcy, or at least

21473
05:51:04,140 --> 05:51:04,980
by the predominance

21474
05:51:04,980 --> 05:51:06,300
of virtue, atone

21475
05:51:06,300 --> 05:51:07,520
for those casual errors

21476
05:51:07,520 --> 05:51:08,000
under which

21477
05:51:08,000 --> 05:51:08,700
she would endeavor

21478
05:51:08,700 --> 05:51:09,480
to class what Mr.

21479
05:51:09,480 --> 05:51:10,680
Darcy had described

21480
05:51:10,740 --> 05:51:12,180
as the idleness and vice

21481
05:51:12,260 --> 05:51:13,460
many years continuance.

21482
05:51:14,000 --> 05:51:15,620
But no such recollection

21483
05:51:15,620 --> 05:51:16,820
befriended her.

21484
05:51:16,820 --> 05:51:17,460
She could see

21485
05:51:17,460 --> 05:51:18,780
him instantly before her

21486
05:51:18,960 --> 05:51:19,980
and every charm of

21487
05:51:19,980 --> 05:51:21,180
air and address.

21488
05:51:21,320 --> 05:51:22,160
But she could remember

21489
05:51:22,160 --> 05:51:23,720
no more substantial good

21490
05:51:23,900 --> 05:51:24,180
than the

21491
05:51:24,180 --> 05:51:25,140
general approbation

21492
05:51:25,140 --> 05:51:26,100
of the neighborhood

21493
05:51:26,100 --> 05:51:26,820
and the regard

21494
05:51:26,820 --> 05:51:27,920
which his social powers

21495
05:51:27,920 --> 05:51:28,520
had gained him

21496
05:51:28,520 --> 05:51:29,700
in the mess.

21497
05:51:29,700 --> 05:51:30,480
After pausing

21498
05:51:30,480 --> 05:51:31,040
on this point

21499
05:51:31,040 --> 05:51:32,240
a considerable while,

21500
05:51:32,280 --> 05:51:33,020
she once more

21501
05:51:33,020 --> 05:51:34,220
continued to read.

21502
05:51:34,500 --> 05:51:36,080
But alas, the story

21503
05:51:36,080 --> 05:51:36,920
which followed

21504
05:51:36,920 --> 05:51:37,860
of his designs

21505
05:51:37,860 --> 05:51:39,440
on Miss Darcy received

21506
05:51:39,440 --> 05:51:40,380
some confirmation

21507
05:51:40,380 --> 05:51:41,160
from what had passed

21508
05:51:41,160 --> 05:51:41,760
between Colonel

21509
05:51:41,760 --> 05:51:42,840
Fitzwilliam herself

21510
05:51:42,840 --> 05:51:44,040
only the morning before,

21511
05:51:44,340 --> 05:51:45,020
and at last

21512
05:51:45,020 --> 05:51:45,680
she was referred

21513
05:51:45,680 --> 05:51:46,220
for the truth

21514
05:51:46,220 --> 05:51:47,120
of every particular

21515
05:51:47,120 --> 05:51:47,520
to Colonel

21516
05:51:47,520 --> 05:51:48,720
Fitzwilliam himself,

21517
05:51:48,860 --> 05:51:49,400
from whom

21518
05:51:49,400 --> 05:51:49,680
she had

21519
05:51:49,680 --> 05:51:50,460
previously received

21520
05:51:50,460 --> 05:51:51,120
the information

21521
05:51:51,120 --> 05:51:52,100
of his near concern,

21522
05:51:52,100 --> 05:51:52,380
all his

21523
05:51:52,380 --> 05:51:53,540
cousin's affairs,

21524
05:51:53,540 --> 05:51:54,380
and whose character

21525
05:51:54,380 --> 05:51:54,860
she had no

21526
05:51:54,860 --> 05:51:56,060
reason to question.

21527
05:51:56,240 --> 05:51:57,180
At one time

21528
05:51:57,180 --> 05:51:58,280
she had almost resolved

21529
05:51:58,280 --> 05:51:59,420
on applying to him.

21530
05:51:59,420 --> 05:52:00,680
But the idea was checked

21531
05:52:00,680 --> 05:52:01,500
by the awkwardness

21532
05:52:01,500 --> 05:52:02,700
of application

21533
05:52:02,700 --> 05:52:03,660
and at length, wholly

21534
05:52:03,660 --> 05:52:04,280
banished by

21535
05:52:04,280 --> 05:52:05,240
the conviction that Mr.

21536
05:52:05,240 --> 05:52:05,780
Darcy would

21537
05:52:05,780 --> 05:52:06,560
never haphazard

21538
05:52:06,560 --> 05:52:07,760
in such a proposal.

21539
05:52:07,760 --> 05:52:08,700
If he had not been well.

21540
05:52:08,700 --> 05:52:09,740
Assured of his cousin's

21541
05:52:09,740 --> 05:52:10,940
corroboration.

21542
05:52:11,300 --> 05:52:12,440
She perfectly remembered

21543
05:52:12,440 --> 05:52:12,900
everything

21544
05:52:12,900 --> 05:52:13,500
that had passed

21545
05:52:13,500 --> 05:52:14,280
in conversation

21546
05:52:14,280 --> 05:52:14,820
between Wickham

21547
05:52:14,820 --> 05:52:15,560
and herself

21548
05:52:15,560 --> 05:52:16,560
in their first evening

21549
05:52:16,560 --> 05:52:16,880
at Mr.

21550
05:52:16,880 --> 05:52:17,240
Phillips,

21551
05:52:17,240 --> 05:52:18,300
as many of

21552
05:52:18,300 --> 05:52:19,040
his expressions

21553
05:52:19,040 --> 05:52:19,700
were still fresh

21554
05:52:19,700 --> 05:52:20,700
in her memory.

21555
05:52:20,700 --> 05:52:21,800
She Was now struck

21556
05:52:21,800 --> 05:52:22,820
with the impropriety

21557
05:52:22,820 --> 05:52:23,940
of such communications

21558
05:52:23,940 --> 05:52:24,920
to a stranger

21559
05:52:24,920 --> 05:52:25,560
and wondered

21560
05:52:25,560 --> 05:52:25,800
it had

21561
05:52:25,800 --> 05:52:27,000
escaped her before

21562
05:52:27,300 --> 05:52:28,400
she saw the delicacy

21563
05:52:28,400 --> 05:52:29,060
of putting himself

21564
05:52:29,060 --> 05:52:30,260
forward as he had done,

21565
05:52:30,380 --> 05:52:31,520
and the inconsistency

21566
05:52:31,520 --> 05:52:32,300
of his professions

21567
05:52:32,300 --> 05:52:33,500
with his conduct.

21568
05:52:33,600 --> 05:52:34,140
She remembered

21569
05:52:34,140 --> 05:52:34,800
that he had boasted

21570
05:52:34,800 --> 05:52:35,600
of having no fear

21571
05:52:35,600 --> 05:52:36,200
of seeing Mr.

21572
05:52:36,200 --> 05:52:37,340
Darcy, that Mr.

21573
05:52:37,340 --> 05:52:37,920
Darcy might

21574
05:52:37,920 --> 05:52:38,780
leave the country,

21575
05:52:38,780 --> 05:52:39,560
but that he should

21576
05:52:39,560 --> 05:52:40,760
stand his ground.

21577
05:52:40,800 --> 05:52:41,780
Yet he had avoided.

21578
05:52:41,780 --> 05:52:42,680
The Netherfield Ball

21579
05:52:42,680 --> 05:52:43,880
the very next week.

21580
05:52:44,120 --> 05:52:45,500
She remembered also that

21581
05:52:45,720 --> 05:52:46,040
till the

21582
05:52:46,040 --> 05:52:46,920
Netherfield family

21583
05:52:46,920 --> 05:52:48,120
had quitted the country,

21584
05:52:48,140 --> 05:52:49,100
he had told his story

21585
05:52:49,100 --> 05:52:50,300
to no one but herself

21586
05:52:50,640 --> 05:52:51,080
and that

21587
05:52:51,080 --> 05:52:52,280
after their removal

21588
05:52:52,280 --> 05:52:53,180
it had been everywhere

21589
05:52:53,180 --> 05:52:54,540
discussed that he had

21590
05:52:54,540 --> 05:52:55,740
then no reserves,

21591
05:52:55,740 --> 05:52:56,600
no scruples

21592
05:52:56,600 --> 05:52:57,420
in thinking Mr.

21593
05:52:57,420 --> 05:52:58,620
Darcy's character,

21594
05:52:58,640 --> 05:52:58,820
though

21595
05:52:58,820 --> 05:52:59,520
he had assured her

21596
05:52:59,520 --> 05:53:00,140
that respect

21597
05:53:00,140 --> 05:53:00,740
for the father

21598
05:53:00,740 --> 05:53:01,620
would always prevent

21599
05:53:01,620 --> 05:53:02,840
his exposing the son.

21600
05:53:03,020 --> 05:53:03,860
How differently

21601
05:53:03,860 --> 05:53:04,520
did everything

21602
05:53:04,520 --> 05:53:05,220
now appear

21603
05:53:05,220 --> 05:53:05,520
in which

21604
05:53:05,520 --> 05:53:06,720
he was concerned?

21605
05:53:06,860 --> 05:53:07,940
His attentions to Ms..

21606
05:53:07,940 --> 05:53:08,400
King were

21607
05:53:08,400 --> 05:53:09,240
now the consequence

21608
05:53:09,240 --> 05:53:09,600
of use

21609
05:53:09,600 --> 05:53:10,820
solely and hatefully.

21610
05:53:10,820 --> 05:53:11,820
Mercenary

21611
05:53:11,820 --> 05:53:12,780
and the mediocrity

21612
05:53:12,780 --> 05:53:13,500
of her fortune

21613
05:53:13,500 --> 05:53:14,360
proved no longer

21614
05:53:14,360 --> 05:53:15,020
the motivation

21615
05:53:15,020 --> 05:53:15,980
of his wishes,

21616
05:53:15,980 --> 05:53:16,860
but his eagerness

21617
05:53:16,860 --> 05:53:18,140
to grasp at anything.

21618
05:53:18,500 --> 05:53:19,940
His behavior to herself

21619
05:53:20,120 --> 05:53:21,080
now have had no

21620
05:53:21,080 --> 05:53:22,280
tolerable motive.

21621
05:53:22,380 --> 05:53:23,040
He had either

21622
05:53:23,040 --> 05:53:23,660
been deceived

21623
05:53:23,660 --> 05:53:24,120
with regard

21624
05:53:24,120 --> 05:53:25,440
to her fortune or had

21625
05:53:25,440 --> 05:53:26,220
been gratifying

21626
05:53:26,220 --> 05:53:26,880
his vanity

21627
05:53:26,880 --> 05:53:27,620
by encouraging

21628
05:53:27,620 --> 05:53:28,460
the preference

21629
05:53:28,460 --> 05:53:29,300
which she believed

21630
05:53:29,300 --> 05:53:29,760
she had

21631
05:53:29,760 --> 05:53:30,980
in cautiously shown

21632
05:53:31,280 --> 05:53:32,640
every lingering struggle

21633
05:53:32,640 --> 05:53:33,500
in his favor, grew

21634
05:53:33,500 --> 05:53:34,760
fainter and fainter

21635
05:53:35,040 --> 05:53:35,720
and in farther

21636
05:53:35,720 --> 05:53:36,720
justification of Mr.

21637
05:53:36,720 --> 05:53:37,520
Darcy.

21638
05:53:37,520 --> 05:53:38,160
She could not

21639
05:53:38,160 --> 05:53:38,900
but allow Mr.

21640
05:53:38,900 --> 05:53:39,480
Bingley,

21641
05:53:39,480 --> 05:53:40,800
when questioned by Jane,

21642
05:53:41,040 --> 05:53:42,240
had long ago asserted

21643
05:53:42,240 --> 05:53:43,020
his blameless ness

21644
05:53:43,020 --> 05:53:44,760
in the affair that proud

21645
05:53:44,760 --> 05:53:45,440
and repulsive

21646
05:53:45,440 --> 05:53:46,580
as were his manners.

21647
05:53:46,580 --> 05:53:47,340
She had never

21648
05:53:47,340 --> 05:53:48,060
in the whole course

21649
05:53:48,060 --> 05:53:49,160
of their acquaintance

21650
05:53:49,160 --> 05:53:49,880
and acquaintance,

21651
05:53:49,880 --> 05:53:50,580
which had latterly

21652
05:53:50,580 --> 05:53:50,880
brought them

21653
05:53:50,880 --> 05:53:51,800
much together

21654
05:53:51,800 --> 05:53:52,400
and given her

21655
05:53:52,400 --> 05:53:53,280
a sort of intimacy

21656
05:53:53,280 --> 05:53:54,320
with his ways.

21657
05:53:54,320 --> 05:53:55,160
Seen anything that.

21658
05:53:55,160 --> 05:53:55,760
Betrayed him

21659
05:53:55,760 --> 05:53:56,840
to be unprincipled

21660
05:53:56,840 --> 05:53:57,960
or unjust,

21661
05:53:57,960 --> 05:53:58,620
anything that

21662
05:53:58,620 --> 05:53:59,820
spoke him of

21663
05:54:00,000 --> 05:54:01,200
or immoral habits

21664
05:54:01,340 --> 05:54:01,980
that among his

21665
05:54:01,980 --> 05:54:02,760
own connections,

21666
05:54:02,760 --> 05:54:03,560
he was esteemed

21667
05:54:03,560 --> 05:54:04,520
and valued.

21668
05:54:04,520 --> 05:54:05,580
That even Wickham.

21669
05:54:05,580 --> 05:54:06,200
Had allowed him

21670
05:54:06,200 --> 05:54:07,380
married his brother

21671
05:54:07,380 --> 05:54:08,400
and that she had often

21672
05:54:08,400 --> 05:54:09,060
heard him speak

21673
05:54:09,060 --> 05:54:09,840
So affectionately

21674
05:54:09,840 --> 05:54:10,760
of his sister

21675
05:54:10,760 --> 05:54:11,940
as to prove him capable

21676
05:54:11,940 --> 05:54:13,440
of some amiable feeling

21677
05:54:13,800 --> 05:54:14,960
that had his actions

21678
05:54:14,960 --> 05:54:15,540
being what Mr.

21679
05:54:15,540 --> 05:54:15,840
Wickham

21680
05:54:15,840 --> 05:54:16,700
represented them.

21681
05:54:16,700 --> 05:54:18,060
So gross violation

21682
05:54:18,060 --> 05:54:18,920
of everything right?

21683
05:54:18,920 --> 05:54:19,680
Could have been

21684
05:54:19,680 --> 05:54:20,220
concealed from

21685
05:54:20,220 --> 05:54:21,020
the world.

21686
05:54:21,020 --> 05:54:21,860
And that friendship

21687
05:54:21,860 --> 05:54:22,560
between a person

21688
05:54:22,560 --> 05:54:23,520
capable of it

21689
05:54:23,520 --> 05:54:24,620
and such an amiable man

21690
05:54:24,620 --> 05:54:25,020
as Mr.

21691
05:54:25,020 --> 05:54:25,400
Bingley

21692
05:54:25,400 --> 05:54:26,720
was incomprehensible.

21693
05:54:27,540 --> 05:54:28,880
She grew absolutely

21694
05:54:28,880 --> 05:54:30,080
ashamed of herself,

21695
05:54:30,380 --> 05:54:31,460
of neither Darcy

21696
05:54:31,460 --> 05:54:32,520
nor Wickham.

21697
05:54:32,520 --> 05:54:33,240
Could she think

21698
05:54:33,240 --> 05:54:33,900
without feeling

21699
05:54:33,900 --> 05:54:35,060
she had been blind,

21700
05:54:35,060 --> 05:54:35,820
partial.

21701
05:54:35,820 --> 05:54:37,420
Prejudiced, absurd.

21702
05:54:38,460 --> 05:54:40,500
How have I acted?

21703
05:54:40,760 --> 05:54:41,940
She cried.

21704
05:54:41,940 --> 05:54:43,440
I, who prided myself

21705
05:54:43,440 --> 05:54:44,640
in my discernment.

21706
05:54:44,820 --> 05:54:45,300
I have.

21707
05:54:45,300 --> 05:54:46,280
Valued myself in my.

21708
05:54:46,280 --> 05:54:47,240
Abilities,

21709
05:54:47,240 --> 05:54:48,600
who have often disdained

21710
05:54:48,680 --> 05:54:49,580
generous candor

21711
05:54:49,580 --> 05:54:50,640
of my sister

21712
05:54:50,640 --> 05:54:52,040
and gratified my vanity

21713
05:54:52,040 --> 05:54:52,700
in useless

21714
05:54:52,700 --> 05:54:54,000
or claimable mistrust.

21715
05:54:54,500 --> 05:54:55,500
How humiliating

21716
05:54:55,500 --> 05:54:57,240
is this discovery yet?

21717
05:54:57,240 --> 05:54:58,760
How just a humiliation.

21718
05:54:59,400 --> 05:55:00,380
Had I been in love,

21719
05:55:00,380 --> 05:55:00,980
I could not have been

21720
05:55:00,980 --> 05:55:02,220
more wretchedly blind.

21721
05:55:02,660 --> 05:55:04,200
But vanity, not love,

21722
05:55:04,200 --> 05:55:05,400
has been mercifully

21723
05:55:05,580 --> 05:55:06,020
pleased

21724
05:55:06,020 --> 05:55:06,680
with the preference

21725
05:55:06,680 --> 05:55:07,580
of one and offended

21726
05:55:07,580 --> 05:55:08,220
by the neglect

21727
05:55:08,220 --> 05:55:08,940
of the other

21728
05:55:08,940 --> 05:55:09,740
on the very beginning

21729
05:55:09,740 --> 05:55:10,820
of our acquaintance.

21730
05:55:10,820 --> 05:55:11,680
I have courted

21731
05:55:11,680 --> 05:55:12,360
repossession

21732
05:55:12,360 --> 05:55:13,880
and ignorance and driven

21733
05:55:13,880 --> 05:55:15,120
reason away where I

21734
05:55:15,120 --> 05:55:16,320
the were concerned.

21735
05:55:16,560 --> 05:55:17,760
Till this moment

21736
05:55:17,960 --> 05:55:19,560
I never knew myself.

21737
05:55:20,700 --> 05:55:22,160
From herself to Jane.

21738
05:55:22,400 --> 05:55:23,760
From Jane to Bingley.

21739
05:55:24,080 --> 05:55:24,680
Her thoughts

21740
05:55:24,680 --> 05:55:25,340
were in a line

21741
05:55:25,340 --> 05:55:25,820
which soon

21742
05:55:25,820 --> 05:55:26,300
brought to her

21743
05:55:26,300 --> 05:55:27,300
recollections Mr.

21744
05:55:27,300 --> 05:55:28,500
Darcy's explanation

21745
05:55:29,180 --> 05:55:29,700
had appeared

21746
05:55:29,700 --> 05:55:30,900
very insufficient.

21747
05:55:30,960 --> 05:55:32,160
And she read it again

21748
05:55:32,540 --> 05:55:33,900
widely different was the

21749
05:55:33,900 --> 05:55:34,400
effect of a

21750
05:55:34,400 --> 05:55:35,420
second perusal.

21751
05:55:36,420 --> 05:55:36,960
How could she

21752
05:55:36,960 --> 05:55:37,560
deny that

21753
05:55:37,560 --> 05:55:39,000
credit to his assertions

21754
05:55:39,000 --> 05:55:40,200
in one instance,

21755
05:55:40,460 --> 05:55:41,040
which she had

21756
05:55:41,040 --> 05:55:41,600
been obliged

21757
05:55:41,600 --> 05:55:42,800
to give in the other?

21758
05:55:43,520 --> 05:55:44,540
He declared himself

21759
05:55:44,540 --> 05:55:46,040
to be totally suspicious

21760
05:55:46,040 --> 05:55:46,260
of her

21761
05:55:46,260 --> 05:55:47,460
sister's attachment,

21762
05:55:47,600 --> 05:55:48,440
and she could not,

21763
05:55:48,440 --> 05:55:48,920
remembering

21764
05:55:48,920 --> 05:55:49,560
what Charlotte's

21765
05:55:49,560 --> 05:55:50,760
opinion had always been.

21766
05:55:51,140 --> 05:55:52,140
Neither could she deny

21767
05:55:52,140 --> 05:55:52,620
the justice

21768
05:55:52,620 --> 05:55:52,820
of his

21769
05:55:52,820 --> 05:55:54,020
description of Jane.

21770
05:55:54,140 --> 05:55:54,800
She felt that

21771
05:55:54,800 --> 05:55:56,160
Jane's feelings, though

21772
05:55:56,160 --> 05:55:56,840
fervent,

21773
05:55:56,840 --> 05:55:58,040
were little displayed,

21774
05:55:58,140 --> 05:55:58,800
and that there was

21775
05:55:58,800 --> 05:56:00,080
a constant complacency

21776
05:56:00,080 --> 05:56:01,280
in her errant manner,

21777
05:56:01,280 --> 05:56:02,460
not often united

21778
05:56:02,460 --> 05:56:03,680
with great sensibility.

21779
05:56:04,200 --> 05:56:04,680
When she.

21780
05:56:04,680 --> 05:56:05,040
Came to

21781
05:56:05,040 --> 05:56:05,940
that part of the letter

21782
05:56:05,940 --> 05:56:06,740
in which her family

21783
05:56:06,740 --> 05:56:08,100
were mentioned in terms

21784
05:56:08,100 --> 05:56:09,300
of such mortifying, yet

21785
05:56:09,300 --> 05:56:10,500
merited reproach.

21786
05:56:10,700 --> 05:56:11,720
Her sense of shame

21787
05:56:11,720 --> 05:56:12,740
was severe.

21788
05:56:12,740 --> 05:56:13,440
The justice

21789
05:56:13,440 --> 05:56:14,040
of the charge

21790
05:56:14,040 --> 05:56:14,720
struck her too

21791
05:56:14,720 --> 05:56:15,960
forcibly for denial

21792
05:56:16,200 --> 05:56:17,360
and the circumstances

21793
05:56:17,360 --> 05:56:17,660
to which

21794
05:56:17,660 --> 05:56:18,380
he particularly

21795
05:56:18,380 --> 05:56:19,520
alluded as having passed

21796
05:56:19,520 --> 05:56:20,720
at the Netherfield Ball

21797
05:56:20,880 --> 05:56:21,840
and as confirming

21798
05:56:21,840 --> 05:56:22,260
all his

21799
05:56:22,260 --> 05:56:23,600
first disapprobation.

21800
05:56:23,940 --> 05:56:24,440
Could not have.

21801
05:56:24,440 --> 05:56:24,680
Made a

21802
05:56:24,680 --> 05:56:25,620
stronger impression

21803
05:56:25,620 --> 05:56:26,460
on his mind

21804
05:56:26,460 --> 05:56:27,660
than on hers.

21805
05:56:27,920 --> 05:56:28,580
The compliment

21806
05:56:28,580 --> 05:56:29,040
to herself

21807
05:56:29,040 --> 05:56:29,580
and her sister

21808
05:56:29,580 --> 05:56:30,780
was not and felt.

21809
05:56:30,840 --> 05:56:31,580
It soothed.

21810
05:56:31,580 --> 05:56:32,180
But could not

21811
05:56:32,180 --> 05:56:32,820
console her

21812
05:56:32,820 --> 05:56:33,840
for the contempt

21813
05:56:33,840 --> 05:56:34,200
which had

21814
05:56:34,200 --> 05:56:35,520
thus been self attracted

21815
05:56:35,520 --> 05:56:35,720
by the

21816
05:56:35,720 --> 05:56:36,920
rest of her family.

21817
05:56:37,080 --> 05:56:38,040
And as she considered

21818
05:56:38,040 --> 05:56:38,480
that Jane's

21819
05:56:38,480 --> 05:56:39,180
disappointment

21820
05:56:39,180 --> 05:56:39,780
had in fact

21821
05:56:39,780 --> 05:56:40,500
been the work of her

21822
05:56:40,500 --> 05:56:41,700
nearest relations

21823
05:56:41,780 --> 05:56:42,420
and reflected

21824
05:56:42,420 --> 05:56:43,140
how materially

21825
05:56:43,140 --> 05:56:43,980
the credit of both

21826
05:56:43,980 --> 05:56:45,060
must be hurt by such

21827
05:56:45,060 --> 05:56:46,380
impropriety of conduct.

21828
05:56:46,740 --> 05:56:47,880
She felt depressed

21829
05:56:47,880 --> 05:56:48,660
beyond anything

21830
05:56:48,660 --> 05:56:49,520
she had ever known

21831
05:56:49,520 --> 05:56:50,720
before.

21832
05:56:50,760 --> 05:56:51,860
After wandering along

21833
05:56:51,860 --> 05:56:53,100
the lane for 2 hours,

21834
05:56:53,240 --> 05:56:53,780
giving way

21835
05:56:53,780 --> 05:56:54,680
to every variety

21836
05:56:54,680 --> 05:56:55,460
of thought,

21837
05:56:55,460 --> 05:56:56,780
to reconsidering events,

21838
05:56:56,900 --> 05:56:57,480
determining

21839
05:56:57,480 --> 05:56:58,220
probabilities

21840
05:56:58,220 --> 05:56:59,480
and reconciling herself

21841
05:56:59,480 --> 05:57:00,600
as well as she could

21842
05:57:00,600 --> 05:57:01,820
to a change so sudden

21843
05:57:01,820 --> 05:57:03,020
and so important.

21844
05:57:03,140 --> 05:57:03,920
Fatigue and

21845
05:57:03,920 --> 05:57:04,580
a recollection

21846
05:57:04,580 --> 05:57:05,780
of her long absence

21847
05:57:05,780 --> 05:57:06,680
made at length

21848
05:57:06,680 --> 05:57:07,740
return home.

21849
05:57:07,740 --> 05:57:08,360
And she entered

21850
05:57:08,360 --> 05:57:08,780
the house

21851
05:57:08,780 --> 05:57:09,240
with the wish

21852
05:57:09,240 --> 05:57:09,720
of appearing

21853
05:57:09,720 --> 05:57:10,880
cheerful as usual,

21854
05:57:10,880 --> 05:57:11,700
and the resolution

21855
05:57:11,700 --> 05:57:12,300
of repressing

21856
05:57:12,300 --> 05:57:13,080
such reflections

21857
05:57:13,080 --> 05:57:14,340
as must make her unfit

21858
05:57:14,340 --> 05:57:15,540
for conversation.

21859
05:57:16,020 --> 05:57:16,760
She was immediately.

21860
05:57:16,760 --> 05:57:17,340
Told that

21861
05:57:17,340 --> 05:57:18,060
the two gentlemen

21862
05:57:18,060 --> 05:57:18,720
from Rosing

21863
05:57:18,720 --> 05:57:19,520
that each called

21864
05:57:19,520 --> 05:57:21,200
during her absence, Mr.

21865
05:57:21,200 --> 05:57:22,400
Darcy, only for a few

21866
05:57:22,400 --> 05:57:23,600
minutes to take leave,

21867
05:57:23,760 --> 05:57:24,080
but that

21868
05:57:24,080 --> 05:57:24,860
Colonel Fitzwilliam

21869
05:57:24,860 --> 05:57:25,380
had been sitting

21870
05:57:25,380 --> 05:57:26,580
with them least an hour,

21871
05:57:26,720 --> 05:57:27,380
hoping for her

21872
05:57:27,380 --> 05:57:28,220
return and.

21873
05:57:28,220 --> 05:57:28,640
Almost.

21874
05:57:28,640 --> 05:57:29,520
Resolving to walk

21875
05:57:29,520 --> 05:57:30,000
after her

21876
05:57:30,000 --> 05:57:31,200
till she could be found.

21877
05:57:31,440 --> 05:57:32,300
Elizabeth could,

21878
05:57:32,300 --> 05:57:33,840
but just a concern

21879
05:57:33,840 --> 05:57:34,680
in missing him.

21880
05:57:34,680 --> 05:57:36,120
She really rejoiced it.

21881
05:57:36,540 --> 05:57:37,440
Colonel Fitzwilliam

21882
05:57:37,440 --> 05:57:38,660
was no longer an object.

21883
05:57:38,960 --> 05:57:40,040
She could think only

21884
05:57:40,040 --> 05:57:40,700
of her letter.

21885
05:57:42,600 --> 05:57:43,880
Chapter 37.

21886
05:57:45,060 --> 05:57:45,440
The two

21887
05:57:45,440 --> 05:57:46,700
gentlemen left roses

21888
05:57:46,700 --> 05:57:47,660
the next morning,

21889
05:57:47,660 --> 05:57:48,200
and Mr.

21890
05:57:48,200 --> 05:57:49,160
Collins, having been

21891
05:57:49,160 --> 05:57:49,580
in, waiting

21892
05:57:49,580 --> 05:57:50,400
near the lodges

21893
05:57:50,400 --> 05:57:50,900
to make them

21894
05:57:50,900 --> 05:57:52,140
his parting obeisance,

21895
05:57:52,400 --> 05:57:53,640
was able to bring home

21896
05:57:53,640 --> 05:57:54,200
the pleasing

21897
05:57:54,200 --> 05:57:54,920
intelligence

21898
05:57:54,920 --> 05:57:55,680
of their appearing

21899
05:57:55,680 --> 05:57:56,880
in very good health

21900
05:57:56,880 --> 05:57:57,300
and in

21901
05:57:57,300 --> 05:57:58,520
as tolerable spirits

21902
05:57:58,520 --> 05:57:59,720
as could be expected

21903
05:57:59,820 --> 05:58:00,860
after the melancholy

21904
05:58:00,860 --> 05:58:01,800
seems so lately

21905
05:58:01,800 --> 05:58:02,460
gone through it

21906
05:58:02,460 --> 05:58:04,380
rose ings to rose ings.

21907
05:58:04,380 --> 05:58:05,420
He then hastened

21908
05:58:05,420 --> 05:58:06,320
to console Lady

21909
05:58:06,320 --> 05:58:06,840
Catherine

21910
05:58:06,840 --> 05:58:07,820
and her daughter,

21911
05:58:07,820 --> 05:58:08,960
and on his return

21912
05:58:08,960 --> 05:58:09,800
brought back

21913
05:58:09,800 --> 05:58:11,340
with great satisfaction

21914
05:58:11,480 --> 05:58:13,080
a message her ladyship

21915
05:58:13,280 --> 05:58:14,120
importing that

21916
05:58:14,120 --> 05:58:15,740
she felt herself so dull

21917
05:58:15,920 --> 05:58:16,580
as to make her

21918
05:58:16,580 --> 05:58:17,460
very desirous

21919
05:58:17,460 --> 05:58:18,000
of having them

21920
05:58:18,000 --> 05:58:19,200
all to dine with her.

21921
05:58:19,980 --> 05:58:20,580
Elizabeth

21922
05:58:20,580 --> 05:58:21,180
could not see

21923
05:58:21,180 --> 05:58:21,980
Lady Catherine

21924
05:58:21,980 --> 05:58:23,040
without recollecting

21925
05:58:23,040 --> 05:58:23,520
that.

21926
05:58:23,520 --> 05:58:24,720
Had she chosen it,

21927
05:58:24,900 --> 05:58:26,120
she might by this time

21928
05:58:26,120 --> 05:58:27,060
it be presented to her

21929
05:58:27,060 --> 05:58:28,260
as her future niece.

21930
05:58:28,520 --> 05:58:29,540
Nor could she think

21931
05:58:29,540 --> 05:58:30,780
without a smile of

21932
05:58:30,780 --> 05:58:31,640
what her lady ships

21933
05:58:31,640 --> 05:58:32,520
indignation

21934
05:58:32,520 --> 05:58:33,720
would have been.

21935
05:58:34,020 --> 05:58:35,400
What would she said?

21936
05:58:35,780 --> 05:58:36,920
How would she have

21937
05:58:36,920 --> 05:58:38,120
behaved?

21938
05:58:38,220 --> 05:58:39,060
Where questions

21939
05:58:39,060 --> 05:58:39,420
with which

21940
05:58:39,420 --> 05:58:40,620
she amused herself.

21941
05:58:41,280 --> 05:58:42,500
Their first subject

21942
05:58:42,500 --> 05:58:43,380
was the diminution

21943
05:58:43,380 --> 05:58:44,580
of the Rose Ings party.

21944
05:58:45,260 --> 05:58:46,700
I assure you

21945
05:58:46,700 --> 05:58:49,020
I feel it exceedingly.

21946
05:58:49,400 --> 05:58:50,600
Said Lady Catherine.

21947
05:58:51,080 --> 05:58:51,680
I believe

21948
05:58:51,680 --> 05:58:52,620
no one feels

21949
05:58:52,620 --> 05:58:53,480
the loss of friends

21950
05:58:53,480 --> 05:58:54,680
so much as I do.

21951
05:58:55,160 --> 05:58:56,720
But I am particularly

21952
05:58:56,720 --> 05:58:57,200
attached

21953
05:58:57,200 --> 05:58:58,340
to these young men

21954
05:58:58,340 --> 05:58:59,400
and know them to be

21955
05:58:59,400 --> 05:59:01,580
so much to me.

21956
05:59:01,940 --> 05:59:02,960
They were excessively

21957
05:59:02,960 --> 05:59:04,200
sorry to go, but so

21958
05:59:04,200 --> 05:59:05,400
they always are.

21959
05:59:05,700 --> 05:59:06,740
The dear Colonel

21960
05:59:06,740 --> 05:59:07,980
rallied his spirits

21961
05:59:07,980 --> 05:59:08,900
tolerably till

21962
05:59:08,900 --> 05:59:10,100
just at last,

21963
05:59:10,320 --> 05:59:11,400
but Darcy

21964
05:59:11,400 --> 05:59:12,320
seemed to feel it

21965
05:59:12,320 --> 05:59:13,760
most acutely.

21966
05:59:14,120 --> 05:59:15,320
More, I think, than

21967
05:59:15,320 --> 05:59:16,520
last year.

21968
05:59:16,880 --> 05:59:17,820
His attachment

21969
05:59:17,820 --> 05:59:19,340
to Rosing certainly

21970
05:59:19,340 --> 05:59:20,540
increases, as.

21971
05:59:21,260 --> 05:59:21,620
Mr.

21972
05:59:21,620 --> 05:59:23,040
Collins had a compliment

21973
05:59:23,240 --> 05:59:24,120
and an allusion

21974
05:59:24,120 --> 05:59:25,140
to throw in here,

21975
05:59:25,140 --> 05:59:25,500
which were

21976
05:59:25,500 --> 05:59:26,760
kindly smiled on

21977
05:59:26,760 --> 05:59:27,380
by the mother

21978
05:59:27,380 --> 05:59:28,580
and daughter.

21979
05:59:28,980 --> 05:59:30,180
Lady Catherine.

21980
05:59:30,540 --> 05:59:31,200
After dinner

21981
05:59:31,200 --> 05:59:32,040
that Miss Bennett

21982
05:59:32,040 --> 05:59:33,240
seemed out of spirits

21983
05:59:33,480 --> 05:59:34,260
and immediately

21984
05:59:34,260 --> 05:59:35,060
accounting for it

21985
05:59:35,060 --> 05:59:36,720
by herself, by supposing

21986
05:59:36,720 --> 05:59:37,140
that she did

21987
05:59:37,140 --> 05:59:37,740
not like to

21988
05:59:37,740 --> 05:59:39,140
go home again so soon.

21989
05:59:39,360 --> 05:59:40,560
She added,

21990
05:59:40,700 --> 05:59:41,480
What if that is

21991
05:59:41,480 --> 05:59:42,120
the case?

21992
05:59:42,120 --> 05:59:42,780
You must write

21993
05:59:42,780 --> 05:59:43,440
to your mother

21994
05:59:43,440 --> 05:59:44,240
and beg that you may

21995
05:59:44,240 --> 05:59:45,440
stay a little longer.

21996
05:59:45,740 --> 05:59:46,160
Mrs.

21997
05:59:46,160 --> 05:59:46,880
Collins will be

21998
05:59:46,880 --> 05:59:47,420
very glad of

21999
05:59:47,420 --> 05:59:48,940
your company, I am sure.

22000
05:59:49,820 --> 05:59:50,760
I much obliged,

22001
05:59:50,760 --> 05:59:51,320
your Ladyship,

22002
05:59:51,320 --> 05:59:51,840
for your kind

22003
05:59:51,840 --> 05:59:52,800
invitation.

22004
05:59:52,800 --> 05:59:53,240
Replied.

22005
05:59:53,240 --> 05:59:54,240
Elizabeth.

22006
05:59:54,240 --> 05:59:54,960
But it is not in

22007
05:59:54,960 --> 05:59:55,400
my power.

22008
05:59:55,400 --> 05:59:56,480
To accept. It.

22009
05:59:56,480 --> 05:59:56,960
I must.

22010
05:59:56,960 --> 05:59:57,980
Be in town next.

22011
05:59:57,980 --> 05:59:59,180
Saturday.

22012
05:59:59,420 --> 05:59:59,780
Why?

22013
05:59:59,780 --> 06:00:00,800
At that rate,

22014
06:00:00,800 --> 06:00:01,620
you will have been here

22015
06:00:01,620 --> 06:00:02,900
only six weeks.

22016
06:00:03,140 --> 06:00:04,200
I expected you

22017
06:00:04,200 --> 06:00:05,700
to stay two months.

22018
06:00:05,900 --> 06:00:06,800
I told Mrs.

22019
06:00:06,800 --> 06:00:07,580
Collins, sir,

22020
06:00:07,580 --> 06:00:08,760
before you came.

22021
06:00:08,760 --> 06:00:09,960
There can be no

22022
06:00:10,080 --> 06:00:11,520
for your going so soon.

22023
06:00:11,780 --> 06:00:12,140
Mrs.

22024
06:00:12,140 --> 06:00:12,600
Bennett

22025
06:00:12,600 --> 06:00:13,260
could certainly

22026
06:00:13,260 --> 06:00:13,920
spare you

22027
06:00:13,920 --> 06:00:15,120
for another fortnight.

22028
06:00:15,920 --> 06:00:17,360
But my father cannot.

22029
06:00:17,700 --> 06:00:18,800
He wrote last week

22030
06:00:18,800 --> 06:00:19,340
to hurry my.

22031
06:00:20,720 --> 06:00:22,340
Oh, your father, of

22032
06:00:22,340 --> 06:00:23,700
course, may spare you

22033
06:00:23,700 --> 06:00:24,900
if your mother can.

22034
06:00:25,140 --> 06:00:26,340
Daughters are never of

22035
06:00:26,340 --> 06:00:27,540
so much consequence

22036
06:00:27,540 --> 06:00:28,740
to a father.

22037
06:00:28,760 --> 06:00:29,720
And If you will stay

22038
06:00:29,720 --> 06:00:31,400
another month complete,

22039
06:00:31,640 --> 06:00:32,940
it will be in my power

22040
06:00:32,940 --> 06:00:33,680
to take one of you

22041
06:00:33,680 --> 06:00:34,880
as far as London.

22042
06:00:34,920 --> 06:00:35,880
For I am going there

22043
06:00:35,880 --> 06:00:36,920
in early June

22044
06:00:36,920 --> 06:00:37,880
for a week.

22045
06:00:37,880 --> 06:00:38,900
And as Dawson does

22046
06:00:38,900 --> 06:00:39,420
not object

22047
06:00:39,420 --> 06:00:40,620
to the British box,

22048
06:00:40,680 --> 06:00:41,100
there would be

22049
06:00:41,100 --> 06:00:41,820
very good room

22050
06:00:41,820 --> 06:00:42,840
for one of you.

22051
06:00:42,840 --> 06:00:43,680
And indeed,

22052
06:00:43,680 --> 06:00:44,340
if the weather should

22053
06:00:44,340 --> 06:00:45,540
happen to be cool.

22054
06:00:45,540 --> 06:00:46,560
I should not object

22055
06:00:46,560 --> 06:00:47,120
to taking you

22056
06:00:47,120 --> 06:00:48,300
both as you are.

22057
06:00:48,300 --> 06:00:49,700
Neither of you large.

22058
06:00:50,700 --> 06:00:51,180
You are all

22059
06:00:51,180 --> 06:00:52,380
kindness, madam.

22060
06:00:52,400 --> 06:00:52,940
But I believe

22061
06:00:52,940 --> 06:00:53,720
we must abide

22062
06:00:53,720 --> 06:00:54,920
by our original plan.

22063
06:00:55,680 --> 06:00:56,480
Lady Catherine

22064
06:00:56,480 --> 06:00:57,680
seemed resigned.

22065
06:00:57,980 --> 06:00:58,940
Mrs..

22066
06:00:58,940 --> 06:00:59,960
You must send a

22067
06:00:59,960 --> 06:01:01,160
servant with them.

22068
06:01:01,440 --> 06:01:02,060
You know,

22069
06:01:02,060 --> 06:01:03,920
I always speak my mind.

22070
06:01:03,920 --> 06:01:05,180
And I cannot bear

22071
06:01:05,220 --> 06:01:05,960
the idea of

22072
06:01:05,960 --> 06:01:06,900
two young women

22073
06:01:06,900 --> 06:01:07,380
traveling

22074
06:01:07,380 --> 06:01:08,900
post themselves.

22075
06:01:09,120 --> 06:01:10,980
It is highly improper.

22076
06:01:11,400 --> 06:01:12,780
You must contrive

22077
06:01:12,780 --> 06:01:14,040
to send somebody.

22078
06:01:14,240 --> 06:01:14,540
I have

22079
06:01:14,540 --> 06:01:15,180
the greatest

22080
06:01:15,180 --> 06:01:16,340
dislike in the world.

22081
06:01:16,340 --> 06:01:17,540
That sort of thing.

22082
06:01:17,780 --> 06:01:18,560
Young women

22083
06:01:18,560 --> 06:01:19,500
should always be

22084
06:01:19,500 --> 06:01:20,720
properly guarded

22085
06:01:20,720 --> 06:01:21,920
and attended

22086
06:01:21,920 --> 06:01:22,680
according to

22087
06:01:22,680 --> 06:01:24,180
their situation in life.

22088
06:01:24,560 --> 06:01:26,060
When my niece Georgiana

22089
06:01:26,060 --> 06:01:27,080
went to Ramsgate

22090
06:01:27,080 --> 06:01:28,220
last summer,

22091
06:01:28,220 --> 06:01:29,400
I made a point of her

22092
06:01:29,400 --> 06:01:30,900
having to spend servants

22093
06:01:30,900 --> 06:01:32,000
to go with her.

22094
06:01:32,000 --> 06:01:32,960
Miss Darcy,

22095
06:01:32,960 --> 06:01:34,260
the daughter of Mr.

22096
06:01:34,260 --> 06:01:35,600
Darcy, of Pemberley,

22097
06:01:35,600 --> 06:01:36,840
and Lady Ann,

22098
06:01:37,080 --> 06:01:38,100
could not have appeared

22099
06:01:38,100 --> 06:01:39,020
with propriety

22100
06:01:39,020 --> 06:01:40,320
in a different manner.

22101
06:01:41,000 --> 06:01:42,260
I am excessively

22102
06:01:42,260 --> 06:01:42,740
attentive

22103
06:01:42,740 --> 06:01:44,060
to all those things.

22104
06:01:44,420 --> 06:01:46,160
You must send John

22105
06:01:46,160 --> 06:01:46,640
with the young

22106
06:01:46,640 --> 06:01:47,400
lady's Mrs.

22107
06:01:47,400 --> 06:01:48,320
Collins.

22108
06:01:48,320 --> 06:01:49,500
I am glad it occurred

22109
06:01:49,500 --> 06:01:50,840
to me to mention it, for

22110
06:01:50,840 --> 06:01:51,120
it would

22111
06:01:51,120 --> 06:01:52,580
really be discreditable

22112
06:01:52,580 --> 06:01:53,180
to you

22113
06:01:53,180 --> 06:01:54,540
to let them go alone.

22114
06:01:55,460 --> 06:01:56,220
My uncle is

22115
06:01:56,220 --> 06:01:56,940
to send a servant

22116
06:01:56,940 --> 06:01:58,020
for us?

22117
06:01:58,020 --> 06:01:59,060
No.

22118
06:01:59,060 --> 06:02:00,260
Your uncle.

22119
06:02:00,420 --> 06:02:01,880
He keeps a manservant,

22120
06:02:01,880 --> 06:02:02,900
does he?

22121
06:02:02,900 --> 06:02:03,780
I am very glad

22122
06:02:03,780 --> 06:02:03,980
you have

22123
06:02:03,980 --> 06:02:04,940
somebody who thinks

22124
06:02:04,940 --> 06:02:06,140
of these things.

22125
06:02:06,500 --> 06:02:07,100
Where shall you

22126
06:02:07,100 --> 06:02:08,300
change horses?

22127
06:02:08,480 --> 06:02:09,860
No, Bromley, of course.

22128
06:02:10,100 --> 06:02:11,400
If you mention my name

22129
06:02:11,400 --> 06:02:12,080
at the bell, you

22130
06:02:12,080 --> 06:02:13,400
will be attended to.

22131
06:02:14,640 --> 06:02:15,780
Lady Catherine had many

22132
06:02:15,780 --> 06:02:17,000
other questions to ask

22133
06:02:17,000 --> 06:02:18,200
respecting their journey

22134
06:02:18,300 --> 06:02:18,900
and how she did

22135
06:02:18,900 --> 06:02:19,580
not answer them

22136
06:02:19,580 --> 06:02:20,540
all herself.

22137
06:02:20,540 --> 06:02:21,960
Attention was necessary,

22138
06:02:22,140 --> 06:02:23,220
which Elizabeth believed

22139
06:02:23,220 --> 06:02:24,420
to be lucky for her,

22140
06:02:24,540 --> 06:02:26,160
or with a mind occupied.

22141
06:02:26,340 --> 06:02:27,300
She might have forgotten

22142
06:02:27,300 --> 06:02:28,500
where she was.

22143
06:02:28,520 --> 06:02:29,180
Reflection

22144
06:02:29,180 --> 06:02:30,120
must be reserved

22145
06:02:30,120 --> 06:02:31,320
for solitary hours.

22146
06:02:31,580 --> 06:02:32,700
Whenever she was alone,

22147
06:02:32,700 --> 06:02:33,620
she gave way to it

22148
06:02:33,620 --> 06:02:34,820
as the greatest relief

22149
06:02:35,120 --> 06:02:35,840
had. Not a day.

22150
06:02:35,840 --> 06:02:36,440
Went by

22151
06:02:36,440 --> 06:02:37,740
without a solitary walk.

22152
06:02:37,940 --> 06:02:38,420
In which

22153
06:02:38,420 --> 06:02:39,380
she might indulge.

22154
06:02:39,380 --> 06:02:40,280
In all the delight

22155
06:02:40,280 --> 06:02:41,120
of unpleasant

22156
06:02:41,120 --> 06:02:42,320
recollections.

22157
06:02:42,600 --> 06:02:42,860
Mr.

22158
06:02:42,860 --> 06:02:43,740
Darcy's letter.

22159
06:02:43,740 --> 06:02:44,460
She was in a fair

22160
06:02:44,460 --> 06:02:45,020
way, soon

22161
06:02:45,020 --> 06:02:46,220
knowing by heart.

22162
06:02:46,280 --> 06:02:46,880
She studied

22163
06:02:46,880 --> 06:02:47,840
every sentence,

22164
06:02:47,840 --> 06:02:49,020
and her feelings towards

22165
06:02:49,020 --> 06:02:50,220
its writer were at times

22166
06:02:50,220 --> 06:02:51,420
wildly different.

22167
06:02:51,680 --> 06:02:52,380
When she remembered

22168
06:02:52,380 --> 06:02:52,880
the style of

22169
06:02:52,880 --> 06:02:53,660
his address,

22170
06:02:53,660 --> 06:02:54,240
she was still

22171
06:02:54,240 --> 06:02:55,440
full of indignation.

22172
06:02:55,740 --> 06:02:56,700
But when she considered

22173
06:02:56,700 --> 06:02:57,740
how unjustly she had

22174
06:02:57,740 --> 06:02:58,320
condemned

22175
06:02:58,320 --> 06:02:59,460
and upbraided him,

22176
06:02:59,460 --> 06:03:00,440
her anger was turned

22177
06:03:00,440 --> 06:03:01,640
against herself,

22178
06:03:01,740 --> 06:03:02,660
and his disappointed

22179
06:03:02,660 --> 06:03:03,560
feelings became

22180
06:03:03,560 --> 06:03:04,340
the object of.

22181
06:03:05,580 --> 06:03:06,380
His attachment.

22182
06:03:06,380 --> 06:03:06,840
Excited.

22183
06:03:06,840 --> 06:03:07,740
Gratitude.

22184
06:03:07,740 --> 06:03:08,900
His general character.

22185
06:03:08,900 --> 06:03:09,840
Respect.

22186
06:03:09,840 --> 06:03:10,280
But she could

22187
06:03:10,280 --> 06:03:11,480
not approve him.

22188
06:03:11,520 --> 06:03:12,200
Nor could she

22189
06:03:12,200 --> 06:03:13,340
for a moment, repent.

22190
06:03:13,340 --> 06:03:14,220
Her refusal

22191
06:03:14,220 --> 06:03:14,600
or feel

22192
06:03:14,600 --> 06:03:15,200
the slightest

22193
06:03:15,200 --> 06:03:16,080
inclination ever

22194
06:03:16,080 --> 06:03:17,280
to see him again

22195
06:03:17,400 --> 06:03:18,080
in her own

22196
06:03:18,080 --> 06:03:19,280
past behavior.

22197
06:03:19,340 --> 06:03:19,640
There was

22198
06:03:19,640 --> 06:03:20,700
a constant source

22199
06:03:20,700 --> 06:03:22,100
of vexation and regret,

22200
06:03:22,440 --> 06:03:23,360
and in the unhappy

22201
06:03:23,360 --> 06:03:24,600
defects of her family,

22202
06:03:24,800 --> 06:03:25,820
a subject of yet

22203
06:03:25,820 --> 06:03:27,020
heavier chagrin.

22204
06:03:27,360 --> 06:03:28,280
They were hopeless

22205
06:03:28,280 --> 06:03:29,360
of remedy.

22206
06:03:29,360 --> 06:03:30,600
Her father, contented

22207
06:03:30,600 --> 06:03:31,620
with laughing at them,

22208
06:03:31,620 --> 06:03:32,060
would never

22209
06:03:32,060 --> 06:03:32,780
exert himself

22210
06:03:32,780 --> 06:03:33,320
to restrain

22211
06:03:33,320 --> 06:03:34,380
the wild giddiness

22212
06:03:34,380 --> 06:03:34,580
of his

22213
06:03:34,580 --> 06:03:35,780
youngest daughters.

22214
06:03:36,000 --> 06:03:36,660
And her mother,

22215
06:03:36,660 --> 06:03:37,160
with manners

22216
06:03:37,160 --> 06:03:37,700
so far

22217
06:03:37,700 --> 06:03:38,780
from right herself

22218
06:03:38,780 --> 06:03:40,340
was entirely insensible

22219
06:03:40,340 --> 06:03:41,540
of the evil.

22220
06:03:41,540 --> 06:03:42,260
Elizabeth had

22221
06:03:42,260 --> 06:03:43,160
frequently united

22222
06:03:43,160 --> 06:03:44,420
with Jane in an endeavor

22223
06:03:44,420 --> 06:03:45,540
to check the imprudence

22224
06:03:45,540 --> 06:03:46,740
of Catherine and Lydia.

22225
06:03:46,980 --> 06:03:47,460
But while they

22226
06:03:47,460 --> 06:03:48,080
were supported

22227
06:03:48,080 --> 06:03:48,360
by their

22228
06:03:48,360 --> 06:03:49,560
mother's indulgence.

22229
06:03:49,580 --> 06:03:50,220
What chance.

22230
06:03:50,220 --> 06:03:50,780
Could there be of.

22231
06:03:50,780 --> 06:03:51,960
Improvement?

22232
06:03:51,960 --> 06:03:52,980
Catherine Weak

22233
06:03:52,980 --> 06:03:54,260
spirited, irritable

22234
06:03:54,420 --> 06:03:55,440
and completely under

22235
06:03:55,440 --> 06:03:56,600
Lydia's guidance,

22236
06:03:56,600 --> 06:03:56,960
had been

22237
06:03:56,960 --> 06:03:58,040
always affronted

22238
06:03:58,040 --> 06:03:59,240
by their advice.

22239
06:03:59,240 --> 06:04:00,180
And Lydia,

22240
06:04:00,180 --> 06:04:01,640
self-willed and careless

22241
06:04:01,820 --> 06:04:02,640
with scarcely

22242
06:04:02,640 --> 06:04:03,840
giving them a hearing.

22243
06:04:03,860 --> 06:04:04,860
They were ignorant,

22244
06:04:04,860 --> 06:04:06,140
idle and vain.

22245
06:04:06,600 --> 06:04:06,860
While

22246
06:04:06,860 --> 06:04:07,160
there was

22247
06:04:07,160 --> 06:04:08,240
an officer on merit

22248
06:04:08,240 --> 06:04:08,600
and they would

22249
06:04:08,600 --> 06:04:09,480
flirt with him.

22250
06:04:09,480 --> 06:04:10,500
And while Maritain

22251
06:04:10,500 --> 06:04:10,980
was within

22252
06:04:10,980 --> 06:04:12,180
a walk of Long Bourn,

22253
06:04:12,240 --> 06:04:13,220
they be going there

22254
06:04:13,220 --> 06:04:14,420
forever.

22255
06:04:14,700 --> 06:04:16,220
Anxiety on Jane's behalf

22256
06:04:16,220 --> 06:04:16,680
was another

22257
06:04:16,680 --> 06:04:17,880
prevailing concern.

22258
06:04:17,940 --> 06:04:18,380
Had Mr.

22259
06:04:18,380 --> 06:04:19,700
Darcy's explanation

22260
06:04:19,700 --> 06:04:20,700
by restoring Bingley

22261
06:04:20,700 --> 06:04:21,560
to all her former good.

22262
06:04:21,560 --> 06:04:22,800
Opinion heightened

22263
06:04:22,800 --> 06:04:23,300
the sense.

22264
06:04:23,300 --> 06:04:24,780
Of what Jane had lost.

22265
06:04:25,160 --> 06:04:26,420
His affection was proved

22266
06:04:26,420 --> 06:04:27,620
to have been sincere

22267
06:04:27,620 --> 06:04:28,500
and his conduct

22268
06:04:28,500 --> 06:04:29,700
cleared of all blame.

22269
06:04:29,940 --> 06:04:31,200
Alas, Annie could attach

22270
06:04:31,200 --> 06:04:32,000
the implicit ness

22271
06:04:32,000 --> 06:04:32,820
of his confidence

22272
06:04:32,820 --> 06:04:34,020
in his friend.

22273
06:04:34,140 --> 06:04:34,940
How grievous

22274
06:04:34,940 --> 06:04:36,020
then, was the thought

22275
06:04:36,020 --> 06:04:37,260
that of a situation

22276
06:04:37,260 --> 06:04:38,040
so desirable

22277
06:04:38,040 --> 06:04:39,140
in every respect,

22278
06:04:39,140 --> 06:04:39,860
so replete

22279
06:04:39,860 --> 06:04:40,800
with advantage,

22280
06:04:40,800 --> 06:04:41,640
so promising

22281
06:04:41,640 --> 06:04:42,440
for happiness.

22282
06:04:42,440 --> 06:04:43,940
Jane had been deprived

22283
06:04:44,120 --> 06:04:46,040
by the folly and decorum

22284
06:04:46,040 --> 06:04:47,240
of her own family.

22285
06:04:48,080 --> 06:04:48,620
When to

22286
06:04:48,620 --> 06:04:49,560
these recollections

22287
06:04:49,560 --> 06:04:50,000
was added.

22288
06:04:50,000 --> 06:04:50,600
The development

22289
06:04:50,600 --> 06:04:51,800
of Wickham's character.

22290
06:04:51,920 --> 06:04:52,940
It may be easily

22291
06:04:52,940 --> 06:04:53,540
believed that

22292
06:04:53,540 --> 06:04:54,500
the happy spirits,

22293
06:04:54,500 --> 06:04:55,200
which had seldom

22294
06:04:55,200 --> 06:04:56,400
been depressed before,

22295
06:04:56,600 --> 06:04:57,020
were now

22296
06:04:57,020 --> 06:04:58,040
so much affected

22297
06:04:58,040 --> 06:04:58,620
as to make it

22298
06:04:58,620 --> 06:04:59,600
almost impossible

22299
06:04:59,600 --> 06:05:00,180
for her to

22300
06:05:00,180 --> 06:05:01,020
appear tolerably

22301
06:05:01,020 --> 06:05:01,580
cheerful.

22302
06:05:02,880 --> 06:05:03,720
Their engagements at

22303
06:05:03,720 --> 06:05:04,620
Rose things were less

22304
06:05:04,620 --> 06:05:05,060
frequent

22305
06:05:05,060 --> 06:05:05,700
during the last

22306
06:05:05,700 --> 06:05:06,020
week of her

22307
06:05:06,020 --> 06:05:06,720
stay as they had

22308
06:05:06,720 --> 06:05:07,760
been at first.

22309
06:05:07,760 --> 06:05:08,820
The very last evening

22310
06:05:08,820 --> 06:05:09,780
was spent there.

22311
06:05:09,780 --> 06:05:10,940
At Her Ladyship again

22312
06:05:10,940 --> 06:05:11,900
inquired, minutely

22313
06:05:11,900 --> 06:05:12,680
into the particulars

22314
06:05:12,680 --> 06:05:13,620
of their journey,

22315
06:05:13,620 --> 06:05:14,700
gave them directions

22316
06:05:14,700 --> 06:05:15,320
as to the best

22317
06:05:15,320 --> 06:05:16,520
method of packing,

22318
06:05:16,560 --> 06:05:17,540
and was so urgent

22319
06:05:17,540 --> 06:05:18,320
on the necessity

22320
06:05:18,320 --> 06:05:19,260
of placing gowns

22321
06:05:19,260 --> 06:05:20,460
in the only right way

22322
06:05:20,700 --> 06:05:21,900
that Mariah herself

22323
06:05:21,900 --> 06:05:23,340
obliged on her return

22324
06:05:23,580 --> 06:05:24,740
to undo all the work

22325
06:05:24,740 --> 06:05:25,440
of the morning

22326
06:05:25,440 --> 06:05:26,000
and pack her

22327
06:05:26,000 --> 06:05:27,200
trunk afresh

22328
06:05:27,540 --> 06:05:28,620
when they parted.

22329
06:05:28,620 --> 06:05:29,520
Lady Catherine,

22330
06:05:29,520 --> 06:05:30,140
with great

22331
06:05:30,140 --> 06:05:31,080
condescension.

22332
06:05:31,080 --> 06:05:31,680
Wished them a.

22333
06:05:31,680 --> 06:05:32,400
Good journey

22334
06:05:32,400 --> 06:05:33,300
and invited them

22335
06:05:33,300 --> 06:05:34,020
to come to Hunt's

22336
06:05:34,020 --> 06:05:35,220
Fort again next year.

22337
06:05:35,460 --> 06:05:36,000
And Mr.

22338
06:05:36,000 --> 06:05:37,080
Burke exerted herself

22339
06:05:37,080 --> 06:05:38,360
so far as to curtsy

22340
06:05:38,540 --> 06:05:39,800
and hold out her hand

22341
06:05:39,800 --> 06:05:41,000
to both.

22342
06:05:42,000 --> 06:05:43,160
Chapter 38.

22343
06:05:44,420 --> 06:05:45,080
On Saturday

22344
06:05:45,080 --> 06:05:45,500
morning,

22345
06:05:45,500 --> 06:05:46,400
Elizabeth and Mr.

22346
06:05:46,400 --> 06:05:47,120
Collins met

22347
06:05:47,120 --> 06:05:47,780
for breakfast

22348
06:05:47,780 --> 06:05:48,380
a few minutes

22349
06:05:48,380 --> 06:05:49,100
before the others

22350
06:05:49,100 --> 06:05:49,940
appeared,

22351
06:05:49,940 --> 06:05:51,260
and he the opportunity

22352
06:05:51,260 --> 06:05:51,660
of paying

22353
06:05:51,660 --> 06:05:52,740
the parting civilities

22354
06:05:52,740 --> 06:05:53,000
which he

22355
06:05:53,000 --> 06:05:54,200
deemed indispensable if

22356
06:05:54,200 --> 06:05:55,400
necessary.

22357
06:05:55,700 --> 06:05:56,300
I know not,

22358
06:05:56,300 --> 06:05:57,420
Miss Elizabeth.

22359
06:05:57,420 --> 06:05:58,620
Said he.

22360
06:05:58,620 --> 06:05:59,180
Whether Mrs.

22361
06:05:59,180 --> 06:05:59,900
Collins has yet

22362
06:05:59,900 --> 06:06:00,440
expressed her

22363
06:06:00,440 --> 06:06:01,500
sense of your kindness

22364
06:06:01,500 --> 06:06:02,700
in coming to us.

22365
06:06:02,700 --> 06:06:03,620
But I am very certain

22366
06:06:03,620 --> 06:06:04,020
you will not

22367
06:06:04,020 --> 06:06:04,580
leave the house

22368
06:06:04,580 --> 06:06:05,400
without receiving her.

22369
06:06:05,400 --> 06:06:06,600
Thanks for it.

22370
06:06:07,440 --> 06:06:08,060
The favor of

22371
06:06:08,060 --> 06:06:08,660
your company

22372
06:06:08,660 --> 06:06:09,640
has been much felt.

22373
06:06:09,640 --> 06:06:10,820
I assure you.

22374
06:06:10,820 --> 06:06:11,700
We know how little

22375
06:06:11,700 --> 06:06:13,040
there is to tempt anyone

22376
06:06:13,040 --> 06:06:14,240
to our humble abode.

22377
06:06:14,720 --> 06:06:15,420
Our plain manner

22378
06:06:15,420 --> 06:06:16,080
of living,

22379
06:06:16,080 --> 06:06:17,100
our small rooms

22380
06:06:17,100 --> 06:06:18,300
and few domestics.

22381
06:06:18,600 --> 06:06:19,620
And the little we see of

22382
06:06:19,620 --> 06:06:20,400
the world

22383
06:06:20,400 --> 06:06:21,300
must make dunsford

22384
06:06:21,300 --> 06:06:22,200
extremely dull

22385
06:06:22,200 --> 06:06:22,920
to a young lady

22386
06:06:22,920 --> 06:06:24,120
like yourself.

22387
06:06:24,320 --> 06:06:24,860
But I hope you will

22388
06:06:24,860 --> 06:06:25,280
believe us.

22389
06:06:25,280 --> 06:06:25,760
Grateful

22390
06:06:25,760 --> 06:06:26,960
for the condescension

22391
06:06:27,300 --> 06:06:27,800
and that we have

22392
06:06:27,800 --> 06:06:28,380
done everything

22393
06:06:28,380 --> 06:06:28,920
in our power

22394
06:06:28,920 --> 06:06:29,880
to prevent you spending

22395
06:06:29,880 --> 06:06:31,160
your time unpleasantly.

22396
06:06:32,780 --> 06:06:33,480
Elizabeth was

22397
06:06:33,480 --> 06:06:34,040
eager with her

22398
06:06:34,040 --> 06:06:35,120
thanks and assurances

22399
06:06:35,120 --> 06:06:36,080
of happiness.

22400
06:06:36,080 --> 06:06:36,780
She had spent.

22401
06:06:36,780 --> 06:06:37,380
Six weeks

22402
06:06:37,380 --> 06:06:38,480
with great enjoyment.

22403
06:06:38,480 --> 06:06:38,780
And the.

22404
06:06:38,780 --> 06:06:39,480
Pleasure of being

22405
06:06:39,480 --> 06:06:40,340
with Charlotte

22406
06:06:40,340 --> 06:06:41,460
and the kind attention

22407
06:06:41,460 --> 06:06:42,540
she had received

22408
06:06:42,540 --> 06:06:43,620
must make her feel

22409
06:06:43,620 --> 06:06:44,700
the obliged.

22410
06:06:44,700 --> 06:06:45,020
Mr.

22411
06:06:45,020 --> 06:06:46,280
Collins was gratified

22412
06:06:46,280 --> 06:06:47,520
and with a more smiling

22413
06:06:47,520 --> 06:06:48,720
solemnity, replied.

22414
06:06:49,800 --> 06:06:50,240
It me

22415
06:06:50,240 --> 06:06:50,780
the greatest

22416
06:06:50,780 --> 06:06:51,420
pleasure to hear

22417
06:06:51,420 --> 06:06:52,100
that you have passed

22418
06:06:52,100 --> 06:06:52,620
your time

22419
06:06:52,620 --> 06:06:53,820
not disagreeable.

22420
06:06:54,060 --> 06:06:54,900
We have certainly done

22421
06:06:54,900 --> 06:06:56,420
our best and most

22422
06:06:56,420 --> 06:06:57,000
fortunately,

22423
06:06:57,000 --> 06:06:57,920
having it in our power

22424
06:06:57,920 --> 06:06:58,700
to introduce you

22425
06:06:58,700 --> 06:06:59,900
to very superior

22426
06:07:00,620 --> 06:07:01,680
and from our connection

22427
06:07:01,680 --> 06:07:02,720
with Rose things,

22428
06:07:02,720 --> 06:07:03,560
the frequent means

22429
06:07:03,560 --> 06:07:04,100
of varying

22430
06:07:04,100 --> 06:07:05,300
the humble home scene.

22431
06:07:05,540 --> 06:07:06,560
I think we may flatter

22432
06:07:06,560 --> 06:07:07,080
ourselves

22433
06:07:07,080 --> 06:07:07,760
that your Hansford

22434
06:07:07,760 --> 06:07:08,360
visit cannot

22435
06:07:08,360 --> 06:07:08,720
have been

22436
06:07:08,720 --> 06:07:09,920
entirely irksome.

22437
06:07:10,760 --> 06:07:11,540
Our situation

22438
06:07:11,540 --> 06:07:12,360
with regard to Lady

22439
06:07:12,360 --> 06:07:12,780
Katharine's

22440
06:07:12,780 --> 06:07:14,340
family is indeed

22441
06:07:14,880 --> 06:07:15,360
the sort

22442
06:07:15,360 --> 06:07:16,080
of extraordinary

22443
06:07:16,080 --> 06:07:16,740
advantage and

22444
06:07:16,740 --> 06:07:17,340
blessing which

22445
06:07:17,340 --> 06:07:18,260
few can boast.

22446
06:07:19,340 --> 06:07:19,760
You see on

22447
06:07:19,760 --> 06:07:20,960
what a footing we are,

22448
06:07:21,080 --> 06:07:22,140
you see how continually

22449
06:07:22,140 --> 06:07:23,340
we are engaged there.

22450
06:07:24,360 --> 06:07:24,920
In truth,

22451
06:07:24,920 --> 06:07:26,120
I must acknowledge that

22452
06:07:26,760 --> 06:07:27,120
with all

22453
06:07:27,120 --> 06:07:27,980
the disadvantages

22454
06:07:27,980 --> 06:07:28,380
of this

22455
06:07:28,380 --> 06:07:29,580
humble parsonage,

22456
06:07:29,900 --> 06:07:30,720
I should not think

22457
06:07:30,720 --> 06:07:31,640
anyone abiding in

22458
06:07:31,640 --> 06:07:32,340
it is an object

22459
06:07:32,340 --> 06:07:33,540
of compassion

22460
06:07:34,880 --> 06:07:35,780
while they are sharers

22461
06:07:35,780 --> 06:07:36,540
of our intimacy,

22462
06:07:36,540 --> 06:07:37,740
it rose King's.

22463
06:07:38,720 --> 06:07:39,920
Words were insufficient

22464
06:07:39,920 --> 06:07:40,740
for the elevation

22465
06:07:40,740 --> 06:07:41,720
of his feelings,

22466
06:07:41,720 --> 06:07:42,540
and he was obliged

22467
06:07:42,540 --> 06:07:43,740
to walk about the room

22468
06:07:43,740 --> 06:07:44,720
while Elizabeth tried

22469
06:07:44,720 --> 06:07:45,680
to unite civility

22470
06:07:45,680 --> 06:07:46,920
and truth in a few short

22471
06:07:46,920 --> 06:07:48,120
sentences.

22472
06:07:48,680 --> 06:07:49,080
You may,

22473
06:07:49,080 --> 06:07:49,800
in fact, carry

22474
06:07:49,800 --> 06:07:50,660
a very favorable

22475
06:07:50,660 --> 06:07:51,360
report of us

22476
06:07:51,360 --> 06:07:52,100
into Hertfordshire.

22477
06:07:52,100 --> 06:07:53,300
My dear cousin,

22478
06:07:53,900 --> 06:07:54,840
I flatter myself.

22479
06:07:54,840 --> 06:07:55,140
At least

22480
06:07:55,140 --> 06:07:55,820
that you will be able

22481
06:07:55,820 --> 06:07:57,020
to do so.

22482
06:07:57,660 --> 06:07:58,500
Lady Katherine's

22483
06:07:58,500 --> 06:07:59,600
great attentions to Mrs.

22484
06:07:59,600 --> 06:08:00,080
Collins.

22485
06:08:00,080 --> 06:08:00,900
You have been a daily

22486
06:08:00,900 --> 06:08:02,100
witness of

22487
06:08:02,340 --> 06:08:03,600
and altogether, I trust

22488
06:08:03,600 --> 06:08:04,260
it does not appear

22489
06:08:04,260 --> 06:08:05,000
that your friend has

22490
06:08:05,000 --> 06:08:06,540
drawn an unfortunate.

22491
06:08:07,500 --> 06:08:07,980
But on this

22492
06:08:07,980 --> 06:08:08,580
point it will be

22493
06:08:08,580 --> 06:08:10,640
as well Be silent only.

22494
06:08:10,640 --> 06:08:11,360
Let me assure you,

22495
06:08:11,360 --> 06:08:12,560
my dear Miss Elizabeth,

22496
06:08:13,040 --> 06:08:13,800
that I can from

22497
06:08:13,800 --> 06:08:14,340
my heart

22498
06:08:14,340 --> 06:08:15,300
most cordially wish

22499
06:08:15,300 --> 06:08:16,500
you equal Felicity

22500
06:08:16,500 --> 06:08:17,700
in marriage.

22501
06:08:18,440 --> 06:08:18,920
My Dear

22502
06:08:18,920 --> 06:08:19,760
Charlotte and I have

22503
06:08:19,760 --> 06:08:20,540
but one mind

22504
06:08:20,540 --> 06:08:21,740
and one way of thinking.

22505
06:08:23,100 --> 06:08:23,460
There is,

22506
06:08:23,460 --> 06:08:24,060
in everything,

22507
06:08:24,060 --> 06:08:24,840
a most remarkable

22508
06:08:24,840 --> 06:08:25,880
resemblance of character

22509
06:08:25,880 --> 06:08:27,080
and ideas between us.

22510
06:08:28,500 --> 06:08:28,920
We seem

22511
06:08:28,920 --> 06:08:29,660
to have been designed

22512
06:08:29,660 --> 06:08:30,860
for each other.

22513
06:08:31,860 --> 06:08:32,540
Elizabeth could

22514
06:08:32,540 --> 06:08:33,240
safely say

22515
06:08:33,240 --> 06:08:33,600
that it was a

22516
06:08:33,600 --> 06:08:34,440
great happiness

22517
06:08:34,440 --> 06:08:34,740
where that.

22518
06:08:34,740 --> 06:08:35,600
Was the case

22519
06:08:35,600 --> 06:08:36,200
and with equal.

22520
06:08:36,200 --> 06:08:37,400
Sincerity, could add

22521
06:08:37,580 --> 06:08:38,300
that she firmly.

22522
06:08:38,300 --> 06:08:39,500
Believed and rejoiced.

22523
06:08:39,500 --> 06:08:39,780
In his

22524
06:08:39,780 --> 06:08:40,980
domestic comforts.

22525
06:08:41,420 --> 06:08:42,480
She was not sorry,

22526
06:08:42,480 --> 06:08:43,040
however, to have

22527
06:08:43,040 --> 06:08:43,920
the recital of them

22528
06:08:43,920 --> 06:08:45,020
interrupted by the lady

22529
06:08:45,020 --> 06:08:46,220
from whom they sprang.

22530
06:08:46,680 --> 06:08:47,820
Poor Charlotte.

22531
06:08:47,820 --> 06:08:48,140
It was.

22532
06:08:48,140 --> 06:08:48,780
Melancholy

22533
06:08:48,780 --> 06:08:49,680
to leave her to such.

22534
06:08:49,680 --> 06:08:50,820
Society.

22535
06:08:50,820 --> 06:08:51,780
But she had chosen. It

22536
06:08:51,780 --> 06:08:52,940
with her eyes open.

22537
06:08:52,940 --> 06:08:53,220
And.

22538
06:08:53,220 --> 06:08:53,400
Though

22539
06:08:53,400 --> 06:08:54,380
evidently regretting

22540
06:08:54,380 --> 06:08:55,140
that her visitors were.

22541
06:08:55,140 --> 06:08:56,580
To go, she did not seem.

22542
06:08:56,580 --> 06:08:57,860
To ask for compassion.

22543
06:08:58,320 --> 06:08:58,860
Her home

22544
06:08:58,860 --> 06:08:59,060
and her

22545
06:08:59,060 --> 06:09:00,600
housekeeping, her parish

22546
06:09:00,600 --> 06:09:01,500
and her poultry

22547
06:09:01,500 --> 06:09:02,600
and all their dependent

22548
06:09:02,600 --> 06:09:03,540
concerns.

22549
06:09:03,540 --> 06:09:04,380
Had not yet.

22550
06:09:04,380 --> 06:09:05,760
Lost their charms.

22551
06:09:06,840 --> 06:09:07,560
At length, the

22552
06:09:07,560 --> 06:09:08,340
chairs arrived.

22553
06:09:08,340 --> 06:09:09,000
The trunks were

22554
06:09:09,000 --> 06:09:10,520
fastened on the parcels

22555
06:09:10,520 --> 06:09:11,480
placed within,

22556
06:09:11,480 --> 06:09:12,360
and it was pronounced

22557
06:09:12,360 --> 06:09:13,440
to be ready

22558
06:09:13,440 --> 06:09:14,540
after an affectionate

22559
06:09:14,540 --> 06:09:15,260
parting between

22560
06:09:15,260 --> 06:09:16,040
the friends.

22561
06:09:16,040 --> 06:09:17,120
Elizabeth was attended

22562
06:09:17,120 --> 06:09:18,180
to the carriage by Mr.

22563
06:09:18,180 --> 06:09:18,960
Collins,

22564
06:09:18,960 --> 06:09:20,040
and as they walked down

22565
06:09:20,040 --> 06:09:20,540
the garden,

22566
06:09:20,540 --> 06:09:21,480
he was commissioning her

22567
06:09:21,480 --> 06:09:22,560
with his best respects

22568
06:09:22,560 --> 06:09:23,760
to all her family,

22569
06:09:23,840 --> 06:09:24,720
not forgetting his

22570
06:09:24,720 --> 06:09:25,860
thanks for the kindness

22571
06:09:25,860 --> 06:09:26,580
he had received

22572
06:09:26,580 --> 06:09:27,780
long in the winter

22573
06:09:27,860 --> 06:09:28,860
and his compliments

22574
06:09:28,860 --> 06:09:29,700
to Mr. and Mrs.

22575
06:09:29,700 --> 06:09:31,020
Gardner, though unknown.

22576
06:09:31,440 --> 06:09:32,660
He then handed her in.

22577
06:09:32,720 --> 06:09:33,900
Maria followed

22578
06:09:33,900 --> 06:09:34,400
and the door

22579
06:09:34,400 --> 06:09:34,920
was on the point

22580
06:09:34,920 --> 06:09:35,960
of being closed.

22581
06:09:35,960 --> 06:09:36,120
When.

22582
06:09:36,120 --> 06:09:36,560
He suddenly

22583
06:09:36,560 --> 06:09:37,800
reminded them with some.

22584
06:09:37,800 --> 06:09:38,700
Consternation,

22585
06:09:38,700 --> 06:09:39,020
that they.

22586
06:09:39,020 --> 06:09:39,540
Had hitherto

22587
06:09:39,540 --> 06:09:40,460
forgotten to leave

22588
06:09:40,460 --> 06:09:41,220
any message

22589
06:09:41,220 --> 06:09:41,880
for the ladies

22590
06:09:41,880 --> 06:09:42,920
at Rosen's.

22591
06:09:42,920 --> 06:09:44,120
But he added.

22592
06:09:44,420 --> 06:09:44,760
You will,

22593
06:09:44,760 --> 06:09:45,080
of course,

22594
06:09:45,080 --> 06:09:45,620
wish to have

22595
06:09:45,620 --> 06:09:46,820
your humble respects

22596
06:09:47,180 --> 06:09:47,820
to them

22597
06:09:47,820 --> 06:09:48,620
with your grateful

22598
06:09:48,620 --> 06:09:49,280
thanks for their

22599
06:09:49,280 --> 06:09:50,540
kindness to you while

22600
06:09:50,540 --> 06:09:51,300
you have been here.

22601
06:09:52,440 --> 06:09:53,120
Elizabeth made

22602
06:09:53,120 --> 06:09:54,120
no objection.

22603
06:09:54,120 --> 06:09:54,660
The door was

22604
06:09:54,660 --> 06:09:55,640
then allowed to be shut

22605
06:09:55,640 --> 06:09:56,340
and the carriage

22606
06:09:56,340 --> 06:09:57,540
drove off.

22607
06:09:57,780 --> 06:09:59,040
Good gracious!

22608
06:09:59,360 --> 06:10:00,120
Cried Maria,

22609
06:10:00,120 --> 06:10:00,660
after a few

22610
06:10:00,660 --> 06:10:01,860
minute's silence.

22611
06:10:01,920 --> 06:10:02,420
It seems,

22612
06:10:02,420 --> 06:10:03,360
but a day or two

22613
06:10:03,360 --> 06:10:04,560
since we first came.

22614
06:10:04,580 --> 06:10:05,660
And yet how many things

22615
06:10:05,660 --> 06:10:06,860
have happened?

22616
06:10:07,140 --> 06:10:08,760
A great many indeed.

22617
06:10:09,000 --> 06:10:09,860
Said her companion

22618
06:10:09,860 --> 06:10:11,060
with a sigh.

22619
06:10:11,160 --> 06:10:11,840
We have died

22620
06:10:11,840 --> 06:10:13,320
nine times at roses.

22621
06:10:13,320 --> 06:10:14,240
Besides drinking tea.

22622
06:10:14,240 --> 06:10:15,360
That twice.

22623
06:10:15,360 --> 06:10:15,900
How much?

22624
06:10:15,900 --> 06:10:17,100
I shall to tell.

22625
06:10:17,540 --> 06:10:18,120
Elizabeth

22626
06:10:18,120 --> 06:10:19,320
added privately,

22627
06:10:19,520 --> 06:10:20,340
and how much

22628
06:10:20,340 --> 06:10:21,860
I shall have to conceal.

22629
06:10:23,060 --> 06:10:23,600
Their journey

22630
06:10:23,600 --> 06:10:24,200
was performed

22631
06:10:24,200 --> 06:10:24,720
without much

22632
06:10:24,720 --> 06:10:25,460
conversation

22633
06:10:25,460 --> 06:10:26,460
or any alarm.

22634
06:10:26,460 --> 06:10:27,540
And within 4 hours

22635
06:10:27,540 --> 06:10:28,040
of their leading

22636
06:10:28,040 --> 06:10:28,760
Hunt's herd,

22637
06:10:28,760 --> 06:10:29,520
they reached Mr.

22638
06:10:29,520 --> 06:10:30,500
Gardiner's house,

22639
06:10:30,500 --> 06:10:30,980
where they were

22640
06:10:30,980 --> 06:10:32,180
to remain a few days.

22641
06:10:32,780 --> 06:10:33,420
Jane looked

22642
06:10:33,420 --> 06:10:34,740
well and Elizabeth

22643
06:10:34,740 --> 06:10:35,940
had little opportunity

22644
06:10:35,940 --> 06:10:37,140
studying her spirits

22645
06:10:37,220 --> 06:10:37,800
amidst the

22646
06:10:37,800 --> 06:10:38,940
various engagements

22647
06:10:38,940 --> 06:10:39,740
which the kindness of

22648
06:10:39,740 --> 06:10:40,200
her aunt

22649
06:10:40,200 --> 06:10:41,400
had preserved for them.

22650
06:10:41,480 --> 06:10:42,620
But Jane was to go home

22651
06:10:42,620 --> 06:10:43,200
with her,

22652
06:10:43,200 --> 06:10:44,060
and at Long Bourne,

22653
06:10:44,060 --> 06:10:44,720
there would be leisure

22654
06:10:44,720 --> 06:10:45,920
enough for observation.

22655
06:10:46,640 --> 06:10:47,240
It was not.

22656
06:10:47,240 --> 06:10:48,080
Without an effort,

22657
06:10:48,080 --> 06:10:48,540
meanwhile,

22658
06:10:48,540 --> 06:10:49,220
that she could wait

22659
06:10:49,220 --> 06:10:49,940
even for long.

22660
06:10:49,940 --> 06:10:50,780
Born before

22661
06:10:50,780 --> 06:10:51,360
she told her

22662
06:10:51,360 --> 06:10:52,100
sister of Mr.

22663
06:10:52,100 --> 06:10:53,300
Darcy's proposals.

22664
06:10:53,760 --> 06:10:54,240
To know.

22665
06:10:54,240 --> 06:10:54,620
That she had

22666
06:10:54,620 --> 06:10:55,640
the power of revealing

22667
06:10:55,640 --> 06:10:55,920
what would

22668
06:10:55,920 --> 06:10:56,760
so exceedingly

22669
06:10:56,760 --> 06:10:57,960
astonish Jane.

22670
06:10:58,040 --> 06:10:58,700
And must.

22671
06:10:58,700 --> 06:10:59,600
At the same time

22672
06:10:59,600 --> 06:11:00,740
so highly gratify

22673
06:11:00,740 --> 06:11:01,380
whatever of her

22674
06:11:01,380 --> 06:11:02,120
own vanity.

22675
06:11:02,120 --> 06:11:02,880
She had not yet

22676
06:11:02,880 --> 06:11:04,100
been able to reason away

22677
06:11:04,560 --> 06:11:05,660
with such a temptation

22678
06:11:05,660 --> 06:11:06,900
to openness, as nothing

22679
06:11:06,900 --> 06:11:07,560
could have conquer

22680
06:11:07,560 --> 06:11:08,000
to the state

22681
06:11:08,000 --> 06:11:08,700
of indecision

22682
06:11:08,700 --> 06:11:09,360
which she remained

22683
06:11:09,360 --> 06:11:10,380
as to the extent of what

22684
06:11:10,380 --> 06:11:11,580
she should communicate

22685
06:11:11,820 --> 06:11:12,600
and her fear

22686
06:11:12,600 --> 06:11:13,440
if she once entered

22687
06:11:13,440 --> 06:11:14,420
on the subject

22688
06:11:14,420 --> 06:11:15,180
of being hurried

22689
06:11:15,180 --> 06:11:16,200
into repeating

22690
06:11:16,200 --> 06:11:17,000
of Bingley,

22691
06:11:17,000 --> 06:11:18,120
which might only grieve

22692
06:11:18,120 --> 06:11:19,160
her sister further.

22693
06:11:22,220 --> 06:11:23,420
Chapter 39.

22694
06:11:24,060 --> 06:11:24,560
It was the

22695
06:11:24,560 --> 06:11:25,260
second week in

22696
06:11:25,260 --> 06:11:26,060
May in which

22697
06:11:26,060 --> 06:11:27,060
the three young ladies

22698
06:11:27,060 --> 06:11:27,920
set out together

22699
06:11:27,920 --> 06:11:29,100
from Grace Church Street

22700
06:11:29,100 --> 06:11:30,300
for the Town of Blank

22701
06:11:30,300 --> 06:11:31,500
in.

22702
06:11:31,560 --> 06:11:32,420
And as they drew near

22703
06:11:32,420 --> 06:11:33,260
the appointed inn

22704
06:11:33,260 --> 06:11:33,660
where Mr.

22705
06:11:33,660 --> 06:11:34,380
Bennett's carriage

22706
06:11:34,380 --> 06:11:35,420
was to meet them,

22707
06:11:35,420 --> 06:11:36,600
they quickly perceived

22708
06:11:36,600 --> 06:11:37,800
in token of the coachman

22709
06:11:37,820 --> 06:11:38,940
punctuality.

22710
06:11:38,940 --> 06:11:40,140
Both Kitty and Lydia

22711
06:11:40,140 --> 06:11:40,620
looking out

22712
06:11:40,620 --> 06:11:41,100
of a dining

22713
06:11:41,100 --> 06:11:42,300
room upstairs.

22714
06:11:42,320 --> 06:11:43,200
These two girls

22715
06:11:43,200 --> 06:11:43,760
had been above

22716
06:11:43,760 --> 06:11:44,960
an hour in the place,

22717
06:11:45,060 --> 06:11:46,080
happily employed

22718
06:11:46,080 --> 06:11:46,580
in visiting

22719
06:11:46,580 --> 06:11:47,780
an opposite milliner,

22720
06:11:47,780 --> 06:11:48,800
watching the Sentinel

22721
06:11:48,800 --> 06:11:50,180
on guard and dressing

22722
06:11:50,280 --> 06:11:51,480
salad and cucumber.

22723
06:11:52,140 --> 06:11:52,940
After welcoming

22724
06:11:52,940 --> 06:11:53,760
their sisters,

22725
06:11:53,760 --> 06:11:54,480
they triumphantly

22726
06:11:54,480 --> 06:11:55,340
displayed a table

22727
06:11:55,340 --> 06:11:55,740
set out

22728
06:11:55,740 --> 06:11:56,820
with such cold meat

22729
06:11:56,820 --> 06:11:57,740
as an in larder

22730
06:11:57,740 --> 06:11:58,920
usually affords,

22731
06:11:58,920 --> 06:11:59,940
exclaiming.

22732
06:11:59,940 --> 06:12:01,140
If not, this nice.

22733
06:12:01,140 --> 06:12:01,700
Is not this

22734
06:12:01,700 --> 06:12:02,900
an agreeable surprise?

22735
06:12:03,600 --> 06:12:04,260
And we mean

22736
06:12:04,260 --> 06:12:05,460
to treat to all?

22737
06:12:05,520 --> 06:12:06,560
Added Lydia.

22738
06:12:06,560 --> 06:12:07,460
But you must lend us

22739
06:12:07,460 --> 06:12:08,040
the money.

22740
06:12:08,040 --> 06:12:09,140
We have just spent hours

22741
06:12:09,140 --> 06:12:10,340
at the shop there.

22742
06:12:10,620 --> 06:12:11,280
Then showing her

22743
06:12:11,280 --> 06:12:12,320
purchases.

22744
06:12:12,320 --> 06:12:12,780
Look here.

22745
06:12:12,780 --> 06:12:13,100
I have bought

22746
06:12:13,100 --> 06:12:13,940
this bonnet.

22747
06:12:13,940 --> 06:12:14,580
I do not think

22748
06:12:14,580 --> 06:12:15,540
it is very pretty.

22749
06:12:15,540 --> 06:12:15,900
But I thought

22750
06:12:15,900 --> 06:12:16,640
I might as well buy.

22751
06:12:16,640 --> 06:12:17,540
It is not.

22752
06:12:17,540 --> 06:12:18,660
I shall put it to pieces

22753
06:12:18,660 --> 06:12:19,740
as soon as I get home

22754
06:12:19,740 --> 06:12:20,060
and see

22755
06:12:20,060 --> 06:12:20,660
if I can make it.

22756
06:12:20,660 --> 06:12:21,860
Up any better.

22757
06:12:22,320 --> 06:12:23,280
And when her sisters

22758
06:12:23,280 --> 06:12:24,480
abused it as ugly,

22759
06:12:24,540 --> 06:12:25,140
she added

22760
06:12:25,140 --> 06:12:26,340
with perfect unconcern.

22761
06:12:26,640 --> 06:12:27,560
Oh, but they were two

22762
06:12:27,560 --> 06:12:27,960
or three

22763
06:12:27,960 --> 06:12:29,300
much uglier in the shop.

22764
06:12:29,480 --> 06:12:30,000
And when I

22765
06:12:30,000 --> 06:12:30,780
bought some prettier

22766
06:12:30,780 --> 06:12:31,400
colored satin

22767
06:12:31,400 --> 06:12:32,540
to trim it with fresh.

22768
06:12:32,540 --> 06:12:33,000
I think

22769
06:12:33,000 --> 06:12:33,240
it would be

22770
06:12:33,240 --> 06:12:34,340
very tolerable.

22771
06:12:34,340 --> 06:12:35,280
Besides, it

22772
06:12:35,280 --> 06:12:36,300
will not much signify

22773
06:12:36,300 --> 06:12:37,100
what one wears.

22774
06:12:37,100 --> 06:12:37,860
This summer.

22775
06:12:37,860 --> 06:12:38,780
After the

22776
06:12:38,780 --> 06:12:39,780
have left Merton

22777
06:12:39,780 --> 06:12:40,340
and they are going

22778
06:12:40,340 --> 06:12:41,540
in a fortnight.

22779
06:12:41,780 --> 06:12:42,980
Are they indeed?

22780
06:12:43,220 --> 06:12:44,060
Cried Elizabeth,

22781
06:12:44,060 --> 06:12:44,280
with the

22782
06:12:44,280 --> 06:12:45,560
greatest satisfaction.

22783
06:12:46,260 --> 06:12:46,760
They are going to

22784
06:12:46,760 --> 06:12:47,300
be encamped

22785
06:12:47,300 --> 06:12:48,180
near Brighton,

22786
06:12:48,180 --> 06:12:49,440
and I do so want

22787
06:12:49,440 --> 06:12:49,880
Papa to.

22788
06:12:49,880 --> 06:12:50,640
Take us all there

22789
06:12:50,640 --> 06:12:51,480
for the summer.

22790
06:12:51,480 --> 06:12:51,840
It would be

22791
06:12:51,840 --> 06:12:53,040
such a delicious scheme

22792
06:12:53,220 --> 06:12:53,940
and I daresay

22793
06:12:53,940 --> 06:12:54,360
it would cost.

22794
06:12:54,360 --> 06:12:54,980
Hardly anything.

22795
06:12:54,980 --> 06:12:55,680
At all.

22796
06:12:55,680 --> 06:12:57,060
Mama would like to go to

22797
06:12:57,060 --> 06:12:58,020
of all things.

22798
06:12:58,020 --> 06:12:58,620
Only think

22799
06:12:58,620 --> 06:12:59,900
what a miserable else

22800
06:12:59,900 --> 06:13:01,100
we shall have.

22801
06:13:01,440 --> 06:13:02,960
Yes, thought Elizabeth.

22802
06:13:03,380 --> 06:13:04,020
That would be

22803
06:13:04,020 --> 06:13:04,740
a delightful scheme

22804
06:13:04,740 --> 06:13:05,340
indeed.

22805
06:13:05,340 --> 06:13:06,060
And completely

22806
06:13:06,060 --> 06:13:07,260
do for us at once.

22807
06:13:07,520 --> 06:13:09,420
Good heaven, Brighton

22808
06:13:09,420 --> 06:13:10,500
and a co camp

22809
06:13:10,500 --> 06:13:11,780
full of soldiers to us

22810
06:13:12,020 --> 06:13:12,440
who have been

22811
06:13:12,440 --> 06:13:13,340
overstretched already

22812
06:13:13,340 --> 06:13:13,880
by one poor

22813
06:13:13,880 --> 06:13:15,000
regiment of militia

22814
06:13:15,000 --> 06:13:16,040
and the monthly bulls

22815
06:13:16,040 --> 06:13:17,240
of Meriton.

22816
06:13:17,660 --> 06:13:18,420
Now, I have got

22817
06:13:18,420 --> 06:13:19,620
some news for you.

22818
06:13:19,620 --> 06:13:20,300
Said Lydia,

22819
06:13:20,300 --> 06:13:20,820
as they sat

22820
06:13:20,820 --> 06:13:22,020
down at table.

22821
06:13:22,020 --> 06:13:23,000
What do you think?

22822
06:13:23,000 --> 06:13:24,480
It is excellent news,

22823
06:13:24,540 --> 06:13:25,640
capital news.

22824
06:13:25,640 --> 06:13:26,220
And about a.

22825
06:13:26,220 --> 06:13:27,380
Certain person

22826
06:13:27,380 --> 06:13:28,580
we all like.

22827
06:13:29,240 --> 06:13:30,200
Jane and Elizabeth

22828
06:13:30,200 --> 06:13:31,140
looked at each other

22829
06:13:31,140 --> 06:13:32,280
and the waiter was told

22830
06:13:32,280 --> 06:13:33,480
he need not stay.

22831
06:13:33,720 --> 06:13:34,580
Lydia laughed

22832
06:13:34,580 --> 06:13:35,900
and said hi.

22833
06:13:35,920 --> 06:13:36,740
That is just like

22834
06:13:36,740 --> 06:13:37,580
your formality

22835
06:13:37,580 --> 06:13:38,540
and discretion.

22836
06:13:38,540 --> 06:13:39,060
You thought the

22837
06:13:39,060 --> 06:13:40,260
waiter must not here

22838
06:13:40,280 --> 06:13:41,400
as if he cared.

22839
06:13:41,400 --> 06:13:42,020
I daresay

22840
06:13:42,020 --> 06:13:43,040
he often has worse

22841
06:13:43,040 --> 06:13:43,640
things said than

22842
06:13:43,640 --> 06:13:44,840
I am going to say.

22843
06:13:44,840 --> 06:13:45,380
But he is an

22844
06:13:45,380 --> 06:13:45,980
ugly fellow.

22845
06:13:45,980 --> 06:13:47,100
I am glad he's gone.

22846
06:13:47,100 --> 06:13:47,960
I never saw such

22847
06:13:47,960 --> 06:13:49,160
long chin in my life.

22848
06:13:49,620 --> 06:13:50,100
Well,

22849
06:13:50,100 --> 06:13:51,300
but now for my news.

22850
06:13:51,320 --> 06:13:52,520
It is about Dear

22851
06:13:52,520 --> 06:13:53,280
Wickham.

22852
06:13:53,280 --> 06:13:54,540
Too good for the waiter,

22853
06:13:54,540 --> 06:13:55,400
is it not?

22854
06:13:55,400 --> 06:13:56,420
There is no danger

22855
06:13:56,420 --> 06:13:56,900
of Wickens

22856
06:13:56,900 --> 06:13:58,100
marrying Mary King.

22857
06:13:58,280 --> 06:13:59,420
There is for you.

22858
06:13:59,420 --> 06:14:00,180
She is gone

22859
06:14:00,180 --> 06:14:00,900
down to her uncle

22860
06:14:00,900 --> 06:14:01,680
at Liverpool.

22861
06:14:01,680 --> 06:14:02,880
Gone to stay.

22862
06:14:02,900 --> 06:14:04,500
Wickham is safe

22863
06:14:05,180 --> 06:14:05,820
and Mary.

22864
06:14:05,820 --> 06:14:07,020
King is safe.

22865
06:14:07,040 --> 06:14:08,760
Added Elizabeth safe

22866
06:14:08,820 --> 06:14:09,540
from a connection.

22867
06:14:09,540 --> 06:14:11,060
Imprudent as to fortune.

22868
06:14:11,720 --> 06:14:12,660
She is grateful

22869
06:14:12,660 --> 06:14:13,340
for going away if.

22870
06:14:13,340 --> 06:14:13,820
She liked.

22871
06:14:13,820 --> 06:14:14,900
Him.

22872
06:14:14,900 --> 06:14:15,660
But I hope there's

22873
06:14:15,660 --> 06:14:16,620
no strong attachment

22874
06:14:16,620 --> 06:14:16,980
on either

22875
06:14:16,980 --> 06:14:18,440
side, said Jane.

22876
06:14:18,980 --> 06:14:19,500
I am sure

22877
06:14:19,500 --> 06:14:20,700
there is not on his.

22878
06:14:20,700 --> 06:14:21,680
I will answer for it.

22879
06:14:21,680 --> 06:14:21,940
You never

22880
06:14:21,940 --> 06:14:22,380
catch three

22881
06:14:22,380 --> 06:14:23,580
straws about her

22882
06:14:23,660 --> 06:14:24,780
who could about such

22883
06:14:24,780 --> 06:14:26,000
a nasty, freckled

22884
06:14:26,040 --> 06:14:27,240
little thing.

22885
06:14:27,420 --> 06:14:27,960
Elizabeth

22886
06:14:27,960 --> 06:14:29,160
was shocked to think

22887
06:14:29,220 --> 06:14:30,360
that, however incapable

22888
06:14:30,360 --> 06:14:31,140
of such coarseness

22889
06:14:31,140 --> 06:14:32,360
of expression herself,

22890
06:14:32,640 --> 06:14:33,200
the coarseness

22891
06:14:33,200 --> 06:14:34,020
of the sentiment

22892
06:14:34,020 --> 06:14:34,640
was little other

22893
06:14:34,640 --> 06:14:34,860
than her

22894
06:14:34,860 --> 06:14:35,580
own breasted

22895
06:14:35,580 --> 06:14:36,120
harbored and

22896
06:14:36,120 --> 06:14:37,320
fancy liberal.

22897
06:14:38,000 --> 06:14:39,240
As soon as all had eight

22898
06:14:39,240 --> 06:14:40,440
and the elder ones paid.

22899
06:14:40,640 --> 06:14:41,960
The carriage was ordered

22900
06:14:41,960 --> 06:14:42,500
and after

22901
06:14:42,500 --> 06:14:43,560
some contrivance

22902
06:14:43,560 --> 06:14:44,420
the whole party

22903
06:14:44,420 --> 06:14:44,940
with all their

22904
06:14:44,940 --> 06:14:45,800
boxes, work

22905
06:14:45,800 --> 06:14:47,000
bags and parcels

22906
06:14:47,000 --> 06:14:47,340
and the

22907
06:14:47,340 --> 06:14:48,140
unwelcome additions

22908
06:14:48,140 --> 06:14:48,540
of Kitty

22909
06:14:48,540 --> 06:14:49,740
and Lydia's purchases

22910
06:14:49,760 --> 06:14:50,960
were seated in it.

22911
06:14:51,180 --> 06:14:51,840
How nicely

22912
06:14:51,840 --> 06:14:52,620
we were all crammed.

22913
06:14:52,620 --> 06:14:53,820
In, cried Lydia.

22914
06:14:54,080 --> 06:14:54,980
I am glad I bought

22915
06:14:54,980 --> 06:14:55,740
my bonnet.

22916
06:14:55,740 --> 06:14:56,400
If it is only for.

22917
06:14:56,400 --> 06:14:56,700
The fun

22918
06:14:56,700 --> 06:14:57,000
of having

22919
06:14:57,000 --> 06:14:58,200
another band box.

22920
06:14:58,200 --> 06:14:58,940
Well, now

22921
06:14:58,940 --> 06:14:59,360
let us be

22922
06:14:59,360 --> 06:15:00,420
quite comfortable

22923
06:15:00,420 --> 06:15:01,020
and snug

22924
06:15:01,020 --> 06:15:02,000
and talk and laugh

22925
06:15:02,000 --> 06:15:03,200
all the way home.

22926
06:15:03,200 --> 06:15:04,160
And in the first place,

22927
06:15:04,160 --> 06:15:04,560
let us hear

22928
06:15:04,560 --> 06:15:05,220
what has happened to you

22929
06:15:05,220 --> 06:15:06,360
all since she went away.

22930
06:15:06,360 --> 06:15:06,800
Have you seen.

22931
06:15:06,800 --> 06:15:07,740
Any pleasant men?

22932
06:15:07,740 --> 06:15:08,120
Have you had

22933
06:15:08,120 --> 06:15:09,140
any flirting?

22934
06:15:09,140 --> 06:15:10,280
I was in great hopes

22935
06:15:10,280 --> 06:15:10,780
that one of you

22936
06:15:10,780 --> 06:15:11,520
have got a husband

22937
06:15:11,520 --> 06:15:12,680
before you came back.

22938
06:15:12,680 --> 06:15:13,400
Jane will be quite

22939
06:15:13,400 --> 06:15:14,460
an old maid soon,

22940
06:15:14,460 --> 06:15:15,140
I declare.

22941
06:15:15,140 --> 06:15:17,040
She's almost in 20.

22942
06:15:17,460 --> 06:15:18,420
Lord, how ashamed

22943
06:15:18,420 --> 06:15:18,860
I should be

22944
06:15:18,860 --> 06:15:19,680
of not being married

22945
06:15:19,680 --> 06:15:20,880
before three and 20

22946
06:15:21,020 --> 06:15:21,440
by Aunt

22947
06:15:21,440 --> 06:15:22,200
Philips wants you.

22948
06:15:22,200 --> 06:15:23,340
So to get husbands,

22949
06:15:23,340 --> 06:15:24,540
you can't think.

22950
06:15:24,620 --> 06:15:25,320
She says.

22951
06:15:25,320 --> 06:15:25,640
Lizzie,

22952
06:15:25,640 --> 06:15:26,600
it better have taken Mr.

22953
06:15:26,600 --> 06:15:27,140
Collins,

22954
06:15:27,140 --> 06:15:28,280
but I do not think

22955
06:15:28,280 --> 06:15:28,640
it would have been

22956
06:15:28,640 --> 06:15:29,780
any fun in it.

22957
06:15:29,780 --> 06:15:30,900
Lord, how

22958
06:15:30,900 --> 06:15:31,460
I should like

22959
06:15:31,460 --> 06:15:31,980
to be married

22960
06:15:31,980 --> 06:15:32,960
before any of you.

22961
06:15:32,960 --> 06:15:33,380
And then I

22962
06:15:33,380 --> 06:15:34,160
would chaperon

22963
06:15:34,160 --> 06:15:34,680
you about to

22964
06:15:34,680 --> 06:15:35,700
all the balls.

22965
06:15:35,700 --> 06:15:36,540
Dear me,

22966
06:15:36,540 --> 06:15:37,280
we had such a good.

22967
06:15:37,280 --> 06:15:37,700
Piece of fun

22968
06:15:37,700 --> 06:15:38,100
the other day.

22969
06:15:38,100 --> 06:15:38,460
It kind of.

22970
06:15:38,460 --> 06:15:40,020
Forced us, Kitty and me,

22971
06:15:40,120 --> 06:15:41,220
to spend the day there.

22972
06:15:41,220 --> 06:15:41,720
And Mrs.

22973
06:15:41,720 --> 06:15:42,440
Foster promised

22974
06:15:42,440 --> 06:15:43,260
to have a little dance

22975
06:15:43,260 --> 06:15:44,460
in the evening by the.

22976
06:15:44,460 --> 06:15:45,000
By Mrs.

22977
06:15:45,000 --> 06:15:45,560
Foster me

22978
06:15:45,560 --> 06:15:46,760
as such friends.

22979
06:15:46,880 --> 06:15:47,780
And so she asked the two

22980
06:15:47,780 --> 06:15:48,800
Harringtons to come.

22981
06:15:48,800 --> 06:15:49,880
But Harriet was ill,

22982
06:15:49,880 --> 06:15:50,940
and so Pen was forced

22983
06:15:50,940 --> 06:15:52,080
to come by herself.

22984
06:15:52,080 --> 06:15:52,580
And then what

22985
06:15:52,580 --> 06:15:53,780
do you think we did?

22986
06:15:53,820 --> 06:15:54,660
We dressed up

22987
06:15:54,660 --> 06:15:55,740
Shamblin and women's

22988
06:15:55,740 --> 06:15:56,760
clothes on purpose

22989
06:15:56,760 --> 06:15:58,100
to pass for a lady only.

22990
06:15:58,100 --> 06:15:59,300
Think What fun.

22991
06:15:59,400 --> 06:16:00,540
Not a soul knew of it,

22992
06:16:00,540 --> 06:16:01,040
but kind of.

22993
06:16:01,040 --> 06:16:01,340
Mrs.

22994
06:16:01,340 --> 06:16:02,600
Foster and Kitty had me,

22995
06:16:02,880 --> 06:16:03,740
except my aunt.

22996
06:16:03,740 --> 06:16:04,500
We were forced to borrow

22997
06:16:04,500 --> 06:16:05,400
one of her gowns.

22998
06:16:05,400 --> 06:16:06,120
And you cannot

22999
06:16:06,120 --> 06:16:06,900
imagine how

23000
06:16:06,900 --> 06:16:08,100
well he looked

23001
06:16:08,240 --> 06:16:09,420
when Danny and Wickham

23002
06:16:09,420 --> 06:16:09,980
and Pratt

23003
06:16:09,980 --> 06:16:10,740
and two or three

23004
06:16:10,740 --> 06:16:11,760
more of the men came in.

23005
06:16:11,760 --> 06:16:12,720
They did not know him

23006
06:16:12,720 --> 06:16:13,560
in the least.

23007
06:16:13,560 --> 06:16:15,680
Lord, how I laughed.

23008
06:16:15,680 --> 06:16:16,500
And so did Mrs.

23009
06:16:16,500 --> 06:16:17,180
Foster.

23010
06:16:17,180 --> 06:16:17,640
I thought

23011
06:16:17,640 --> 06:16:18,840
I should have died.

23012
06:16:18,840 --> 06:16:19,740
And that made

23013
06:16:19,740 --> 06:16:19,980
the men

23014
06:16:19,980 --> 06:16:21,000
suspect something.

23015
06:16:21,000 --> 06:16:21,660
And then they soon

23016
06:16:21,660 --> 06:16:22,140
found out what

23017
06:16:22,140 --> 06:16:22,820
was the matter

23018
06:16:23,780 --> 06:16:23,960
with.

23019
06:16:23,960 --> 06:16:25,260
Such kind of histories

23020
06:16:25,260 --> 06:16:26,060
and their parties

23021
06:16:26,060 --> 06:16:27,140
and good jokes.

23022
06:16:27,140 --> 06:16:28,380
Did Lydia, assisted

23023
06:16:28,380 --> 06:16:29,340
by Kitty's hints

23024
06:16:29,340 --> 06:16:30,240
and additions,

23025
06:16:30,240 --> 06:16:30,660
endeavored

23026
06:16:30,660 --> 06:16:31,800
to amuse her companions

23027
06:16:31,800 --> 06:16:32,540
all the way too long

23028
06:16:32,540 --> 06:16:33,200
born.

23029
06:16:33,200 --> 06:16:34,200
Elizabeth listened

23030
06:16:34,200 --> 06:16:35,360
as little as she could,

23031
06:16:35,360 --> 06:16:35,780
but there was

23032
06:16:35,780 --> 06:16:36,440
no escaping

23033
06:16:36,440 --> 06:16:37,400
the frequent mention

23034
06:16:37,400 --> 06:16:38,600
of Wickham's name.

23035
06:16:39,240 --> 06:16:39,920
They reception

23036
06:16:39,920 --> 06:16:41,180
at home was most kind.

23037
06:16:41,460 --> 06:16:41,820
Mrs.

23038
06:16:41,820 --> 06:16:42,480
Bennett rejoiced

23039
06:16:42,480 --> 06:16:43,100
to see Jane

23040
06:16:43,100 --> 06:16:44,300
in undiminished beauty.

23041
06:16:44,540 --> 06:16:44,780
And.

23042
06:16:44,780 --> 06:16:45,480
More than once

23043
06:16:45,480 --> 06:16:46,460
during dinner, did Mr.

23044
06:16:46,460 --> 06:16:47,700
Bennett say voluntarily

23045
06:16:47,700 --> 06:16:48,900
to Elizabeth.

23046
06:16:48,960 --> 06:16:49,980
I am glad you are.

23047
06:16:49,980 --> 06:16:51,180
Come back, Lizzy.

23048
06:16:51,840 --> 06:16:52,400
Their party

23049
06:16:52,400 --> 06:16:53,040
in the dining room

23050
06:16:53,040 --> 06:16:53,600
was large

23051
06:16:53,600 --> 06:16:54,260
for almost all.

23052
06:16:54,260 --> 06:16:55,020
Lucas's came

23053
06:16:55,020 --> 06:16:55,800
to meet Mariah

23054
06:16:55,800 --> 06:16:56,880
and hear the news,

23055
06:16:56,880 --> 06:16:57,560
and various were

23056
06:16:57,560 --> 06:16:58,220
the subjects

23057
06:16:58,220 --> 06:16:59,420
that occupied them.

23058
06:16:59,640 --> 06:17:00,380
Lady Lucas

23059
06:17:00,380 --> 06:17:01,580
was inquiring of Mariah

23060
06:17:01,580 --> 06:17:02,360
after the welfare

23061
06:17:02,360 --> 06:17:03,000
and poultry

23062
06:17:03,000 --> 06:17:04,200
of her eldest daughter.

23063
06:17:04,500 --> 06:17:04,820
Mrs.

23064
06:17:04,820 --> 06:17:05,160
Bennett

23065
06:17:05,160 --> 06:17:06,360
was doubly engaged

23066
06:17:06,360 --> 06:17:07,160
on the one hand,

23067
06:17:07,160 --> 06:17:08,000
collecting an account

23068
06:17:08,000 --> 06:17:08,480
of the present

23069
06:17:08,480 --> 06:17:09,680
fashions from Jane,

23070
06:17:09,740 --> 06:17:10,580
who sat some way

23071
06:17:10,580 --> 06:17:11,300
below her

23072
06:17:11,300 --> 06:17:12,060
and on the other,

23073
06:17:12,060 --> 06:17:12,720
retailing them

23074
06:17:12,720 --> 06:17:13,380
all to the younger

23075
06:17:13,380 --> 06:17:15,000
Lucas's and Lydia,

23076
06:17:15,000 --> 06:17:16,200
in a voice rather louder

23077
06:17:16,200 --> 06:17:16,700
than any other

23078
06:17:16,700 --> 06:17:18,240
persons, was enumerating

23079
06:17:18,240 --> 06:17:19,200
the various pleasures

23080
06:17:19,200 --> 06:17:19,700
of the morning

23081
06:17:19,700 --> 06:17:20,340
to anybody

23082
06:17:20,340 --> 06:17:21,540
who would hear her.

23083
06:17:21,680 --> 06:17:23,300
Oh, Mary, said she.

23084
06:17:23,520 --> 06:17:23,960
I wish.

23085
06:17:23,960 --> 06:17:24,780
She had gone with us.

23086
06:17:24,780 --> 06:17:25,980
We had such fun

23087
06:17:26,160 --> 06:17:26,960
as we went along

23088
06:17:26,960 --> 06:17:27,600
kitty night

23089
06:17:27,600 --> 06:17:28,700
you up the blinds and.

23090
06:17:28,700 --> 06:17:29,180
Pretended

23091
06:17:29,180 --> 06:17:29,760
there was nobody.

23092
06:17:29,760 --> 06:17:30,420
In the couch.

23093
06:17:30,420 --> 06:17:31,280
And I should have gone

23094
06:17:31,280 --> 06:17:31,920
to all the way

23095
06:17:31,920 --> 06:17:32,360
if Kitty

23096
06:17:32,360 --> 06:17:33,560
had not been sick.

23097
06:17:33,560 --> 06:17:34,020
And When we got

23098
06:17:34,020 --> 06:17:34,640
to the George,

23099
06:17:34,640 --> 06:17:35,460
I do think we behaved

23100
06:17:35,460 --> 06:17:36,380
very handsomely.

23101
06:17:36,380 --> 06:17:36,980
If we treated

23102
06:17:36,980 --> 06:17:37,500
the other three

23103
06:17:37,500 --> 06:17:38,480
with the nicest cold

23104
06:17:38,480 --> 06:17:39,600
luncheon in the world.

23105
06:17:39,600 --> 06:17:40,200
And if you would

23106
06:17:40,200 --> 06:17:40,560
have gone,

23107
06:17:40,560 --> 06:17:40,820
we would have

23108
06:17:40,820 --> 06:17:41,940
treated you too.

23109
06:17:41,940 --> 06:17:42,980
And then we came away

23110
06:17:42,980 --> 06:17:44,180
with such.

23111
06:17:44,240 --> 06:17:45,080
I thought we never

23112
06:17:45,080 --> 06:17:45,480
should have got

23113
06:17:45,480 --> 06:17:45,980
into the couch.

23114
06:17:45,980 --> 06:17:47,220
I was ready to die

23115
06:17:47,220 --> 06:17:48,420
of laughter.

23116
06:17:48,480 --> 06:17:49,040
And then we were.

23117
06:17:49,040 --> 06:17:49,680
So merry

23118
06:17:49,680 --> 06:17:50,600
all the way home.

23119
06:17:50,600 --> 06:17:51,300
We talked

23120
06:17:51,300 --> 06:17:52,440
and laughed so loud

23121
06:17:52,440 --> 06:17:53,100
that anybody

23122
06:17:53,100 --> 06:17:53,640
might have heard it

23123
06:17:53,640 --> 06:17:54,840
ten miles off

23124
06:17:55,400 --> 06:17:56,220
to this.

23125
06:17:56,220 --> 06:17:57,300
Mary very gravely

23126
06:17:57,300 --> 06:17:58,500
replied.

23127
06:17:58,520 --> 06:17:59,220
Far be it

23128
06:17:59,220 --> 06:18:00,420
from me, my dear sister,

23129
06:18:00,600 --> 06:18:01,380
To depreciate

23130
06:18:01,380 --> 06:18:02,460
such pleasures,

23131
06:18:02,460 --> 06:18:03,860
they would be congenial

23132
06:18:03,860 --> 06:18:04,040
with the.

23133
06:18:04,040 --> 06:18:04,760
Generality of

23134
06:18:04,760 --> 06:18:05,900
female minds.

23135
06:18:05,900 --> 06:18:06,660
But I confess

23136
06:18:06,660 --> 06:18:06,900
they would

23137
06:18:06,900 --> 06:18:07,560
have no charms.

23138
06:18:07,560 --> 06:18:08,280
For me,

23139
06:18:08,280 --> 06:18:09,240
I should infinitely.

23140
06:18:09,240 --> 06:18:10,140
Prefer. A book.

23141
06:18:11,120 --> 06:18:12,020
But at his answer,

23142
06:18:12,020 --> 06:18:13,220
Lydia heard not a word.

23143
06:18:13,400 --> 06:18:13,940
She seldom

23144
06:18:13,940 --> 06:18:14,760
listened to anybody

23145
06:18:14,760 --> 06:18:15,200
for more than

23146
06:18:15,200 --> 06:18:15,960
half a minute

23147
06:18:15,960 --> 06:18:16,920
and never attended

23148
06:18:16,920 --> 06:18:18,120
to Mary at all.

23149
06:18:18,800 --> 06:18:19,620
In the afternoon.

23150
06:18:19,620 --> 06:18:20,360
Lydia was urgent,

23151
06:18:20,360 --> 06:18:20,820
but the rest

23152
06:18:20,820 --> 06:18:21,300
of the girls

23153
06:18:21,300 --> 06:18:22,380
to walk to Maritain

23154
06:18:22,380 --> 06:18:22,820
and to see

23155
06:18:22,820 --> 06:18:24,020
how everybody went on.

23156
06:18:24,080 --> 06:18:25,220
But Elizabeth steadily

23157
06:18:25,220 --> 06:18:26,420
opposed the scheme.

23158
06:18:26,480 --> 06:18:27,080
It should not.

23159
06:18:27,080 --> 06:18:27,620
Be said that

23160
06:18:27,620 --> 06:18:28,220
the Miss Bennetts

23161
06:18:28,220 --> 06:18:29,100
could not be at home

23162
06:18:29,100 --> 06:18:29,720
half a day

23163
06:18:29,720 --> 06:18:30,200
before they were

23164
06:18:30,200 --> 06:18:30,660
in pursuit

23165
06:18:30,660 --> 06:18:31,860
of the officers.

23166
06:18:31,880 --> 06:18:32,180
There was

23167
06:18:32,180 --> 06:18:33,020
another reason, too,

23168
06:18:33,020 --> 06:18:34,140
for her opposition.

23169
06:18:34,140 --> 06:18:35,360
She dreaded seeing Mr.

23170
06:18:35,360 --> 06:18:36,140
Wickham again

23171
06:18:36,140 --> 06:18:37,040
and was resolved

23172
06:18:37,040 --> 06:18:37,640
to avoid it

23173
06:18:37,640 --> 06:18:38,840
as long as possible.

23174
06:18:39,000 --> 06:18:40,040
The comfort to her

23175
06:18:40,040 --> 06:18:40,640
of the regiment's

23176
06:18:40,640 --> 06:18:41,060
approaching

23177
06:18:41,060 --> 06:18:42,000
removal was indeed

23178
06:18:42,000 --> 06:18:43,200
beyond expression.

23179
06:18:43,520 --> 06:18:44,340
In a fortnight

23180
06:18:44,340 --> 06:18:45,380
they were to go,

23181
06:18:45,380 --> 06:18:46,520
and once gone

23182
06:18:46,520 --> 06:18:47,100
she hoped

23183
06:18:47,100 --> 06:18:47,420
there could be

23184
06:18:47,420 --> 06:18:48,020
nothing more to

23185
06:18:48,020 --> 06:18:48,620
plague her.

23186
06:18:48,620 --> 06:18:49,400
On his account.

23187
06:18:50,460 --> 06:18:51,120
She had not been.

23188
06:18:51,120 --> 06:18:51,620
Many hours

23189
06:18:51,620 --> 06:18:52,200
at home before.

23190
06:18:52,200 --> 06:18:52,740
She found that

23191
06:18:52,740 --> 06:18:53,720
the Brighton scheme,

23192
06:18:53,720 --> 06:18:54,420
of which Lydia

23193
06:18:54,420 --> 06:18:55,220
had given them a hint at

23194
06:18:55,220 --> 06:18:55,880
the end,

23195
06:18:55,880 --> 06:18:56,780
was under frequent

23196
06:18:56,780 --> 06:18:57,300
discussion

23197
06:18:57,300 --> 06:18:58,500
between her parents.

23198
06:18:58,620 --> 06:18:59,900
Elizabeth saw directly

23199
06:18:59,900 --> 06:19:00,500
that her father

23200
06:19:00,500 --> 06:19:01,400
had not the smallest.

23201
06:19:01,400 --> 06:19:02,600
Intention of yielding.

23202
06:19:02,880 --> 06:19:03,720
But his answers

23203
06:19:03,720 --> 06:19:04,560
were at the same time

23204
06:19:04,560 --> 06:19:05,840
so vague and equivocal

23205
06:19:06,080 --> 06:19:07,100
that her mother, though

23206
06:19:07,100 --> 06:19:08,300
often disheartened,

23207
06:19:08,340 --> 06:19:09,500
had never yet despaired

23208
06:19:09,500 --> 06:19:10,260
of succeeding.

23209
06:19:10,260 --> 06:19:11,460
At last.

23210
06:19:12,620 --> 06:19:13,820
Chapter 40.

23211
06:19:14,780 --> 06:19:15,380
Elizabeth's

23212
06:19:15,380 --> 06:19:16,020
impatience

23213
06:19:16,020 --> 06:19:16,860
to acquaint Jane

23214
06:19:16,860 --> 06:19:17,700
with what had happened

23215
06:19:17,700 --> 06:19:18,380
could no longer

23216
06:19:18,380 --> 06:19:19,500
be overcome

23217
06:19:19,500 --> 06:19:20,820
and at length resolving

23218
06:19:20,820 --> 06:19:21,420
to suppress

23219
06:19:21,420 --> 06:19:22,200
every particular

23220
06:19:22,200 --> 06:19:22,520
in which

23221
06:19:22,520 --> 06:19:23,720
her sister was concerned

23222
06:19:23,940 --> 06:19:24,660
and preparing her

23223
06:19:24,660 --> 06:19:25,760
to be surprised

23224
06:19:25,760 --> 06:19:26,660
she related to her.

23225
06:19:26,660 --> 06:19:27,420
The next morning,

23226
06:19:27,420 --> 06:19:28,340
the chief of the scene

23227
06:19:28,340 --> 06:19:28,880
between Mr.

23228
06:19:28,880 --> 06:19:30,080
Darcy and herself.

23229
06:19:30,720 --> 06:19:30,980
Miss.

23230
06:19:30,980 --> 06:19:31,980
Bennett's astonishment,

23231
06:19:31,980 --> 06:19:32,760
was seen lessened

23232
06:19:32,760 --> 06:19:33,360
by the strong

23233
06:19:33,360 --> 06:19:34,680
sisterly partiality

23234
06:19:34,880 --> 06:19:35,340
which made

23235
06:19:35,340 --> 06:19:36,180
any admiration

23236
06:19:36,180 --> 06:19:37,040
of Elizabeth appear

23237
06:19:37,040 --> 06:19:38,240
perfectly natural,

23238
06:19:38,340 --> 06:19:39,360
and all surprise

23239
06:19:39,360 --> 06:19:40,400
was shortly lost

23240
06:19:40,400 --> 06:19:41,600
other feelings.

23241
06:19:41,640 --> 06:19:42,740
She was sorry that Mr.

23242
06:19:42,740 --> 06:19:43,340
Darcy should have

23243
06:19:43,340 --> 06:19:44,300
delivered his sentiments

23244
06:19:44,300 --> 06:19:44,760
in a manner

23245
06:19:44,760 --> 06:19:45,500
so little suited

23246
06:19:45,500 --> 06:19:46,680
to recommend them.

23247
06:19:46,680 --> 06:19:47,480
But still more.

23248
06:19:47,480 --> 06:19:47,760
Was she

23249
06:19:47,760 --> 06:19:48,260
grieved for

23250
06:19:48,260 --> 06:19:49,040
the unhappiness

23251
06:19:49,040 --> 06:19:49,700
which her sister's

23252
06:19:49,700 --> 06:19:50,400
refusal must

23253
06:19:50,400 --> 06:19:51,060
have given him?

23254
06:19:52,100 --> 06:19:52,980
His being so sure

23255
06:19:52,980 --> 06:19:54,180
of succeeding was wrong,

23256
06:19:54,440 --> 06:19:55,380
said she,

23257
06:19:55,380 --> 06:19:56,300
and certainly ought

23258
06:19:56,300 --> 06:19:57,500
not to have appeared.

23259
06:19:57,500 --> 06:19:58,520
But consider how much

23260
06:19:58,520 --> 06:19:59,340
it must increase

23261
06:19:59,340 --> 06:20:00,540
his disappointment.

23262
06:20:01,160 --> 06:20:02,100
Indeed,

23263
06:20:02,100 --> 06:20:03,300
replied Elizabeth.

23264
06:20:03,380 --> 06:20:04,160
I am heartily

23265
06:20:04,160 --> 06:20:05,660
sorry for him, but he.

23266
06:20:05,660 --> 06:20:06,480
Has other feelings

23267
06:20:06,480 --> 06:20:06,720
which will.

23268
06:20:06,720 --> 06:20:07,920
Probably soon drive away

23269
06:20:07,920 --> 06:20:09,120
his regard for me.

23270
06:20:09,660 --> 06:20:10,620
You do not blame me,

23271
06:20:10,620 --> 06:20:10,920
however,

23272
06:20:10,920 --> 06:20:12,120
for refusing him

23273
06:20:12,440 --> 06:20:13,500
blame you?

23274
06:20:13,500 --> 06:20:14,700
Oh, no.

23275
06:20:15,120 --> 06:20:16,040
But you blame me

23276
06:20:16,040 --> 06:20:16,820
for having spoken

23277
06:20:16,820 --> 06:20:18,020
so warmly of Wickham?

23278
06:20:18,860 --> 06:20:20,520
No, I not know

23279
06:20:20,520 --> 06:20:21,120
that you were wrong

23280
06:20:21,120 --> 06:20:22,320
in saying what you did.

23281
06:20:22,940 --> 06:20:24,020
But he will know it

23282
06:20:24,020 --> 06:20:24,600
when I tell you

23283
06:20:24,600 --> 06:20:25,160
what happened

23284
06:20:25,160 --> 06:20:26,360
the very next day.

23285
06:20:27,380 --> 06:20:28,080
She then spoke

23286
06:20:28,080 --> 06:20:28,860
of the letter,

23287
06:20:28,860 --> 06:20:29,700
repeating the whole

23288
06:20:29,700 --> 06:20:30,380
its contents

23289
06:20:30,380 --> 06:20:30,840
as far as

23290
06:20:30,840 --> 06:20:31,440
they concerned.

23291
06:20:31,440 --> 06:20:32,640
George Wickham.

23292
06:20:32,660 --> 06:20:33,440
What a stroke.

23293
06:20:33,440 --> 06:20:34,100
Was this for?

23294
06:20:34,100 --> 06:20:35,220
Poor Jane.

23295
06:20:35,220 --> 06:20:36,020
Who would willingly

23296
06:20:36,020 --> 06:20:36,420
have gone

23297
06:20:36,420 --> 06:20:36,960
through the world

23298
06:20:36,960 --> 06:20:37,620
without believing

23299
06:20:37,620 --> 06:20:38,780
that so much wickedness

23300
06:20:38,780 --> 06:20:39,380
existed in?

23301
06:20:39,380 --> 06:20:39,720
The whole

23302
06:20:39,720 --> 06:20:40,920
race of mankind,

23303
06:20:40,940 --> 06:20:41,300
as it was

23304
06:20:41,300 --> 06:20:42,080
here, collected

23305
06:20:42,080 --> 06:20:43,280
in one individual.

23306
06:20:43,700 --> 06:20:44,760
Nor was Darcy's

23307
06:20:44,760 --> 06:20:45,860
vindication, though

23308
06:20:45,860 --> 06:20:47,060
grateful to her feelings

23309
06:20:47,300 --> 06:20:48,600
capable of consoling her

23310
06:20:48,600 --> 06:20:49,800
for such discovery.

23311
06:20:50,120 --> 06:20:51,060
Most earnestly,

23312
06:20:51,060 --> 06:20:51,680
did she labor

23313
06:20:51,680 --> 06:20:52,080
to prove

23314
06:20:52,080 --> 06:20:53,280
the probability of error

23315
06:20:53,460 --> 06:20:54,320
and seek to clear

23316
06:20:54,320 --> 06:20:54,740
the one

23317
06:20:54,740 --> 06:20:55,520
without involving

23318
06:20:55,520 --> 06:20:56,720
the other.

23319
06:20:57,000 --> 06:20:58,320
This will not do,

23320
06:20:58,560 --> 06:20:59,660
said Elizabeth.

23321
06:20:59,660 --> 06:21:00,500
You will never be able

23322
06:21:00,500 --> 06:21:01,260
to make both of them

23323
06:21:01,260 --> 06:21:02,460
good for anything.

23324
06:21:02,540 --> 06:21:03,500
Take your choice.

23325
06:21:03,500 --> 06:21:04,280
But she must be

23326
06:21:04,280 --> 06:21:05,760
satisfied with only one.

23327
06:21:06,060 --> 06:21:06,440
There is

23328
06:21:06,440 --> 06:21:07,500
but such a quantity

23329
06:21:07,500 --> 06:21:08,580
of merit between them.

23330
06:21:08,580 --> 06:21:09,860
Just enough to make one

23331
06:21:09,860 --> 06:21:11,060
good sort of man.

23332
06:21:11,220 --> 06:21:11,940
And of late,

23333
06:21:11,940 --> 06:21:12,740
it has been shifting

23334
06:21:12,740 --> 06:21:13,940
about pretty much

23335
06:21:14,280 --> 06:21:14,940
my part.

23336
06:21:14,940 --> 06:21:15,620
I am inclined

23337
06:21:15,620 --> 06:21:16,320
to believe it all.

23338
06:21:16,320 --> 06:21:17,340
Darcy's.

23339
06:21:17,340 --> 06:21:18,200
But you shall do

23340
06:21:18,200 --> 06:21:19,400
you choose.

23341
06:21:19,580 --> 06:21:20,480
It was some time,

23342
06:21:20,480 --> 06:21:21,600
however, before a smile

23343
06:21:21,600 --> 06:21:22,340
could be extorted

23344
06:21:22,340 --> 06:21:23,540
from Jane.

23345
06:21:23,760 --> 06:21:24,680
I do not know.

23346
06:21:24,680 --> 06:21:25,380
And I've been more

23347
06:21:25,380 --> 06:21:26,820
shocked, said she.

23348
06:21:27,360 --> 06:21:28,980
We can very bad.

23349
06:21:29,300 --> 06:21:30,360
It is almost past

23350
06:21:30,360 --> 06:21:31,520
belief.

23351
06:21:31,520 --> 06:21:32,400
And poor Mr.

23352
06:21:32,400 --> 06:21:33,600
Darcy.

23353
06:21:33,780 --> 06:21:34,920
Dear Lizzie only.

23354
06:21:34,920 --> 06:21:35,660
Consider what

23355
06:21:35,660 --> 06:21:36,860
he must have suffered

23356
06:21:37,020 --> 06:21:38,220
such a disappointment.

23357
06:21:38,600 --> 06:21:39,440
And with the knowledge

23358
06:21:39,440 --> 06:21:40,880
of your ill opinion too.

23359
06:21:41,100 --> 06:21:41,660
And having to

23360
06:21:41,660 --> 06:21:42,200
relate such

23361
06:21:42,200 --> 06:21:43,400
a thing of his sister.

23362
06:21:43,940 --> 06:21:44,520
It is really

23363
06:21:44,520 --> 06:21:45,720
too distressing.

23364
06:21:46,040 --> 06:21:46,980
I am sure you must

23365
06:21:46,980 --> 06:21:48,800
feel it so how?

23366
06:21:48,800 --> 06:21:49,220
No.

23367
06:21:49,220 --> 06:21:49,700
My regret

23368
06:21:49,700 --> 06:21:50,280
and compassion

23369
06:21:50,280 --> 06:21:50,960
are all done away

23370
06:21:50,960 --> 06:21:51,740
by seeing you

23371
06:21:51,740 --> 06:21:52,940
so full of both.

23372
06:21:53,040 --> 06:21:54,080
I know you will do him

23373
06:21:54,080 --> 06:21:55,320
such ample justice

23374
06:21:55,320 --> 06:21:55,860
that I am going

23375
06:21:55,860 --> 06:21:56,540
every moment

23376
06:21:56,540 --> 06:21:57,620
more unconcerned,

23377
06:21:57,620 --> 06:21:58,760
indifferent.

23378
06:21:58,760 --> 06:21:59,580
Your profusion

23379
06:21:59,580 --> 06:22:00,780
makes me saving.

23380
06:22:00,800 --> 06:22:01,300
And if you lay.

23381
06:22:01,300 --> 06:22:02,640
Bent to him much longer,

23382
06:22:02,900 --> 06:22:03,720
my heart will be

23383
06:22:03,720 --> 06:22:04,920
as light as a feather.

23384
06:22:05,840 --> 06:22:07,040
Poor Wickham.

23385
06:22:07,080 --> 06:22:08,220
There is an expression

23386
06:22:08,220 --> 06:22:08,840
of goodness

23387
06:22:08,840 --> 06:22:09,980
in his countenance.

23388
06:22:09,980 --> 06:22:11,000
Such an openness

23389
06:22:11,000 --> 06:22:11,720
and gentleness

23390
06:22:11,720 --> 06:22:12,920
in his manner.

23391
06:22:13,400 --> 06:22:13,580
There

23392
06:22:13,580 --> 06:22:14,340
certainly was

23393
06:22:14,340 --> 06:22:14,840
some great.

23394
06:22:14,840 --> 06:22:15,600
Mismanagement

23395
06:22:15,600 --> 06:22:16,280
in the education

23396
06:22:16,280 --> 06:22:17,480
of those two young.

23397
06:22:17,640 --> 06:22:18,240
One has got

23398
06:22:18,240 --> 06:22:18,960
all the goodness

23399
06:22:18,960 --> 06:22:19,560
and the other will

23400
06:22:19,560 --> 06:22:20,760
the appearance of it.

23401
06:22:21,480 --> 06:22:22,320
I never thought Mr.

23402
06:22:22,320 --> 06:22:22,640
Darcy

23403
06:22:22,640 --> 06:22:23,220
so deficient

23404
06:22:23,220 --> 06:22:24,180
in the appearance of it

23405
06:22:24,180 --> 06:22:25,380
as you used to do.

23406
06:22:25,760 --> 06:22:26,420
And yet

23407
06:22:26,420 --> 06:22:27,060
I to be

23408
06:22:27,060 --> 06:22:28,100
uncommonly clever

23409
06:22:28,100 --> 06:22:28,740
in taking so.

23410
06:22:28,740 --> 06:22:30,120
Decided dislike to him

23411
06:22:30,120 --> 06:22:30,560
without any.

23412
06:22:30,560 --> 06:22:31,620
Reason.

23413
06:22:31,620 --> 06:22:32,880
It is such a spur

23414
06:22:32,880 --> 06:22:34,080
to one's genius,

23415
06:22:34,220 --> 06:22:35,720
such an opening for wit

23416
06:22:35,960 --> 06:22:36,240
to have.

23417
06:22:36,240 --> 06:22:37,020
A dislike of that.

23418
06:22:37,020 --> 06:22:37,940
Kind.

23419
06:22:37,940 --> 06:22:38,600
One may be.

23420
06:22:38,600 --> 06:22:39,780
Continually abusive.

23421
06:22:39,780 --> 06:22:40,340
Without saying.

23422
06:22:40,340 --> 06:22:41,520
Anything just

23423
06:22:41,520 --> 06:22:42,540
but one cannot be.

23424
06:22:42,540 --> 06:22:43,880
Always laughing at a man

23425
06:22:43,880 --> 06:22:44,760
without now and then.

23426
06:22:44,760 --> 06:22:45,440
Stumbling on

23427
06:22:45,440 --> 06:22:46,640
something witty.

23428
06:22:47,280 --> 06:22:48,200
Lizzie,

23429
06:22:48,200 --> 06:22:49,100
when you first read

23430
06:22:49,100 --> 06:22:49,680
that letter,

23431
06:22:49,680 --> 06:22:50,300
I am sure you could

23432
06:22:50,300 --> 06:22:50,840
not treat.

23433
06:22:50,840 --> 06:22:51,720
The matter as you do.

23434
06:22:51,720 --> 06:22:52,920
Now.

23435
06:22:52,980 --> 06:22:53,880
Indeed,

23436
06:22:53,880 --> 06:22:55,080
I could not.

23437
06:22:55,160 --> 06:22:56,120
I was uncomfortable

23438
06:22:56,120 --> 06:22:56,840
enough.

23439
06:22:56,840 --> 06:22:58,280
I may say unhappy

23440
06:22:58,820 --> 06:22:59,520
and with no one

23441
06:22:59,520 --> 06:23:00,180
to speak to

23442
06:23:00,180 --> 06:23:01,380
about what I felt.

23443
06:23:01,620 --> 06:23:02,300
No, Jane.

23444
06:23:02,300 --> 06:23:03,080
To comfort me

23445
06:23:03,080 --> 06:23:03,380
and say

23446
06:23:03,380 --> 06:23:04,200
that I had not been

23447
06:23:04,200 --> 06:23:05,460
so very weak and vain

23448
06:23:05,460 --> 06:23:06,200
and nonsensical

23449
06:23:06,200 --> 06:23:07,400
as I knew I had.

23450
06:23:07,920 --> 06:23:10,140
Oh, how I wanted you.

23451
06:23:11,100 --> 06:23:12,360
How unfortunate that you

23452
06:23:12,360 --> 06:23:13,020
should have used her

23453
06:23:13,020 --> 06:23:14,120
very strong expressions

23454
06:23:14,120 --> 06:23:15,000
in speaking of Wickham

23455
06:23:15,000 --> 06:23:16,200
to Mr. Darcy.

23456
06:23:16,220 --> 06:23:17,300
But now they do appear

23457
06:23:17,300 --> 06:23:18,720
so wholly undeserved.

23458
06:23:19,440 --> 06:23:20,640
Certainly.

23459
06:23:20,700 --> 06:23:21,800
But the misfortune of.

23460
06:23:21,800 --> 06:23:22,260
Speaking.

23461
06:23:22,260 --> 06:23:22,940
With bitterness

23462
06:23:22,940 --> 06:23:23,340
is the most

23463
06:23:23,340 --> 06:23:24,480
natural consequence

23464
06:23:24,480 --> 06:23:24,660
of the.

23465
06:23:24,660 --> 06:23:25,740
Prejudices I had.

23466
06:23:25,740 --> 06:23:26,940
Encouraging.

23467
06:23:27,020 --> 06:23:27,980
There's one point on

23468
06:23:27,980 --> 06:23:28,560
which I want

23469
06:23:28,560 --> 06:23:29,720
your advice.

23470
06:23:29,720 --> 06:23:30,660
I want to be told

23471
06:23:30,660 --> 06:23:31,680
whether I ought

23472
06:23:31,680 --> 06:23:33,180
or ought not to make

23473
06:23:33,180 --> 06:23:33,840
our acquaintance

23474
06:23:33,840 --> 06:23:34,380
in general.

23475
06:23:34,380 --> 06:23:35,580
Understand Wickham's.

23476
06:23:36,980 --> 06:23:37,620
Miss Bennet

23477
06:23:37,620 --> 06:23:38,300
paused a little

23478
06:23:38,300 --> 06:23:39,500
and then replied.

23479
06:23:39,920 --> 06:23:40,440
Surely

23480
06:23:40,440 --> 06:23:41,360
there can be no occasion

23481
06:23:41,360 --> 06:23:42,180
for exposing him

23482
06:23:42,180 --> 06:23:43,380
so dreadfully.

23483
06:23:43,580 --> 06:23:44,780
What is your opinion

23484
06:23:45,620 --> 06:23:46,260
that it ought

23485
06:23:46,260 --> 06:23:47,460
not to be attempted?

23486
06:23:47,880 --> 06:23:48,200
Mr.

23487
06:23:48,200 --> 06:23:48,980
Darcy has not

23488
06:23:48,980 --> 06:23:49,680
authorized me

23489
06:23:49,680 --> 06:23:50,040
to make his.

23490
06:23:50,040 --> 06:23:50,640
Communication.

23491
06:23:50,640 --> 06:23:51,540
Public.

23492
06:23:51,540 --> 06:23:52,460
On the contrary,

23493
06:23:52,460 --> 06:23:53,340
every particular.

23494
06:23:53,340 --> 06:23:53,840
Relative to

23495
06:23:53,840 --> 06:23:54,480
his sister

23496
06:23:54,480 --> 06:23:55,260
was meant be kept.

23497
06:23:55,260 --> 06:23:55,680
As much as

23498
06:23:55,680 --> 06:23:56,880
possible to myself.

23499
06:23:57,360 --> 06:23:58,220
And if I endeavor

23500
06:23:58,220 --> 06:23:58,880
to, one deceive.

23501
06:23:58,880 --> 06:23:59,180
People

23502
06:23:59,180 --> 06:23:59,900
as to the rest of.

23503
06:23:59,900 --> 06:24:00,920
His conduct,

23504
06:24:00,920 --> 06:24:02,120
who will believe me?

23505
06:24:02,240 --> 06:24:02,820
The general.

23506
06:24:02,820 --> 06:24:03,920
Prejudice against Mr..

23507
06:24:03,920 --> 06:24:04,340
Darcy.

23508
06:24:04,340 --> 06:24:05,360
So violent

23509
06:24:05,360 --> 06:24:05,780
that it would be

23510
06:24:05,780 --> 06:24:06,540
the death of half

23511
06:24:06,540 --> 06:24:07,080
the good people

23512
06:24:07,080 --> 06:24:07,620
in Meriden

23513
06:24:07,620 --> 06:24:07,980
to attempt

23514
06:24:07,980 --> 06:24:08,480
to place him

23515
06:24:08,480 --> 06:24:09,680
in an amiable light.

23516
06:24:10,280 --> 06:24:11,600
I am not equal to it.

23517
06:24:12,300 --> 06:24:12,920
Wickham will soon

23518
06:24:12,920 --> 06:24:13,680
be gone.

23519
06:24:13,680 --> 06:24:14,300
And therefore,

23520
06:24:14,300 --> 06:24:14,660
it will not.

23521
06:24:14,660 --> 06:24:15,240
Signify

23522
06:24:15,240 --> 06:24:15,780
anyone here what.

23523
06:24:15,780 --> 06:24:16,920
He really is.

23524
06:24:16,920 --> 06:24:17,780
Sometime hence,

23525
06:24:17,780 --> 06:24:18,080
it will all

23526
06:24:18,080 --> 06:24:19,140
be found out.

23527
06:24:19,140 --> 06:24:20,000
And then make me laugh

23528
06:24:20,000 --> 06:24:20,820
at that stupidity

23529
06:24:20,820 --> 06:24:21,180
and not

23530
06:24:21,180 --> 06:24:22,380
knowing it before.

23531
06:24:22,520 --> 06:24:23,540
At present, I will say

23532
06:24:23,540 --> 06:24:24,740
nothing about it.

23533
06:24:25,220 --> 06:24:26,420
You are quite right.

23534
06:24:26,760 --> 06:24:27,980
To have his errors made

23535
06:24:27,980 --> 06:24:28,400
public

23536
06:24:28,400 --> 06:24:29,600
might ruin him forever.

23537
06:24:30,120 --> 06:24:31,020
He is now perhaps

23538
06:24:31,020 --> 06:24:31,620
sorry for what

23539
06:24:31,620 --> 06:24:33,120
he has done and anxious.

23540
06:24:33,120 --> 06:24:33,840
To reestablish.

23541
06:24:33,840 --> 06:24:34,800
Character.

23542
06:24:34,800 --> 06:24:35,160
We must

23543
06:24:35,160 --> 06:24:36,420
not make him desperate.

23544
06:24:37,460 --> 06:24:38,160
The tumult of

23545
06:24:38,160 --> 06:24:39,060
Elizabeth's mind

23546
06:24:39,060 --> 06:24:39,620
was allayed

23547
06:24:39,620 --> 06:24:40,820
by this conversation.

23548
06:24:41,040 --> 06:24:41,880
She had got rid of

23549
06:24:41,880 --> 06:24:42,740
two of the secrets

23550
06:24:42,740 --> 06:24:43,520
which had weighed on her

23551
06:24:43,520 --> 06:24:44,540
for a fortnight

23552
06:24:44,540 --> 06:24:45,240
and was certain

23553
06:24:45,240 --> 06:24:45,680
of a willing

23554
06:24:45,680 --> 06:24:46,820
listener in Jane

23555
06:24:46,820 --> 06:24:47,880
whenever she might wish

23556
06:24:47,880 --> 06:24:49,140
to talk again of either.

23557
06:24:49,700 --> 06:24:50,120
But there was

23558
06:24:50,120 --> 06:24:50,840
still something

23559
06:24:50,840 --> 06:24:52,040
lurking behind,

23560
06:24:52,040 --> 06:24:52,980
of which prudence

23561
06:24:52,980 --> 06:24:54,180
forbade the disclosure.

23562
06:24:54,560 --> 06:24:55,400
She dared not

23563
06:24:55,400 --> 06:24:56,100
relate the other

23564
06:24:56,100 --> 06:24:56,700
half of Mr.

23565
06:24:56,700 --> 06:24:57,780
Darcy's letter,

23566
06:24:57,780 --> 06:24:58,520
nor explain

23567
06:24:58,520 --> 06:24:59,120
to her sister

23568
06:24:59,120 --> 06:24:59,840
how sincerely

23569
06:24:59,840 --> 06:25:00,720
she'd been valued

23570
06:25:00,720 --> 06:25:01,920
by her friend.

23571
06:25:02,060 --> 06:25:03,020
Here was knowledge

23572
06:25:03,020 --> 06:25:04,220
in which no one could,

23573
06:25:04,820 --> 06:25:05,760
and she was sensible

23574
06:25:05,760 --> 06:25:06,440
that nothing less

23575
06:25:06,440 --> 06:25:07,040
than a perfect

23576
06:25:07,040 --> 06:25:07,740
understanding

23577
06:25:07,740 --> 06:25:08,840
between the parties

23578
06:25:08,840 --> 06:25:09,780
could justify her

23579
06:25:09,780 --> 06:25:10,400
and throwing off

23580
06:25:10,400 --> 06:25:10,880
this last

23581
06:25:10,880 --> 06:25:12,120
encumbrance of mystery.

23582
06:25:12,860 --> 06:25:14,480
And then said she,

23583
06:25:14,940 --> 06:25:15,720
if that very

23584
06:25:15,720 --> 06:25:16,560
improbable event.

23585
06:25:16,560 --> 06:25:17,760
Should ever take place.

23586
06:25:17,760 --> 06:25:18,440
I shall merely

23587
06:25:18,440 --> 06:25:19,380
be able to tell what.

23588
06:25:19,380 --> 06:25:20,100
Bingley may tell

23589
06:25:20,100 --> 06:25:21,080
in a much more agreeable

23590
06:25:21,080 --> 06:25:22,260
manner. Himself.

23591
06:25:22,260 --> 06:25:22,820
The liberty

23592
06:25:22,820 --> 06:25:23,940
of communication

23593
06:25:23,940 --> 06:25:24,800
be mine till it has

23594
06:25:24,800 --> 06:25:26,160
lost all its value.

23595
06:25:27,240 --> 06:25:27,900
She was now.

23596
06:25:27,900 --> 06:25:29,100
On being settled at home

23597
06:25:29,180 --> 06:25:29,840
at leisure,

23598
06:25:29,840 --> 06:25:30,360
to observe

23599
06:25:30,360 --> 06:25:31,020
the real state

23600
06:25:31,020 --> 06:25:32,220
of her sister's spirits.

23601
06:25:32,640 --> 06:25:33,920
Jane was not happy.

23602
06:25:34,320 --> 06:25:35,280
She still cherished

23603
06:25:35,280 --> 06:25:36,480
a very tender affection

23604
06:25:36,480 --> 06:25:37,760
for Bingley, having

23605
06:25:37,760 --> 06:25:38,300
never even

23606
06:25:38,300 --> 06:25:39,060
fancied herself

23607
06:25:39,060 --> 06:25:40,200
in love before.

23608
06:25:40,200 --> 06:25:40,980
Her regard at all

23609
06:25:40,980 --> 06:25:41,480
the warmth of

23610
06:25:41,480 --> 06:25:42,680
first attachment,

23611
06:25:42,740 --> 06:25:43,580
and from her age

23612
06:25:43,580 --> 06:25:44,660
and disposition

23613
06:25:44,660 --> 06:25:45,680
greater steadiness

23614
06:25:45,680 --> 06:25:46,140
than most.

23615
06:25:46,140 --> 06:25:47,040
First attachments

23616
06:25:47,040 --> 06:25:48,240
often boast.

23617
06:25:48,240 --> 06:25:49,320
And so fervently did

23618
06:25:49,320 --> 06:25:49,860
she value

23619
06:25:49,860 --> 06:25:50,820
his remembrance

23620
06:25:50,820 --> 06:25:51,600
and prefer him

23621
06:25:51,600 --> 06:25:52,800
to every other man

23622
06:25:52,820 --> 06:25:54,120
that her good sense

23623
06:25:54,240 --> 06:25:55,320
and all her attention

23624
06:25:55,320 --> 06:25:55,880
to the feelings

23625
06:25:55,880 --> 06:25:56,780
of her friends

23626
06:25:56,780 --> 06:25:57,900
were requisite to check

23627
06:25:57,900 --> 06:25:58,700
the indulgence

23628
06:25:58,700 --> 06:25:59,420
of those regrets,

23629
06:25:59,420 --> 06:25:59,900
which must have

23630
06:25:59,900 --> 06:26:00,680
been injurious

23631
06:26:00,680 --> 06:26:01,500
to her own health

23632
06:26:01,500 --> 06:26:02,700
and their tranquility.

23633
06:26:03,660 --> 06:26:05,220
Well, as he said, Mrs.

23634
06:26:05,220 --> 06:26:06,420
Bennet, one day,

23635
06:26:06,420 --> 06:26:07,260
what is your opinion.

23636
06:26:07,260 --> 06:26:08,040
Now of the sad

23637
06:26:08,040 --> 06:26:09,140
business of Jane's?

23638
06:26:09,140 --> 06:26:09,900
For my part,

23639
06:26:09,900 --> 06:26:10,500
I am determined

23640
06:26:10,500 --> 06:26:11,000
never to speak

23641
06:26:11,000 --> 06:26:12,200
of it again to anybody.

23642
06:26:12,320 --> 06:26:13,560
I my sister Philip.

23643
06:26:13,560 --> 06:26:14,700
So the other day.

23644
06:26:14,700 --> 06:26:15,620
But I cannot find out

23645
06:26:15,620 --> 06:26:16,080
the chains

23646
06:26:16,080 --> 06:26:16,980
or anything of him

23647
06:26:16,980 --> 06:26:18,080
in London.

23648
06:26:18,080 --> 06:26:19,020
Well, he's

23649
06:26:19,020 --> 06:26:20,000
a very undeserving

23650
06:26:20,000 --> 06:26:20,720
young man,

23651
06:26:20,720 --> 06:26:21,620
and I do not suppose

23652
06:26:21,620 --> 06:26:21,800
there is

23653
06:26:21,800 --> 06:26:22,560
the least chance

23654
06:26:22,560 --> 06:26:23,060
in the world

23655
06:26:23,060 --> 06:26:23,340
for ever

23656
06:26:23,340 --> 06:26:24,380
getting him now.

23657
06:26:24,380 --> 06:26:25,320
There is no talk of you

23658
06:26:25,320 --> 06:26:25,640
coming to

23659
06:26:25,640 --> 06:26:26,280
Netherfield again

23660
06:26:26,280 --> 06:26:27,060
in the summer,

23661
06:26:27,060 --> 06:26:27,800
and I've inquired

23662
06:26:27,800 --> 06:26:28,620
of everybody to.

23663
06:26:28,620 --> 06:26:29,700
Who is likely to know.

23664
06:26:30,720 --> 06:26:31,320
I do not

23665
06:26:31,320 --> 06:26:31,800
believe you will

23666
06:26:31,800 --> 06:26:32,660
ever live at Netherfield

23667
06:26:32,660 --> 06:26:33,860
any more.

23668
06:26:33,920 --> 06:26:35,140
Oh, well, just.

23669
06:26:35,160 --> 06:26:36,360
Just as he chooses.

23670
06:26:36,420 --> 06:26:37,260
Nobody wants him

23671
06:26:37,260 --> 06:26:38,180
to come.

23672
06:26:38,180 --> 06:26:38,360
Though

23673
06:26:38,360 --> 06:26:39,240
I shall always say

23674
06:26:39,240 --> 06:26:40,160
he used my daughter

23675
06:26:40,160 --> 06:26:41,360
extremely ill.

23676
06:26:41,360 --> 06:26:42,240
And if I was her,

23677
06:26:42,240 --> 06:26:42,720
I would not have

23678
06:26:42,720 --> 06:26:43,920
put up with it.

23679
06:26:43,980 --> 06:26:44,580
Well,

23680
06:26:44,580 --> 06:26:45,780
I comfort, as I am sure

23681
06:26:45,780 --> 06:26:46,140
Jane will

23682
06:26:46,140 --> 06:26:47,340
die of a broken heart.

23683
06:26:47,400 --> 06:26:47,700
And then

23684
06:26:47,700 --> 06:26:48,300
he would be sorry

23685
06:26:48,300 --> 06:26:49,500
for what he has done.

23686
06:26:49,940 --> 06:26:50,600
But Elizabeth

23687
06:26:50,600 --> 06:26:51,240
could not receive

23688
06:26:51,240 --> 06:26:51,920
comfort from.

23689
06:26:51,920 --> 06:26:53,120
Such expectation,

23690
06:26:53,180 --> 06:26:53,460
and she.

23691
06:26:53,460 --> 06:26:54,660
Made no answer.

23692
06:26:55,260 --> 06:26:56,280
Well, Lizzie.

23693
06:26:56,280 --> 06:26:57,120
Continued her mother

23694
06:26:57,120 --> 06:26:58,200
soon afterwards.

23695
06:26:58,200 --> 06:26:59,220
So the Collins is

23696
06:26:59,220 --> 06:26:59,900
very comfortable.

23697
06:26:59,900 --> 06:27:01,100
Do they? Well.

23698
06:27:01,100 --> 06:27:02,040
Well I only

23699
06:27:02,040 --> 06:27:03,240
hope it will last.

23700
06:27:03,280 --> 06:27:03,560
And what

23701
06:27:03,560 --> 06:27:04,280
sort of table do

23702
06:27:04,280 --> 06:27:05,040
they keep?

23703
06:27:05,040 --> 06:27:05,700
Charlotte is an

23704
06:27:05,700 --> 06:27:06,680
excellent manager,

23705
06:27:06,680 --> 06:27:07,800
I daresay.

23706
06:27:07,800 --> 06:27:09,060
If she is half as sharp

23707
06:27:09,060 --> 06:27:09,620
as her mother,

23708
06:27:09,620 --> 06:27:10,780
she is saving enough.

23709
06:27:10,780 --> 06:27:11,000
There's

23710
06:27:11,000 --> 06:27:11,840
nothing extravagant

23711
06:27:11,840 --> 06:27:12,840
in their housekeeping,

23712
06:27:12,840 --> 06:27:14,040
I daresay.

23713
06:27:14,360 --> 06:27:15,560
No, nothing at all.

23714
06:27:16,160 --> 06:27:16,940
A great deal

23715
06:27:16,940 --> 06:27:17,700
of good management

23716
06:27:17,700 --> 06:27:18,900
depend upon it.

23717
06:27:18,960 --> 06:27:19,800
Yes. Yes.

23718
06:27:19,800 --> 06:27:20,940
They will take care

23719
06:27:20,940 --> 06:27:22,140
to outrun their income.

23720
06:27:22,280 --> 06:27:22,800
They will

23721
06:27:22,800 --> 06:27:23,520
never be distressed

23722
06:27:23,520 --> 06:27:24,380
for money.

23723
06:27:24,380 --> 06:27:25,220
Well, much good.

23724
06:27:25,220 --> 06:27:26,240
May it do them.

23725
06:27:26,240 --> 06:27:27,200
And so I suppose

23726
06:27:27,200 --> 06:27:27,900
they often talk

23727
06:27:27,900 --> 06:27:28,740
of having no known born

23728
06:27:28,740 --> 06:27:29,240
when your father

23729
06:27:29,240 --> 06:27:30,020
is dead.

23730
06:27:30,020 --> 06:27:30,720
They look upon it

23731
06:27:30,720 --> 06:27:31,520
quite as their own,

23732
06:27:31,520 --> 06:27:31,820
I dare

23733
06:27:31,820 --> 06:27:32,400
say, whenever

23734
06:27:32,400 --> 06:27:33,060
that happens.

23735
06:27:34,080 --> 06:27:35,160
It was a subject which

23736
06:27:35,160 --> 06:27:36,080
they could not mention

23737
06:27:36,080 --> 06:27:37,280
before me.

23738
06:27:37,580 --> 06:27:38,360
No,

23739
06:27:38,360 --> 06:27:38,640
it would have

23740
06:27:38,640 --> 06:27:39,320
been strange

23741
06:27:39,320 --> 06:27:40,280
if they had.

23742
06:27:40,280 --> 06:27:41,420
But I make no doubt

23743
06:27:41,420 --> 06:27:42,320
they often talk of it

23744
06:27:42,320 --> 06:27:43,520
between themselves.

23745
06:27:43,740 --> 06:27:44,480
Well,

23746
06:27:44,480 --> 06:27:45,600
if they can be easy

23747
06:27:45,600 --> 06:27:46,140
with an estate

23748
06:27:46,140 --> 06:27:46,560
that is not

23749
06:27:46,560 --> 06:27:47,420
lawfully their own.

23750
06:27:47,420 --> 06:27:48,620
So much the better.

23751
06:27:48,840 --> 06:27:49,880
I should be ashamed

23752
06:27:49,880 --> 06:27:50,340
of having one

23753
06:27:50,340 --> 06:27:50,820
that was only

23754
06:27:50,820 --> 06:27:52,020
entailed on me.

23755
06:27:53,340 --> 06:27:54,540
Chapter 41

23756
06:27:55,760 --> 06:27:56,580
The first week

23757
06:27:56,580 --> 06:27:57,320
of their return

23758
06:27:57,320 --> 06:27:58,340
was soon gone.

23759
06:27:58,340 --> 06:27:59,580
The second began.

23760
06:27:59,880 --> 06:28:00,780
It was the last

23761
06:28:00,780 --> 06:28:01,400
of the regiment

23762
06:28:01,400 --> 06:28:02,600
stay in Meriton

23763
06:28:02,660 --> 06:28:03,840
and all the young ladies

23764
06:28:03,840 --> 06:28:04,520
in the neighborhood

23765
06:28:04,520 --> 06:28:05,720
were drooping apace.

23766
06:28:06,080 --> 06:28:07,020
The dejection was

23767
06:28:07,020 --> 06:28:08,400
almost universal.

23768
06:28:08,760 --> 06:28:10,100
The elder Miss Bennetts

23769
06:28:10,100 --> 06:28:11,360
alone were still able

23770
06:28:11,360 --> 06:28:12,840
to eat, drink and sleep

23771
06:28:12,840 --> 06:28:13,380
and pursue

23772
06:28:13,380 --> 06:28:14,300
the usual course

23773
06:28:14,300 --> 06:28:15,500
of their employments

23774
06:28:15,720 --> 06:28:16,640
very frequently.

23775
06:28:16,640 --> 06:28:17,520
Were they reproached

23776
06:28:17,520 --> 06:28:18,800
for this insensibility

23777
06:28:18,800 --> 06:28:20,000
by, Kitty and Lydia,

23778
06:28:20,180 --> 06:28:20,720
whose own

23779
06:28:20,720 --> 06:28:21,920
misery was extreme,

23780
06:28:22,020 --> 06:28:22,520
and who could

23781
06:28:22,520 --> 06:28:24,000
not comprehend such hard

23782
06:28:24,000 --> 06:28:24,620
heartedness

23783
06:28:24,620 --> 06:28:25,820
in any of the family?

23784
06:28:26,580 --> 06:28:27,780
Good heavens.

23785
06:28:27,800 --> 06:28:29,180
What is to become us?

23786
06:28:29,360 --> 06:28:30,740
What are we to do?

23787
06:28:31,040 --> 06:28:32,300
What they often exclaim

23788
06:28:32,300 --> 06:28:32,480
in the

23789
06:28:32,480 --> 06:28:33,680
bitterness of woe.

23790
06:28:33,860 --> 06:28:34,740
How can you be

23791
06:28:34,740 --> 06:28:35,760
so smiling?

23792
06:28:35,760 --> 06:28:36,920
Lizzie?

23793
06:28:36,920 --> 06:28:37,700
Their affectionate

23794
06:28:37,700 --> 06:28:38,400
mother, shared

23795
06:28:38,400 --> 06:28:39,300
all their grief.

23796
06:28:39,300 --> 06:28:39,960
She remembered

23797
06:28:39,960 --> 06:28:40,920
what she had herself

23798
06:28:40,920 --> 06:28:41,460
endured on

23799
06:28:41,460 --> 06:28:42,720
a similar occasion five

23800
06:28:42,720 --> 06:28:43,920
and 20 years ago.

23801
06:28:44,420 --> 06:28:46,800
I am sure, said she.

23802
06:28:47,160 --> 06:28:49,220
I cried for two together

23803
06:28:49,220 --> 06:28:49,740
when Colonel

23804
06:28:49,740 --> 06:28:50,580
Miller's regiment

23805
06:28:50,580 --> 06:28:51,560
went away.

23806
06:28:51,560 --> 06:28:52,460
I thought I should have

23807
06:28:52,460 --> 06:28:53,760
broken my heart.

23808
06:28:54,380 --> 06:28:55,620
I am sure I shall break.

23809
06:28:55,620 --> 06:28:57,240
Mine, said Lydia.

23810
06:28:57,960 --> 06:28:58,980
If could but

23811
06:28:58,980 --> 06:29:00,180
go to Brighton.

23812
06:29:00,480 --> 06:29:01,260
Observed Mrs.

23813
06:29:01,260 --> 06:29:02,240
Bennett.

23814
06:29:02,240 --> 06:29:02,960
Oh, yes,

23815
06:29:02,960 --> 06:29:03,780
if one could but

23816
06:29:03,780 --> 06:29:04,760
go to Brighton.

23817
06:29:04,760 --> 06:29:05,640
But Papa is

23818
06:29:05,640 --> 06:29:07,040
so disagreeable.

23819
06:29:07,740 --> 06:29:09,120
Her little sea bathing,

23820
06:29:09,120 --> 06:29:10,700
which set me up forever.

23821
06:29:11,480 --> 06:29:12,660
And my Aunt Philips

23822
06:29:12,660 --> 06:29:13,520
is sure it would do me

23823
06:29:13,520 --> 06:29:14,720
a great deal of good.

23824
06:29:15,120 --> 06:29:15,980
Added Kitty.

23825
06:29:16,940 --> 06:29:17,460
Such were

23826
06:29:17,460 --> 06:29:18,720
the kind of lamentations

23827
06:29:18,720 --> 06:29:20,000
resounding perpetually

23828
06:29:20,000 --> 06:29:21,200
through long born house.

23829
06:29:21,440 --> 06:29:22,400
Elizabeth tried

23830
06:29:22,400 --> 06:29:23,600
to be diverted by them,

23831
06:29:23,840 --> 06:29:24,620
but all sense

23832
06:29:24,620 --> 06:29:25,700
of pleasure was lost

23833
06:29:25,700 --> 06:29:26,760
and shame.

23834
06:29:26,760 --> 06:29:27,680
She felt anew

23835
06:29:27,680 --> 06:29:28,920
the justice of Mr.

23836
06:29:28,920 --> 06:29:30,120
Darcy's objections

23837
06:29:30,260 --> 06:29:30,860
and never had

23838
06:29:30,860 --> 06:29:31,400
she been so

23839
06:29:31,400 --> 06:29:32,700
much disposed to pardon

23840
06:29:32,700 --> 06:29:33,600
his interference

23841
06:29:33,600 --> 06:29:34,140
in the views

23842
06:29:34,140 --> 06:29:35,340
of his friend.

23843
06:29:35,700 --> 06:29:36,440
But the gloom.

23844
06:29:36,440 --> 06:29:37,560
Of Lydia's prospect

23845
06:29:37,560 --> 06:29:38,160
was shortly

23846
06:29:38,160 --> 06:29:39,380
cleared away, for.

23847
06:29:39,380 --> 06:29:40,140
She received an.

23848
06:29:40,140 --> 06:29:41,180
Invitation from Mrs.

23849
06:29:41,180 --> 06:29:41,940
Forster,

23850
06:29:41,940 --> 06:29:42,980
the wife of the colonel

23851
06:29:42,980 --> 06:29:43,920
of the regiment.

23852
06:29:43,920 --> 06:29:44,060
To.

23853
06:29:44,060 --> 06:29:44,700
Accompany her

23854
06:29:44,700 --> 06:29:45,860
to Brighton.

23855
06:29:45,860 --> 06:29:47,220
This invaluable friend

23856
06:29:47,220 --> 06:29:48,420
was a very young woman

23857
06:29:48,540 --> 06:29:49,860
and very lately married.

23858
06:29:50,180 --> 06:29:51,000
A resemblance

23859
06:29:51,000 --> 06:29:52,080
in good humor and good

23860
06:29:52,080 --> 06:29:53,280
spirits had recommended

23861
06:29:53,280 --> 06:29:53,900
her and Lydia

23862
06:29:53,900 --> 06:29:54,900
to each other.

23863
06:29:54,900 --> 06:29:55,560
And out of their

23864
06:29:55,560 --> 06:29:56,220
three months

23865
06:29:56,220 --> 06:29:56,820
acquaintance,

23866
06:29:56,820 --> 06:29:57,260
they had been.

23867
06:29:57,260 --> 06:29:58,460
Intimate to.

23868
06:29:59,100 --> 06:30:00,140
The rapture of Lydia

23869
06:30:00,140 --> 06:30:01,140
on this occasion.

23870
06:30:01,140 --> 06:30:02,400
Her adoration of Mrs.

23871
06:30:02,400 --> 06:30:03,080
Foster,

23872
06:30:03,080 --> 06:30:04,080
the delight of Mrs.

23873
06:30:04,080 --> 06:30:04,640
Bennett and the.

23874
06:30:04,640 --> 06:30:05,960
Mortification of Kitty.

23875
06:30:06,180 --> 06:30:06,960
Are, scarcely

23876
06:30:06,960 --> 06:30:08,160
to be described

23877
06:30:08,220 --> 06:30:09,320
wholly inattentive

23878
06:30:09,320 --> 06:30:09,620
to her

23879
06:30:09,620 --> 06:30:10,760
sister's feelings.

23880
06:30:10,760 --> 06:30:11,520
Lydia flew

23881
06:30:11,520 --> 06:30:12,180
about the house

23882
06:30:12,180 --> 06:30:13,440
in restless ecstasy,

23883
06:30:13,640 --> 06:30:14,760
calling for everyone's

23884
06:30:14,760 --> 06:30:15,920
congratulations

23885
06:30:15,920 --> 06:30:16,680
and to laughing

23886
06:30:16,680 --> 06:30:17,280
and talking

23887
06:30:17,280 --> 06:30:18,180
with more violence

23888
06:30:18,180 --> 06:30:18,980
than ever.

23889
06:30:18,980 --> 06:30:19,940
Whilst the luckless

23890
06:30:19,940 --> 06:30:20,820
kitty continued

23891
06:30:20,820 --> 06:30:21,480
in the parlor,

23892
06:30:21,480 --> 06:30:22,220
we refined at her

23893
06:30:22,220 --> 06:30:23,060
fate, in terms

23894
06:30:23,060 --> 06:30:24,000
as unreasonable

23895
06:30:24,000 --> 06:30:24,860
as her accent

23896
06:30:24,860 --> 06:30:26,060
was peevish.

23897
06:30:26,480 --> 06:30:27,900
I cannot see why Mrs.

23898
06:30:27,900 --> 06:30:29,420
Foster should not ask me

23899
06:30:29,420 --> 06:30:30,620
as well as Lydia,

23900
06:30:30,680 --> 06:30:31,640
said she,

23901
06:30:31,640 --> 06:30:32,600
though I am not

23902
06:30:32,600 --> 06:30:33,800
a particular friend.

23903
06:30:33,840 --> 06:30:34,460
I have just

23904
06:30:34,460 --> 06:30:35,060
as much right

23905
06:30:35,060 --> 06:30:36,320
to be asked as she has

23906
06:30:36,680 --> 06:30:38,160
and more to for

23907
06:30:38,160 --> 06:30:39,600
I am two years older.

23908
06:30:40,140 --> 06:30:40,800
In vain

23909
06:30:40,800 --> 06:30:41,700
did Elizabeth attempt

23910
06:30:41,700 --> 06:30:42,860
to make her reasonable

23911
06:30:42,860 --> 06:30:43,680
and Jane

23912
06:30:43,680 --> 06:30:45,620
to make her resigned as?

23913
06:30:45,620 --> 06:30:46,820
For Elizabeth herself?

23914
06:30:46,860 --> 06:30:47,720
This invitation

23915
06:30:47,720 --> 06:30:48,420
was so far

23916
06:30:48,420 --> 06:30:49,320
from exciting in her

23917
06:30:49,320 --> 06:30:50,120
the same feelings

23918
06:30:50,120 --> 06:30:50,760
as in her mother

23919
06:30:50,760 --> 06:30:51,540
and Lydia

23920
06:30:51,540 --> 06:30:52,460
that she considered it

23921
06:30:52,460 --> 06:30:53,400
as the death warrant

23922
06:30:53,400 --> 06:30:54,320
of all possibility

23923
06:30:54,320 --> 06:30:54,780
of common

23924
06:30:54,780 --> 06:30:55,980
sense for latter

23925
06:30:56,040 --> 06:30:57,360
and detestable as such,

23926
06:30:57,360 --> 06:30:57,740
a step

23927
06:30:57,740 --> 06:30:58,460
must make her

23928
06:30:58,460 --> 06:30:59,400
worth known.

23929
06:30:59,400 --> 06:31:00,020
She could not

23930
06:31:00,020 --> 06:31:00,780
help secretly

23931
06:31:00,780 --> 06:31:01,800
advising her father

23932
06:31:01,800 --> 06:31:03,000
not to let her go.

23933
06:31:03,360 --> 06:31:04,620
She represented to him

23934
06:31:04,620 --> 06:31:05,820
all the improprieties

23935
06:31:05,820 --> 06:31:06,300
of Lydia's

23936
06:31:06,300 --> 06:31:07,500
general behavior,

23937
06:31:07,500 --> 06:31:08,460
the little advantage

23938
06:31:08,460 --> 06:31:09,140
she could derive

23939
06:31:09,140 --> 06:31:09,800
from the friendship

23940
06:31:09,800 --> 06:31:10,860
of such a woman as Mrs.

23941
06:31:10,860 --> 06:31:11,600
Foster

23942
06:31:11,600 --> 06:31:12,680
and the probability

23943
06:31:12,680 --> 06:31:13,040
of her

23944
06:31:13,040 --> 06:31:14,340
being yet more imprudent

23945
06:31:14,340 --> 06:31:15,240
with such a companion

23946
06:31:15,240 --> 06:31:16,020
at Brighton,

23947
06:31:16,020 --> 06:31:16,980
where the temptations

23948
06:31:16,980 --> 06:31:17,340
must be

23949
06:31:17,340 --> 06:31:18,540
greater than at home.

23950
06:31:18,920 --> 06:31:20,400
He heard her attentively

23951
06:31:20,400 --> 06:31:21,600
and then said.

23952
06:31:21,960 --> 06:31:23,460
Lydia will never be easy

23953
06:31:23,460 --> 06:31:24,020
until she has

23954
06:31:24,020 --> 06:31:25,220
exposed herself

23955
06:31:25,220 --> 06:31:25,920
some public

23956
06:31:25,920 --> 06:31:27,240
place or other, and

23957
06:31:27,240 --> 06:31:27,740
we can never

23958
06:31:27,740 --> 06:31:28,580
expect it to do it

23959
06:31:28,580 --> 06:31:29,720
with so little expense

23960
06:31:29,720 --> 06:31:30,480
or inconvenience

23961
06:31:30,480 --> 06:31:31,500
to her family.

23962
06:31:31,500 --> 06:31:31,940
As under the

23963
06:31:31,940 --> 06:31:33,260
present circumstances.

23964
06:31:34,260 --> 06:31:35,480
If you were aware.

23965
06:31:35,760 --> 06:31:36,740
Said Elizabeth.

23966
06:31:36,740 --> 06:31:37,040
Of the

23967
06:31:37,040 --> 06:31:38,600
very great disadvantage

23968
06:31:38,600 --> 06:31:39,080
to us all,

23969
06:31:39,080 --> 06:31:39,920
which must arise.

23970
06:31:39,920 --> 06:31:40,560
From the public

23971
06:31:40,560 --> 06:31:41,520
notice of Lydia's.

23972
06:31:41,520 --> 06:31:42,320
Unguarded

23973
06:31:42,320 --> 06:31:43,520
and imprudent manner

23974
06:31:44,000 --> 06:31:44,760
nay, which has

23975
06:31:44,760 --> 06:31:45,960
already arisen from it.

23976
06:31:46,280 --> 06:31:46,980
I am sure you would

23977
06:31:46,980 --> 06:31:47,720
judge differently

23978
06:31:47,720 --> 06:31:48,920
in this affair

23979
06:31:49,260 --> 06:31:50,460
already arisen.

23980
06:31:51,000 --> 06:31:51,740
Repeated Mr.

23981
06:31:51,740 --> 06:31:52,880
Bennett.

23982
06:31:52,880 --> 06:31:53,900
What has she

23983
06:31:53,900 --> 06:31:54,600
frightened away

23984
06:31:54,600 --> 06:31:55,580
some of your lovers?

23985
06:31:55,580 --> 06:31:56,720
Poor little Lizzie.

23986
06:31:56,720 --> 06:31:58,340
But do not be cast down.

23987
06:31:58,820 --> 06:31:59,760
Such squeamish

23988
06:31:59,760 --> 06:32:00,980
youths as cannot bear

23989
06:32:00,980 --> 06:32:01,700
to be connected

23990
06:32:01,700 --> 06:32:02,940
with a little absurdity

23991
06:32:02,940 --> 06:32:04,240
and not worth a regret.

23992
06:32:04,740 --> 06:32:05,360
Come,

23993
06:32:05,360 --> 06:32:05,820
let me see

23994
06:32:05,820 --> 06:32:06,380
the list of the

23995
06:32:06,380 --> 06:32:07,260
pitiful fellows

23996
06:32:07,260 --> 06:32:07,880
who have been kept

23997
06:32:07,880 --> 06:32:09,300
aloof by Lydia's folly.

23998
06:32:09,740 --> 06:32:10,220
Indeed,

23999
06:32:10,220 --> 06:32:11,400
you are mistaken.

24000
06:32:11,400 --> 06:32:12,360
I have no such

24001
06:32:12,360 --> 06:32:13,560
injuries to resent.

24002
06:32:13,760 --> 06:32:15,020
It Is not of particular,

24003
06:32:15,020 --> 06:32:16,380
but of general evils,

24004
06:32:16,380 --> 06:32:17,040
which I am now

24005
06:32:17,040 --> 06:32:18,240
complaining.

24006
06:32:18,300 --> 06:32:19,340
Our importance,

24007
06:32:19,340 --> 06:32:20,580
our respectability

24008
06:32:20,580 --> 06:32:21,020
in the world

24009
06:32:21,020 --> 06:32:21,800
must be affected.

24010
06:32:21,800 --> 06:32:22,560
By the wild.

24011
06:32:22,560 --> 06:32:23,580
Volatility,

24012
06:32:23,580 --> 06:32:24,300
the assurance

24013
06:32:24,300 --> 06:32:25,080
and disdain

24014
06:32:25,080 --> 06:32:25,980
of all restraint.

24015
06:32:25,980 --> 06:32:26,540
Which marks

24016
06:32:26,540 --> 06:32:27,500
Lydia's character.

24017
06:32:28,460 --> 06:32:29,480
Excuse me for I

24018
06:32:29,480 --> 06:32:30,900
must speak plainly.

24019
06:32:31,500 --> 06:32:33,300
If you, my dear father,

24020
06:32:33,300 --> 06:32:33,740
will not

24021
06:32:33,740 --> 06:32:34,440
take the trouble

24022
06:32:34,440 --> 06:32:35,040
of checking her

24023
06:32:35,040 --> 06:32:36,240
exuberant spirits

24024
06:32:36,320 --> 06:32:37,280
and of teaching her

24025
06:32:37,280 --> 06:32:37,520
that her

24026
06:32:37,520 --> 06:32:38,420
present pursuits

24027
06:32:38,420 --> 06:32:38,940
are not to be

24028
06:32:38,940 --> 06:32:39,480
to the business

24029
06:32:39,480 --> 06:32:40,280
of her life,

24030
06:32:40,280 --> 06:32:41,600
she will soon be beyond

24031
06:32:41,600 --> 06:32:42,800
the reach of amendment.

24032
06:32:43,200 --> 06:32:43,880
Her character

24033
06:32:43,880 --> 06:32:44,660
will be fixed,

24034
06:32:44,660 --> 06:32:46,200
and she will, at 16,

24035
06:32:46,220 --> 06:32:46,860
be the most

24036
06:32:46,860 --> 06:32:48,020
determined flirt

24037
06:32:48,020 --> 06:32:49,100
that ever made herself

24038
06:32:49,100 --> 06:32:49,800
or her family

24039
06:32:49,800 --> 06:32:51,000
ridiculous.

24040
06:32:51,180 --> 06:32:51,680
A flat

24041
06:32:51,680 --> 06:32:52,460
to in the worst

24042
06:32:52,460 --> 06:32:53,060
and meanest

24043
06:32:53,060 --> 06:32:54,260
degree of flirtation.

24044
06:32:54,380 --> 06:32:55,760
Without any attraction

24045
06:32:55,760 --> 06:32:56,540
beyond youth

24046
06:32:56,540 --> 06:32:57,840
and a tolerable person.

24047
06:32:58,220 --> 06:32:59,300
And from the ignorance

24048
06:32:59,300 --> 06:33:00,000
and emptiness

24049
06:33:00,000 --> 06:33:00,540
of her mind,

24050
06:33:00,540 --> 06:33:01,320
wholly unable

24051
06:33:01,320 --> 06:33:02,700
to ward off any portion

24052
06:33:02,700 --> 06:33:02,940
of that

24053
06:33:02,940 --> 06:33:04,140
universal contempt

24054
06:33:04,260 --> 06:33:05,040
which her rage

24055
06:33:05,040 --> 06:33:05,700
for admiration

24056
06:33:05,700 --> 06:33:06,900
will excite.

24057
06:33:07,080 --> 06:33:08,340
And this danger, Kitty,

24058
06:33:08,340 --> 06:33:09,740
also is comprehended.

24059
06:33:10,040 --> 06:33:10,860
She will follow

24060
06:33:10,860 --> 06:33:12,060
wherever lady leads

24061
06:33:12,320 --> 06:33:13,340
vain, ignorant,

24062
06:33:13,340 --> 06:33:14,720
idle and, Absolutely

24063
06:33:14,720 --> 06:33:15,920
uncontrolled.

24064
06:33:16,200 --> 06:33:16,940
Oh, my dear

24065
06:33:16,940 --> 06:33:17,400
father,

24066
06:33:17,400 --> 06:33:18,200
can you suppose it

24067
06:33:18,200 --> 06:33:18,720
possible

24068
06:33:18,720 --> 06:33:19,100
that they will

24069
06:33:19,100 --> 06:33:20,120
not be censured

24070
06:33:20,120 --> 06:33:20,840
and despised.

24071
06:33:20,840 --> 06:33:21,920
Wherever they are known.

24072
06:33:21,920 --> 06:33:22,920
And that their sisters

24073
06:33:22,920 --> 06:33:23,660
will not be often

24074
06:33:23,660 --> 06:33:24,300
involved in

24075
06:33:24,300 --> 06:33:25,220
the disgrace?

24076
06:33:26,180 --> 06:33:26,540
Mr.

24077
06:33:26,540 --> 06:33:27,480
Bennett saw that her

24078
06:33:27,480 --> 06:33:28,100
whole heart

24079
06:33:28,100 --> 06:33:29,240
was in the subject

24080
06:33:29,240 --> 06:33:30,080
and affectionately

24081
06:33:30,080 --> 06:33:30,560
taking her

24082
06:33:30,560 --> 06:33:31,800
hand, said in reply.

24083
06:33:32,360 --> 06:33:33,380
Do not make yourself

24084
06:33:33,380 --> 06:33:34,580
uneasy, my love.

24085
06:33:34,940 --> 06:33:35,700
Wherever you and

24086
06:33:35,700 --> 06:33:36,420
Jane are known,

24087
06:33:36,420 --> 06:33:37,520
you must be respected

24088
06:33:37,520 --> 06:33:38,720
and valued

24089
06:33:39,020 --> 06:33:39,900
and you will not appear

24090
06:33:39,900 --> 06:33:40,820
to less advantage

24091
06:33:40,820 --> 06:33:42,020
for having a couple of

24092
06:33:42,680 --> 06:33:43,860
or I may say three

24093
06:33:43,860 --> 06:33:45,060
very silly sisters.

24094
06:33:45,780 --> 06:33:46,860
We shall have no peace

24095
06:33:46,860 --> 06:33:47,700
at long bonnets.

24096
06:33:47,700 --> 06:33:48,500
Lydia does not

24097
06:33:48,500 --> 06:33:49,700
go to Brighton.

24098
06:33:49,980 --> 06:33:51,180
Let her go then.

24099
06:33:51,600 --> 06:33:52,020
Colonel

24100
06:33:52,020 --> 06:33:53,280
Foster is a sensible

24101
06:33:53,280 --> 06:33:53,900
man and will

24102
06:33:53,900 --> 06:33:54,500
keep her out

24103
06:33:54,500 --> 06:33:55,700
of any real mischief.

24104
06:33:55,860 --> 06:33:56,760
And she is luckily

24105
06:33:56,760 --> 06:33:57,360
too poor

24106
06:33:57,360 --> 06:33:58,460
to be an object of prey

24107
06:33:58,460 --> 06:34:00,380
to anybody at Brighton.

24108
06:34:00,620 --> 06:34:01,280
She will be of

24109
06:34:01,280 --> 06:34:02,160
less importance,

24110
06:34:02,160 --> 06:34:03,420
even as a common flirt,

24111
06:34:03,420 --> 06:34:04,620
than she has been here.

24112
06:34:05,220 --> 06:34:06,380
The officers will find

24113
06:34:06,380 --> 06:34:06,920
women

24114
06:34:06,920 --> 06:34:07,580
better worth

24115
06:34:07,580 --> 06:34:08,700
their notice.

24116
06:34:08,700 --> 06:34:09,900
Let us hope, therefore,

24117
06:34:10,160 --> 06:34:11,060
that her being there

24118
06:34:11,060 --> 06:34:11,660
may teach her

24119
06:34:11,660 --> 06:34:13,100
her own insignificance.

24120
06:34:13,400 --> 06:34:14,060
At any rate,

24121
06:34:14,060 --> 06:34:14,720
she cannot grow

24122
06:34:14,720 --> 06:34:15,920
many degrees worse

24123
06:34:15,980 --> 06:34:17,280
without authorizing us

24124
06:34:17,280 --> 06:34:17,960
to lock her up

24125
06:34:17,960 --> 06:34:18,440
for the rest

24126
06:34:18,440 --> 06:34:19,320
of her life.

24127
06:34:19,320 --> 06:34:20,280
With this answer,

24128
06:34:20,280 --> 06:34:21,480
Elizabeth was forced

24129
06:34:21,480 --> 06:34:22,400
to be content.

24130
06:34:22,400 --> 06:34:23,460
But her own

24131
06:34:23,460 --> 06:34:24,660
continued the same,

24132
06:34:24,660 --> 06:34:25,500
and she left him

24133
06:34:25,500 --> 06:34:26,940
disappointed and sorry

24134
06:34:27,320 --> 06:34:27,860
it was not

24135
06:34:27,860 --> 06:34:28,740
in her nature, however,

24136
06:34:28,740 --> 06:34:29,240
to increase

24137
06:34:29,240 --> 06:34:29,960
her vexations

24138
06:34:29,960 --> 06:34:31,160
by dwelling on them.

24139
06:34:31,160 --> 06:34:31,500
She was.

24140
06:34:31,500 --> 06:34:32,400
Confident of having

24141
06:34:32,400 --> 06:34:32,940
performed her.

24142
06:34:32,940 --> 06:34:33,660
Duty.

24143
06:34:33,660 --> 06:34:34,700
And to fret over

24144
06:34:34,700 --> 06:34:35,900
unavoidable evils

24145
06:34:36,020 --> 06:34:36,960
or augment them

24146
06:34:36,960 --> 06:34:38,120
by anxiety.

24147
06:34:38,120 --> 06:34:38,580
Was no.

24148
06:34:38,580 --> 06:34:39,900
Part of her disposition.

24149
06:34:40,980 --> 06:34:41,820
Had Lydia and her

24150
06:34:41,820 --> 06:34:42,320
mother known

24151
06:34:42,320 --> 06:34:42,900
the substance

24152
06:34:42,900 --> 06:34:43,560
of her conference

24153
06:34:43,560 --> 06:34:44,460
with their father,

24154
06:34:44,460 --> 06:34:45,320
their indignation

24155
06:34:45,320 --> 06:34:45,840
would hardly

24156
06:34:45,840 --> 06:34:46,680
have found expression

24157
06:34:46,680 --> 06:34:48,200
in their united ability

24158
06:34:48,560 --> 06:34:49,980
in Lydia's imagination.

24159
06:34:50,180 --> 06:34:51,180
A visit to Brighton

24160
06:34:51,180 --> 06:34:51,720
comprised

24161
06:34:51,720 --> 06:34:52,800
every possibility

24162
06:34:52,800 --> 06:34:54,000
of earthly happiness.

24163
06:34:54,420 --> 06:34:55,020
She saw

24164
06:34:55,020 --> 06:34:55,700
with the creative

24165
06:34:55,700 --> 06:34:56,780
eye of fancy

24166
06:34:56,780 --> 06:34:58,160
the streets of that gay

24167
06:34:58,160 --> 06:34:58,940
bathing. Place.

24168
06:34:58,940 --> 06:35:00,260
Covered with officers.

24169
06:35:00,600 --> 06:35:02,240
She saw herself object.

24170
06:35:02,240 --> 06:35:03,060
Of attention

24171
06:35:03,060 --> 06:35:03,960
to tens and.

24172
06:35:03,960 --> 06:35:04,880
Scores of them

24173
06:35:04,880 --> 06:35:06,080
at present, unknown.

24174
06:35:06,320 --> 06:35:07,100
She saw all

24175
06:35:07,100 --> 06:35:08,300
the glories of the camp,

24176
06:35:08,420 --> 06:35:09,260
its tents

24177
06:35:09,260 --> 06:35:10,140
stretched forth

24178
06:35:10,140 --> 06:35:10,860
and beauteous

24179
06:35:10,860 --> 06:35:12,060
uniformity lines

24180
06:35:12,180 --> 06:35:13,160
crowded with the young

24181
06:35:13,160 --> 06:35:13,760
and the gay

24182
06:35:13,760 --> 06:35:14,520
and dazzling

24183
06:35:14,520 --> 06:35:15,560
with scarlet.

24184
06:35:15,560 --> 06:35:16,560
And to complete the.

24185
06:35:16,560 --> 06:35:18,060
View, she saw herself

24186
06:35:18,060 --> 06:35:19,260
seated beneath a tent.

24187
06:35:19,340 --> 06:35:20,400
Tenderly flirting

24188
06:35:20,400 --> 06:35:20,960
with at least

24189
06:35:20,960 --> 06:35:22,440
six officers at once.

24190
06:35:23,160 --> 06:35:24,120
Had she known, her

24191
06:35:24,120 --> 06:35:24,500
sister

24192
06:35:24,500 --> 06:35:25,640
sought to tear her

24193
06:35:25,640 --> 06:35:26,840
from such prospects

24194
06:35:26,840 --> 06:35:27,900
and such realities

24195
06:35:27,900 --> 06:35:28,640
as these.

24196
06:35:28,640 --> 06:35:29,280
What would have.

24197
06:35:29,280 --> 06:35:29,520
Been her.

24198
06:35:29,520 --> 06:35:30,720
Sensations?

24199
06:35:30,720 --> 06:35:31,220
They could have

24200
06:35:31,220 --> 06:35:32,300
been only understood

24201
06:35:32,300 --> 06:35:33,240
by her mother,

24202
06:35:33,240 --> 06:35:34,020
who might have felt

24203
06:35:34,020 --> 06:35:35,220
nearly the same.

24204
06:35:35,280 --> 06:35:36,120
Lydia is going to

24205
06:35:36,120 --> 06:35:37,080
Brighton was all that

24206
06:35:37,080 --> 06:35:37,940
consoled her for her

24207
06:35:37,940 --> 06:35:38,960
melancholy conviction

24208
06:35:38,960 --> 06:35:39,620
of her husband's

24209
06:35:39,620 --> 06:35:40,440
never intending

24210
06:35:40,440 --> 06:35:41,640
to go there himself.

24211
06:35:42,320 --> 06:35:43,400
But they were entirely

24212
06:35:43,400 --> 06:35:43,940
ignorant of

24213
06:35:43,940 --> 06:35:44,880
what had passed,

24214
06:35:44,880 --> 06:35:45,240
and their

24215
06:35:45,240 --> 06:35:46,440
raptures continued

24216
06:35:46,520 --> 06:35:47,720
with little intermission

24217
06:35:47,880 --> 06:35:48,840
to the very day of

24218
06:35:48,840 --> 06:35:49,860
Lydia's leaving home.

24219
06:35:50,900 --> 06:35:51,620
Elizabeth was

24220
06:35:51,620 --> 06:35:52,400
now to see Mr.

24221
06:35:52,400 --> 06:35:52,740
Wickham

24222
06:35:52,740 --> 06:35:53,940
for the last time,

24223
06:35:54,140 --> 06:35:55,140
having been frequently

24224
06:35:55,140 --> 06:35:55,940
in company with him

24225
06:35:55,940 --> 06:35:57,060
since her return.

24226
06:35:57,060 --> 06:35:57,800
Agitation

24227
06:35:57,800 --> 06:35:58,460
was pretty well

24228
06:35:58,460 --> 06:36:00,120
over the agitations

24229
06:36:00,200 --> 06:36:01,340
formal partiality

24230
06:36:01,340 --> 06:36:02,540
entirely, so.

24231
06:36:02,640 --> 06:36:03,000
She had.

24232
06:36:03,000 --> 06:36:04,100
Even learned to detect

24233
06:36:04,100 --> 06:36:05,120
in the very gentleness

24234
06:36:05,120 --> 06:36:05,820
which had first

24235
06:36:05,820 --> 06:36:06,660
delighted her

24236
06:36:06,660 --> 06:36:07,760
an affectation

24237
06:36:07,760 --> 06:36:08,580
and a sameness

24238
06:36:08,580 --> 06:36:09,860
to disgust and weary

24239
06:36:10,320 --> 06:36:11,120
in his present

24240
06:36:11,120 --> 06:36:12,200
behavior to herself.

24241
06:36:12,200 --> 06:36:12,900
Moreover,

24242
06:36:12,900 --> 06:36:14,100
she had a fresh source

24243
06:36:14,100 --> 06:36:15,140
of displeasure

24244
06:36:15,140 --> 06:36:16,160
for the inclination.

24245
06:36:16,160 --> 06:36:17,160
He soon testified

24246
06:36:17,160 --> 06:36:17,640
of renewing

24247
06:36:17,640 --> 06:36:18,360
those intentions,

24248
06:36:18,360 --> 06:36:18,900
which had marked

24249
06:36:18,900 --> 06:36:20,100
the early part of their

24250
06:36:20,520 --> 06:36:21,620
could only serve

24251
06:36:21,620 --> 06:36:22,140
after what

24252
06:36:22,140 --> 06:36:23,180
had since passed.

24253
06:36:23,180 --> 06:36:24,380
To provoke her,

24254
06:36:24,540 --> 06:36:25,160
she lost

24255
06:36:25,160 --> 06:36:26,040
all concern

24256
06:36:26,040 --> 06:36:26,340
for him

24257
06:36:26,340 --> 06:36:27,200
in finding herself

24258
06:36:27,200 --> 06:36:27,860
thus selected

24259
06:36:27,860 --> 06:36:28,620
as the object

24260
06:36:28,620 --> 06:36:29,600
of such idle

24261
06:36:29,600 --> 06:36:30,900
and frivolous gallantry.

24262
06:36:31,200 --> 06:36:31,760
And while she

24263
06:36:31,760 --> 06:36:32,660
steadily repressed.

24264
06:36:32,660 --> 06:36:33,620
It could not.

24265
06:36:33,620 --> 06:36:34,680
But feel the reproof

24266
06:36:34,680 --> 06:36:35,220
contained

24267
06:36:35,220 --> 06:36:36,300
in his believing

24268
06:36:36,300 --> 06:36:37,380
that however long

24269
06:36:37,380 --> 06:36:38,540
and for whatever cause

24270
06:36:38,540 --> 06:36:39,140
his attentions

24271
06:36:39,140 --> 06:36:40,460
had been withdrawn, her

24272
06:36:40,460 --> 06:36:41,100
vanity would

24273
06:36:41,100 --> 06:36:42,000
be gratified

24274
06:36:42,000 --> 06:36:42,900
and her preference

24275
06:36:42,900 --> 06:36:44,220
secured at any time

24276
06:36:44,220 --> 06:36:45,420
by their renewal.

24277
06:36:45,740 --> 06:36:46,640
On the very last

24278
06:36:46,640 --> 06:36:47,480
day of the regiment's

24279
06:36:47,480 --> 06:36:48,680
remaining at Meriton,

24280
06:36:48,680 --> 06:36:49,280
he dined

24281
06:36:49,280 --> 06:36:50,220
with the other officers

24282
06:36:50,220 --> 06:36:51,300
at Long Bourn,

24283
06:36:51,300 --> 06:36:52,260
and so little was

24284
06:36:52,260 --> 06:36:53,580
Elizabeth disposed apart

24285
06:36:53,580 --> 06:36:54,780
from him in good humor

24286
06:36:54,800 --> 06:36:55,700
that on his making

24287
06:36:55,700 --> 06:36:56,300
some inquiry

24288
06:36:56,300 --> 06:36:56,940
as to the manner

24289
06:36:56,940 --> 06:36:57,600
in which her time

24290
06:36:57,600 --> 06:36:58,160
had passed at

24291
06:36:58,160 --> 06:36:58,980
Hunt's effort,

24292
06:36:58,980 --> 06:36:59,960
she mentioned Colonel

24293
06:36:59,960 --> 06:37:00,980
Fitzwilliams and Mr.

24294
06:37:00,980 --> 06:37:01,700
Darcy's having

24295
06:37:01,700 --> 06:37:02,280
both spent

24296
06:37:02,280 --> 06:37:03,480
three weeks at Raisings

24297
06:37:03,660 --> 06:37:04,380
and asked him

24298
06:37:04,380 --> 06:37:05,100
if he was acquainted

24299
06:37:05,100 --> 06:37:06,300
with the former.

24300
06:37:06,500 --> 06:37:07,700
He looked surprised,

24301
06:37:07,760 --> 06:37:08,900
displeased,

24302
06:37:08,900 --> 06:37:09,860
alarmed.

24303
06:37:09,860 --> 06:37:10,260
But with a.

24304
06:37:10,260 --> 06:37:11,300
Moment's recollection

24305
06:37:11,300 --> 06:37:12,500
and a returning smile,

24306
06:37:12,780 --> 06:37:13,260
replied

24307
06:37:13,260 --> 06:37:14,040
that he had formerly

24308
06:37:14,040 --> 06:37:15,200
seen him often,

24309
06:37:15,200 --> 06:37:16,160
and after observing

24310
06:37:16,160 --> 06:37:16,740
that he was a very

24311
06:37:16,740 --> 06:37:17,940
gentleman like man,

24312
06:37:17,960 --> 06:37:18,480
asked her

24313
06:37:18,480 --> 06:37:19,680
how she had liked him.

24314
06:37:19,860 --> 06:37:20,600
Her answer was

24315
06:37:20,600 --> 06:37:21,800
warmly in his favor

24316
06:37:22,200 --> 06:37:22,760
with an air

24317
06:37:22,760 --> 06:37:23,420
of indifference.

24318
06:37:23,420 --> 06:37:23,780
He soon

24319
06:37:23,780 --> 06:37:24,980
afterwards added.

24320
06:37:25,220 --> 06:37:26,100
How long did you say

24321
06:37:26,100 --> 06:37:27,300
that he was at Rosing?

24322
06:37:27,860 --> 06:37:28,440
Nearly three.

24323
06:37:29,700 --> 06:37:30,200
And you saw

24324
06:37:30,200 --> 06:37:31,400
him frequently?

24325
06:37:31,520 --> 06:37:32,540
Yes, almost

24326
06:37:32,540 --> 06:37:33,740
every day.

24327
06:37:33,900 --> 06:37:34,500
His manners are

24328
06:37:34,500 --> 06:37:35,060
very different

24329
06:37:35,060 --> 06:37:36,260
from his cousins.

24330
06:37:36,720 --> 06:37:38,060
Yes, very different.

24331
06:37:38,760 --> 06:37:40,040
But I think Mr.

24332
06:37:40,040 --> 06:37:41,460
Darcy improves upon

24333
06:37:41,460 --> 06:37:42,660
acquaintance.

24334
06:37:42,920 --> 06:37:44,120
Indeed.

24335
06:37:44,120 --> 06:37:44,760
Cried Mr.

24336
06:37:44,760 --> 06:37:45,540
Wickham with a look

24337
06:37:45,540 --> 06:37:46,020
which did not

24338
06:37:46,020 --> 06:37:46,980
escape her.

24339
06:37:46,980 --> 06:37:47,540
And pray.

24340
06:37:47,540 --> 06:37:48,600
May I?

24341
06:37:48,600 --> 06:37:49,740
But checking himself,

24342
06:37:49,740 --> 06:37:50,240
he added

24343
06:37:50,240 --> 06:37:51,440
in a gay or tone.

24344
06:37:51,440 --> 06:37:52,320
Is it in address

24345
06:37:52,320 --> 06:37:53,520
that he improves?

24346
06:37:53,520 --> 06:37:54,440
Has he deigned to add

24347
06:37:54,440 --> 06:37:55,400
aught of civility

24348
06:37:55,400 --> 06:37:56,600
to his ordinary style?

24349
06:37:56,900 --> 06:37:58,080
For I dare not hope.

24350
06:37:58,080 --> 06:37:59,360
He continued in a lower

24351
06:37:59,360 --> 06:38:00,600
and more serious tone.

24352
06:38:00,980 --> 06:38:01,980
That he has improved

24353
06:38:01,980 --> 06:38:03,020
in essentials.

24354
06:38:03,020 --> 06:38:03,980
Oh, no,

24355
06:38:03,980 --> 06:38:05,000
said Elizabeth.

24356
06:38:05,000 --> 06:38:05,700
In essentials,

24357
06:38:05,700 --> 06:38:06,200
I believe

24358
06:38:06,200 --> 06:38:07,040
he is very much

24359
06:38:07,040 --> 06:38:08,240
what ever was.

24360
06:38:09,080 --> 06:38:10,200
While she spoke,

24361
06:38:10,200 --> 06:38:10,580
Wickham.

24362
06:38:10,580 --> 06:38:11,700
Looked as if scarcely

24363
06:38:11,700 --> 06:38:12,000
knowing

24364
06:38:12,000 --> 06:38:12,780
whether to rejoice

24365
06:38:12,780 --> 06:38:13,680
over her words

24366
06:38:13,680 --> 06:38:14,000
or to

24367
06:38:14,000 --> 06:38:15,240
distrust their meaning.

24368
06:38:15,660 --> 06:38:16,440
There was a something

24369
06:38:16,440 --> 06:38:17,360
in her countenance

24370
06:38:17,360 --> 06:38:17,700
made him

24371
06:38:17,700 --> 06:38:18,000
listen

24372
06:38:18,000 --> 06:38:18,960
with an apprehensive

24373
06:38:18,960 --> 06:38:20,160
and anxious attention.

24374
06:38:20,300 --> 06:38:21,500
While she added,

24375
06:38:21,980 --> 06:38:22,980
When I said that

24376
06:38:22,980 --> 06:38:23,600
he improved

24377
06:38:23,600 --> 06:38:24,680
on acquaintance,

24378
06:38:24,680 --> 06:38:25,700
I did not mean that

24379
06:38:25,700 --> 06:38:26,540
his mind or his.

24380
06:38:26,540 --> 06:38:27,180
Manners were

24381
06:38:27,180 --> 06:38:27,660
in a state of.

24382
06:38:27,660 --> 06:38:28,760
Improvement,

24383
06:38:28,760 --> 06:38:29,480
but that from

24384
06:38:29,480 --> 06:38:30,620
knowing him better,

24385
06:38:30,620 --> 06:38:31,740
his disposition was

24386
06:38:31,740 --> 06:38:32,820
better understood.

24387
06:38:33,780 --> 06:38:34,700
Wickham's alarm

24388
06:38:34,700 --> 06:38:35,300
now appeared

24389
06:38:35,300 --> 06:38:35,820
in a heightened

24390
06:38:35,820 --> 06:38:36,380
complexion

24391
06:38:36,380 --> 06:38:37,580
and agitated look.

24392
06:38:37,860 --> 06:38:38,360
For a few.

24393
06:38:38,360 --> 06:38:38,760
Minutes.

24394
06:38:38,760 --> 06:38:39,860
He was silent

24395
06:38:39,860 --> 06:38:40,680
till shaking off

24396
06:38:40,680 --> 06:38:41,660
his embarrassment.

24397
06:38:41,660 --> 06:38:42,780
He turned to her again

24398
06:38:42,780 --> 06:38:44,100
and said in the gentlest

24399
06:38:44,100 --> 06:38:45,300
of accents.

24400
06:38:45,600 --> 06:38:47,000
You who so well know

24401
06:38:47,180 --> 06:38:48,300
feelings towards Mr.

24402
06:38:48,300 --> 06:38:48,960
Darcy,

24403
06:38:48,960 --> 06:38:50,180
will readily comprehend

24404
06:38:50,180 --> 06:38:50,900
how sincerely

24405
06:38:50,900 --> 06:38:52,020
I must rejoice

24406
06:38:52,020 --> 06:38:53,160
that he is wise enough

24407
06:38:53,160 --> 06:38:53,700
to assume

24408
06:38:53,700 --> 06:38:54,740
even the appearance

24409
06:38:54,740 --> 06:38:55,940
of what is right.

24410
06:38:56,340 --> 06:38:57,440
His pride

24411
06:38:57,440 --> 06:38:58,640
in that direction

24412
06:38:58,800 --> 06:38:59,820
may be of service,

24413
06:38:59,820 --> 06:39:00,840
if not to himself,

24414
06:39:00,840 --> 06:39:01,820
to many others,

24415
06:39:01,820 --> 06:39:03,060
for it must deter him

24416
06:39:03,060 --> 06:39:03,540
from such

24417
06:39:03,540 --> 06:39:04,680
foul misconduct

24418
06:39:04,680 --> 06:39:05,880
as I have suffered by.

24419
06:39:06,980 --> 06:39:07,820
I only fear that

24420
06:39:07,820 --> 06:39:09,060
the sort of cautiousness

24421
06:39:09,060 --> 06:39:10,260
to which you, I imagine,

24422
06:39:10,380 --> 06:39:11,580
have been eluding

24423
06:39:11,880 --> 06:39:12,900
is merely adopted

24424
06:39:12,900 --> 06:39:13,500
on his visits

24425
06:39:13,500 --> 06:39:14,700
to his aunt,

24426
06:39:14,720 --> 06:39:15,720
of whose good opinion

24427
06:39:15,720 --> 06:39:16,380
and judgment

24428
06:39:16,380 --> 06:39:17,580
stands much in awe.

24429
06:39:18,840 --> 06:39:19,500
His fear of

24430
06:39:19,500 --> 06:39:20,700
her has always operated.

24431
06:39:20,700 --> 06:39:21,420
I know when

24432
06:39:21,420 --> 06:39:22,620
they were together

24433
06:39:23,520 --> 06:39:24,300
and a good deal

24434
06:39:24,300 --> 06:39:25,140
is to be imputed

24435
06:39:25,140 --> 06:39:25,800
to his wish of

24436
06:39:25,800 --> 06:39:26,640
forwarding the match

24437
06:39:26,640 --> 06:39:27,840
with Mr. Borg,

24438
06:39:28,760 --> 06:39:29,520
which I am certain

24439
06:39:29,520 --> 06:39:30,020
he has very

24440
06:39:30,020 --> 06:39:31,220
much at heart.

24441
06:39:32,120 --> 06:39:32,820
Elizabeth could

24442
06:39:32,820 --> 06:39:33,360
not repress

24443
06:39:33,360 --> 06:39:34,560
a smile at this,

24444
06:39:34,560 --> 06:39:35,340
but she answered.

24445
06:39:35,340 --> 06:39:36,200
Only by a

24446
06:39:36,200 --> 06:39:37,400
inclination of the head.

24447
06:39:37,820 --> 06:39:38,880
She saw that he wanted

24448
06:39:38,880 --> 06:39:39,540
to engage her

24449
06:39:39,540 --> 06:39:40,520
on the old subject

24450
06:39:40,520 --> 06:39:41,720
of his grievances,

24451
06:39:41,720 --> 06:39:42,980
and she was in no humor

24452
06:39:42,980 --> 06:39:44,160
to indulge him.

24453
06:39:44,160 --> 06:39:45,200
The rest of the evening

24454
06:39:45,200 --> 06:39:46,580
passed the appearance

24455
06:39:46,580 --> 06:39:47,480
on his side

24456
06:39:47,480 --> 06:39:48,680
of usual cheerfulness,

24457
06:39:48,960 --> 06:39:49,320
but with

24458
06:39:49,320 --> 06:39:50,220
no further attempt

24459
06:39:50,220 --> 06:39:50,820
to distinguish

24460
06:39:50,820 --> 06:39:51,660
Elizabeth.

24461
06:39:51,660 --> 06:39:52,940
And they parted at last

24462
06:39:52,940 --> 06:39:54,140
with mutual civility.

24463
06:39:54,320 --> 06:39:54,620
And.

24464
06:39:54,620 --> 06:39:56,400
Possibly mutual desire

24465
06:39:56,420 --> 06:39:57,660
of never meeting again.

24466
06:39:58,560 --> 06:39:59,760
When the party broke up,

24467
06:39:59,780 --> 06:40:00,980
Lydia returned with Mrs.

24468
06:40:00,980 --> 06:40:02,180
Forrester to Maritain.

24469
06:40:02,240 --> 06:40:02,760
From whence

24470
06:40:02,760 --> 06:40:03,080
they were to

24471
06:40:03,080 --> 06:40:03,860
set out early

24472
06:40:03,860 --> 06:40:04,980
the next morning.

24473
06:40:04,980 --> 06:40:05,760
The separation

24474
06:40:05,760 --> 06:40:06,260
between her

24475
06:40:06,260 --> 06:40:06,860
and her family

24476
06:40:06,860 --> 06:40:07,740
was rather noisy

24477
06:40:07,740 --> 06:40:08,880
than pathetic.

24478
06:40:08,880 --> 06:40:09,800
Kitty was the only

24479
06:40:09,800 --> 06:40:11,000
one who shed tears.

24480
06:40:11,240 --> 06:40:11,900
But she did.

24481
06:40:11,900 --> 06:40:13,080
Weep from vexation

24482
06:40:13,080 --> 06:40:14,100
and envy.

24483
06:40:14,100 --> 06:40:14,480
Mrs.

24484
06:40:14,480 --> 06:40:15,420
Bennett was diffused

24485
06:40:15,420 --> 06:40:16,160
in her good wishes

24486
06:40:16,160 --> 06:40:16,880
for the Felicity

24487
06:40:16,880 --> 06:40:17,700
of her daughter

24488
06:40:17,700 --> 06:40:18,440
and impressive

24489
06:40:18,440 --> 06:40:19,220
in her injunctions

24490
06:40:19,220 --> 06:40:19,880
that she should not

24491
06:40:19,880 --> 06:40:20,840
miss the opportunity

24492
06:40:20,840 --> 06:40:21,840
of enjoying herself

24493
06:40:21,840 --> 06:40:23,040
as much as possible.

24494
06:40:23,180 --> 06:40:23,720
Advice

24495
06:40:23,720 --> 06:40:24,380
which there was

24496
06:40:24,380 --> 06:40:25,100
reason to believe

24497
06:40:25,100 --> 06:40:25,320
would be

24498
06:40:25,320 --> 06:40:26,520
well attended to

24499
06:40:26,640 --> 06:40:27,020
and in the

24500
06:40:27,020 --> 06:40:28,040
clamorous happiness

24501
06:40:28,040 --> 06:40:28,880
of Lydia herself

24502
06:40:28,880 --> 06:40:30,020
in bidding farewell.

24503
06:40:30,020 --> 06:40:31,160
The more gentle ideas

24504
06:40:31,160 --> 06:40:31,860
of her sisters

24505
06:40:31,860 --> 06:40:32,340
were uttered

24506
06:40:32,340 --> 06:40:33,540
without being heard.

24507
06:40:36,060 --> 06:40:37,260
Chapter 42.

24508
06:40:38,760 --> 06:40:39,920
Had Elizabeth's opinion

24509
06:40:39,920 --> 06:40:40,760
been all drawn

24510
06:40:40,760 --> 06:40:41,960
from her own family?

24511
06:40:42,000 --> 06:40:42,560
She could not

24512
06:40:42,560 --> 06:40:42,920
have formed

24513
06:40:42,920 --> 06:40:43,640
a very pleasing

24514
06:40:43,640 --> 06:40:44,600
opinion of conjugal

24515
06:40:44,600 --> 06:40:45,380
felicity or

24516
06:40:45,380 --> 06:40:46,580
domestic comfort.

24517
06:40:46,940 --> 06:40:48,300
Her father captivated

24518
06:40:48,300 --> 06:40:49,500
by youth and beauty

24519
06:40:49,560 --> 06:40:50,640
and that appearance

24520
06:40:50,640 --> 06:40:51,300
of good humor,

24521
06:40:51,300 --> 06:40:51,720
which youth

24522
06:40:51,720 --> 06:40:52,140
and beauty

24523
06:40:52,140 --> 06:40:53,220
generally give,

24524
06:40:53,220 --> 06:40:54,180
had married a woman

24525
06:40:54,180 --> 06:40:55,460
whose weak understanding

24526
06:40:55,460 --> 06:40:56,580
and a liberal mind

24527
06:40:56,580 --> 06:40:57,260
had very early

24528
06:40:57,260 --> 06:40:57,960
in their marriage,

24529
06:40:57,960 --> 06:40:58,500
put an end

24530
06:40:58,500 --> 06:40:59,580
to all real affection

24531
06:40:59,580 --> 06:41:00,440
for her.

24532
06:41:00,440 --> 06:41:01,820
Respect, esteem

24533
06:41:01,820 --> 06:41:02,660
and confidence

24534
06:41:02,660 --> 06:41:03,860
had vanished forever.

24535
06:41:04,080 --> 06:41:05,040
And all his views.

24536
06:41:05,040 --> 06:41:05,580
Of domestic

24537
06:41:05,580 --> 06:41:06,080
happiness

24538
06:41:06,080 --> 06:41:07,280
were overthrown.

24539
06:41:07,580 --> 06:41:08,220
But Mr.

24540
06:41:08,220 --> 06:41:08,880
Bennett was not

24541
06:41:08,880 --> 06:41:09,540
of a disposition

24542
06:41:09,540 --> 06:41:10,340
to seek comfort

24543
06:41:10,340 --> 06:41:11,480
for the disappointment

24544
06:41:11,480 --> 06:41:12,680
which his own imprudence

24545
06:41:12,780 --> 06:41:13,520
brought on

24546
06:41:13,520 --> 06:41:14,100
in any of

24547
06:41:14,100 --> 06:41:14,780
those pleasures,

24548
06:41:14,780 --> 06:41:16,100
which too often consoled

24549
06:41:16,100 --> 06:41:16,880
the unfortunate

24550
06:41:16,880 --> 06:41:17,700
for their folly

24551
06:41:17,700 --> 06:41:18,900
or their vice.

24552
06:41:18,980 --> 06:41:19,740
He was fond

24553
06:41:19,740 --> 06:41:20,400
of the country

24554
06:41:20,400 --> 06:41:21,420
and of books,

24555
06:41:21,420 --> 06:41:22,680
and from these tastes

24556
06:41:22,820 --> 06:41:23,180
arisen

24557
06:41:23,180 --> 06:41:23,840
his principal

24558
06:41:23,840 --> 06:41:24,980
enjoyments.

24559
06:41:24,980 --> 06:41:25,800
To his wife.

24560
06:41:25,800 --> 06:41:26,600
He was very little

24561
06:41:26,600 --> 06:41:27,800
otherwise indebted

24562
06:41:27,960 --> 06:41:29,240
then, as her ignorance

24563
06:41:29,240 --> 06:41:29,880
and folly

24564
06:41:29,880 --> 06:41:30,620
had contributed.

24565
06:41:30,620 --> 06:41:31,820
To his amusement.

24566
06:41:32,100 --> 06:41:32,780
This is not.

24567
06:41:32,780 --> 06:41:33,620
The sort of happiness

24568
06:41:33,620 --> 06:41:34,220
which a man would

24569
06:41:34,220 --> 06:41:34,680
in general

24570
06:41:34,680 --> 06:41:35,100
a wish to

24571
06:41:35,100 --> 06:41:36,300
owe to his wife,

24572
06:41:36,360 --> 06:41:36,740
but where

24573
06:41:36,740 --> 06:41:37,400
other powers

24574
06:41:37,400 --> 06:41:38,040
of entertainment

24575
06:41:38,040 --> 06:41:38,960
are wanting.

24576
06:41:38,960 --> 06:41:40,080
The true philosopher

24577
06:41:40,080 --> 06:41:41,300
will derive benefit from

24578
06:41:41,300 --> 06:41:42,560
such as are given.

24579
06:41:43,640 --> 06:41:44,640
Elizabeth, however,

24580
06:41:44,640 --> 06:41:45,060
had never

24581
06:41:45,060 --> 06:41:45,660
been blind

24582
06:41:45,660 --> 06:41:46,520
to the impropriety

24583
06:41:46,520 --> 06:41:47,120
of her father's

24584
06:41:47,120 --> 06:41:47,600
behavior.

24585
06:41:47,600 --> 06:41:48,720
As a husband.

24586
06:41:48,720 --> 06:41:49,760
She had always seen it

24587
06:41:49,760 --> 06:41:50,660
with pain.

24588
06:41:50,660 --> 06:41:51,480
But respecting

24589
06:41:51,480 --> 06:41:52,320
his abilities

24590
06:41:52,320 --> 06:41:52,980
and grateful

24591
06:41:52,980 --> 06:41:53,880
for his affectionate

24592
06:41:53,880 --> 06:41:55,080
treatment of herself.

24593
06:41:55,160 --> 06:41:56,240
She endeavored to forget

24594
06:41:56,240 --> 06:41:56,640
what she could

24595
06:41:56,640 --> 06:41:57,660
not overlook

24596
06:41:57,660 --> 06:41:58,340
and to banish

24597
06:41:58,340 --> 06:41:58,980
from her thoughts

24598
06:41:58,980 --> 06:42:00,000
that continual breach

24599
06:42:00,000 --> 06:42:01,200
of conjugal obligation

24600
06:42:01,200 --> 06:42:02,220
and decorum.

24601
06:42:02,220 --> 06:42:02,780
Which, in.

24602
06:42:02,780 --> 06:42:03,720
Exposing his wife

24603
06:42:03,720 --> 06:42:04,340
to the contempt

24604
06:42:04,340 --> 06:42:04,740
of her own

24605
06:42:04,740 --> 06:42:05,520
children,

24606
06:42:05,520 --> 06:42:05,900
was so

24607
06:42:05,900 --> 06:42:07,140
highly reprehensible.

24608
06:42:07,680 --> 06:42:08,360
But she had never.

24609
06:42:08,360 --> 06:42:09,300
Felt so strongly

24610
06:42:09,300 --> 06:42:10,700
as now the disadvantages

24611
06:42:10,880 --> 06:42:11,820
which must attend

24612
06:42:11,820 --> 06:42:12,320
the children

24613
06:42:12,320 --> 06:42:13,280
of so unsuitable

24614
06:42:13,280 --> 06:42:13,980
a marriage,

24615
06:42:13,980 --> 06:42:14,600
nor ever been

24616
06:42:14,600 --> 06:42:15,380
so fully aware

24617
06:42:15,380 --> 06:42:16,040
of the evils

24618
06:42:16,040 --> 06:42:16,740
arising from

24619
06:42:16,740 --> 06:42:17,640
so ill judged

24620
06:42:17,640 --> 06:42:18,140
a direction

24621
06:42:18,140 --> 06:42:19,880
of talents, talents

24622
06:42:19,880 --> 06:42:21,420
which rightly used

24623
06:42:21,620 --> 06:42:22,140
might at

24624
06:42:22,140 --> 06:42:23,160
least have preserved

24625
06:42:23,160 --> 06:42:24,060
the respectability

24626
06:42:24,060 --> 06:42:25,080
of his daughters.

24627
06:42:25,080 --> 06:42:25,460
Even.

24628
06:42:25,460 --> 06:42:26,240
If incapable

24629
06:42:26,240 --> 06:42:27,480
of enlarging the mind of

24630
06:42:27,480 --> 06:42:28,020
his wife.

24631
06:42:29,000 --> 06:42:29,700
When Elizabeth

24632
06:42:29,700 --> 06:42:30,320
had rejoiced

24633
06:42:30,320 --> 06:42:31,520
over Wickens departure,

24634
06:42:31,680 --> 06:42:32,240
she found

24635
06:42:32,240 --> 06:42:33,060
little other cause

24636
06:42:33,060 --> 06:42:33,920
for satisfaction

24637
06:42:33,920 --> 06:42:34,140
and the

24638
06:42:34,140 --> 06:42:35,340
loss of the regiment.

24639
06:42:35,660 --> 06:42:36,780
Their parties abroad

24640
06:42:36,780 --> 06:42:37,200
were less

24641
06:42:37,200 --> 06:42:38,400
varied than before.

24642
06:42:38,600 --> 06:42:39,260
And at home

24643
06:42:39,260 --> 06:42:39,960
she had a mother

24644
06:42:39,960 --> 06:42:40,520
and sister

24645
06:42:40,520 --> 06:42:41,720
whose constantly

24646
06:42:41,840 --> 06:42:42,480
at the dullness

24647
06:42:42,480 --> 06:42:42,960
of everything

24648
06:42:42,960 --> 06:42:43,880
around them.

24649
06:42:43,880 --> 06:42:44,160
Threw a.

24650
06:42:44,160 --> 06:42:44,960
Real gloom

24651
06:42:44,960 --> 06:42:45,320
over their

24652
06:42:45,320 --> 06:42:46,520
domestic circle.

24653
06:42:46,820 --> 06:42:47,280
And though

24654
06:42:47,280 --> 06:42:48,380
Kitty might in time

24655
06:42:48,380 --> 06:42:48,800
regain her

24656
06:42:48,800 --> 06:42:50,100
natural degree of sense,

24657
06:42:50,400 --> 06:42:51,540
since the disturbance

24658
06:42:51,540 --> 06:42:52,740
her brain were removed,

24659
06:42:52,980 --> 06:42:54,080
her other sister

24660
06:42:54,080 --> 06:42:54,500
from whose

24661
06:42:54,500 --> 06:42:55,800
disposition greater evil

24662
06:42:55,800 --> 06:42:57,000
might be apprehended,

24663
06:42:57,080 --> 06:42:57,680
was likely

24664
06:42:57,680 --> 06:42:58,400
to be hardened

24665
06:42:58,400 --> 06:42:59,400
in all her folly

24666
06:42:59,400 --> 06:43:00,260
and assurance by.

24667
06:43:00,260 --> 06:43:01,560
A situation of double.

24668
06:43:01,560 --> 06:43:02,240
Danger

24669
06:43:02,240 --> 06:43:03,440
as a watering place

24670
06:43:03,440 --> 06:43:04,640
and a. Camp.

24671
06:43:04,800 --> 06:43:05,580
Upon the whole.

24672
06:43:05,580 --> 06:43:06,660
Therefore, she.

24673
06:43:06,660 --> 06:43:07,200
Found

24674
06:43:07,200 --> 06:43:07,760
what has been

24675
06:43:07,760 --> 06:43:08,460
sometimes found

24676
06:43:08,460 --> 06:43:10,160
before that an event

24677
06:43:10,160 --> 06:43:10,560
to which

24678
06:43:10,560 --> 06:43:10,980
she had been

24679
06:43:10,980 --> 06:43:11,640
looking forward

24680
06:43:11,640 --> 06:43:12,840
with impatient desire,

24681
06:43:13,020 --> 06:43:14,760
did not in taking place,

24682
06:43:15,000 --> 06:43:15,560
bring all the

24683
06:43:15,560 --> 06:43:16,320
satisfaction

24684
06:43:16,320 --> 06:43:16,620
she had

24685
06:43:16,620 --> 06:43:17,820
promised herself.

24686
06:43:17,960 --> 06:43:19,080
It was consequently

24687
06:43:19,080 --> 06:43:19,680
necessary

24688
06:43:19,680 --> 06:43:20,880
to name some other

24689
06:43:20,960 --> 06:43:21,740
for the commencement

24690
06:43:21,740 --> 06:43:22,940
of actual Felicity

24691
06:43:23,300 --> 06:43:24,480
to have some other point

24692
06:43:24,480 --> 06:43:25,260
on which her wishes

24693
06:43:25,260 --> 06:43:25,740
and hopes

24694
06:43:25,740 --> 06:43:26,900
might be fixed,

24695
06:43:26,900 --> 06:43:28,020
and by again enjoying

24696
06:43:28,020 --> 06:43:28,440
the pleasure

24697
06:43:28,440 --> 06:43:30,120
of anticipation console

24698
06:43:30,620 --> 06:43:31,640
for the present

24699
06:43:31,640 --> 06:43:32,660
and prepare for

24700
06:43:32,660 --> 06:43:33,860
another disappointment.

24701
06:43:34,520 --> 06:43:35,720
Her tour to the Lakes

24702
06:43:35,720 --> 06:43:36,060
was now

24703
06:43:36,060 --> 06:43:36,920
the object of her

24704
06:43:36,920 --> 06:43:38,120
happiest thoughts.

24705
06:43:38,120 --> 06:43:38,540
It was

24706
06:43:38,540 --> 06:43:39,860
the best consolation

24707
06:43:40,020 --> 06:43:40,380
all the

24708
06:43:40,380 --> 06:43:41,420
uncomfortable hours

24709
06:43:41,420 --> 06:43:42,380
which the discontented

24710
06:43:42,380 --> 06:43:43,140
ness of her mother

24711
06:43:43,140 --> 06:43:43,620
and Kitty

24712
06:43:43,620 --> 06:43:44,820
made inevitable.

24713
06:43:44,820 --> 06:43:45,440
And could she

24714
06:43:45,440 --> 06:43:46,020
have included

24715
06:43:46,020 --> 06:43:47,220
Jane in the scheme?

24716
06:43:47,240 --> 06:43:48,180
Every part of it

24717
06:43:48,180 --> 06:43:49,380
would have been perfect.

24718
06:43:50,040 --> 06:43:51,300
But it is fortunate,

24719
06:43:51,620 --> 06:43:52,680
thought she,

24720
06:43:52,680 --> 06:43:53,580
that I have something

24721
06:43:53,580 --> 06:43:54,960
to wish for where

24722
06:43:54,960 --> 06:43:55,860
the whole arrangement

24723
06:43:55,860 --> 06:43:56,580
complete

24724
06:43:56,580 --> 06:43:57,620
my disappointment

24725
06:43:57,620 --> 06:43:58,820
would be certain.

24726
06:43:58,940 --> 06:44:01,080
But by carrying with me

24727
06:44:01,080 --> 06:44:02,340
one ceaseless source

24728
06:44:02,340 --> 06:44:02,940
of regret in.

24729
06:44:02,940 --> 06:44:04,140
My sister's absence.

24730
06:44:04,440 --> 06:44:05,520
I may reasonably hope

24731
06:44:05,520 --> 06:44:05,780
to have

24732
06:44:05,780 --> 06:44:06,920
all my expectations

24733
06:44:06,920 --> 06:44:08,120
of pleasure realized.

24734
06:44:08,640 --> 06:44:09,360
A scheme

24735
06:44:09,360 --> 06:44:10,020
which every

24736
06:44:10,020 --> 06:44:11,340
part promises delight

24737
06:44:11,340 --> 06:44:12,560
can never be successful

24738
06:44:12,900 --> 06:44:13,500
and general

24739
06:44:13,500 --> 06:44:14,180
disappointment

24740
06:44:14,180 --> 06:44:15,060
is only warded.

24741
06:44:15,060 --> 06:44:16,020
Off by the defense

24742
06:44:16,020 --> 06:44:16,640
of some little

24743
06:44:16,640 --> 06:44:18,020
peculiar vexation.

24744
06:44:19,200 --> 06:44:19,740
When Lydia

24745
06:44:19,740 --> 06:44:20,460
went away, she

24746
06:44:20,460 --> 06:44:20,960
promised to

24747
06:44:20,960 --> 06:44:22,020
write very often

24748
06:44:22,020 --> 06:44:22,880
and very minutely

24749
06:44:22,880 --> 06:44:24,080
to her mother and Kitty.

24750
06:44:24,260 --> 06:44:25,020
But her letters

24751
06:44:25,020 --> 06:44:25,460
were always

24752
06:44:25,460 --> 06:44:26,420
long expected

24753
06:44:26,420 --> 06:44:27,860
and always very short.

24754
06:44:28,340 --> 06:44:29,280
Those To her, mother

24755
06:44:29,280 --> 06:44:30,240
contained little else

24756
06:44:30,240 --> 06:44:30,540
than that.

24757
06:44:30,540 --> 06:44:31,340
They were just returned

24758
06:44:31,340 --> 06:44:32,340
from the library

24759
06:44:32,340 --> 06:44:32,720
where such

24760
06:44:32,720 --> 06:44:33,600
and such officers

24761
06:44:33,600 --> 06:44:34,460
had attended them,

24762
06:44:34,460 --> 06:44:35,100
and where she had

24763
06:44:35,100 --> 06:44:35,760
seen such

24764
06:44:35,760 --> 06:44:36,560
beautiful ornaments

24765
06:44:36,560 --> 06:44:37,820
as made her quite wild.

24766
06:44:38,180 --> 06:44:38,400
That.

24767
06:44:38,400 --> 06:44:39,380
She a new gown

24768
06:44:39,380 --> 06:44:40,800
or a new parasol, which

24769
06:44:40,800 --> 06:44:41,480
she would have described

24770
06:44:41,480 --> 06:44:42,140
more fully,

24771
06:44:42,140 --> 06:44:42,840
but was obliged

24772
06:44:42,840 --> 06:44:43,260
to leave off

24773
06:44:43,260 --> 06:44:44,460
in a violent hurry,

24774
06:44:44,480 --> 06:44:45,000
as Mrs.

24775
06:44:45,000 --> 06:44:45,860
Foster called her,

24776
06:44:45,860 --> 06:44:46,160
and they were

24777
06:44:46,160 --> 06:44:47,360
going off to the camp

24778
06:44:47,480 --> 06:44:47,880
and from

24779
06:44:47,880 --> 06:44:48,600
her correspondent

24780
06:44:48,600 --> 06:44:49,520
with her sister,

24781
06:44:49,520 --> 06:44:50,360
there was still less

24782
06:44:50,360 --> 06:44:51,180
to be learned.

24783
06:44:51,180 --> 06:44:51,500
For her.

24784
06:44:51,500 --> 06:44:52,780
Letters to Kitty, though

24785
06:44:52,780 --> 06:44:54,200
rather longer, were much

24786
06:44:54,200 --> 06:44:55,040
too full of lines

24787
06:44:55,040 --> 06:44:55,320
under the

24788
06:44:55,320 --> 06:44:56,840
words to be made public.

24789
06:44:57,840 --> 06:44:58,160
After.

24790
06:44:58,160 --> 06:44:59,480
The first or three

24791
06:44:59,480 --> 06:45:00,680
weeks of her absence.

24792
06:45:00,740 --> 06:45:01,200
Health.

24793
06:45:01,200 --> 06:45:01,860
Good humor

24794
06:45:01,860 --> 06:45:02,700
and cheerfulness

24795
06:45:02,700 --> 06:45:03,720
began to reappear

24796
06:45:03,720 --> 06:45:04,760
at long born.

24797
06:45:04,760 --> 06:45:05,580
Everything more

24798
06:45:05,580 --> 06:45:06,780
a happier aspect.

24799
06:45:06,960 --> 06:45:07,700
The families

24800
06:45:07,700 --> 06:45:08,480
who had been in town,

24801
06:45:08,480 --> 06:45:08,880
the winter

24802
06:45:08,880 --> 06:45:09,840
came back again

24803
06:45:09,840 --> 06:45:10,820
and summer finery

24804
06:45:10,820 --> 06:45:11,220
in summer

24805
06:45:11,220 --> 06:45:12,420
engagements arose.

24806
06:45:12,740 --> 06:45:13,160
Mrs.

24807
06:45:13,160 --> 06:45:14,000
Bennett was restored

24808
06:45:14,000 --> 06:45:14,180
to her

24809
06:45:14,180 --> 06:45:14,580
usual

24810
06:45:14,580 --> 06:45:15,780
querulous serenity,

24811
06:45:15,980 --> 06:45:16,400
and by the

24812
06:45:16,400 --> 06:45:17,400
middle of June.

24813
06:45:17,400 --> 06:45:18,300
Kitty was so much.

24814
06:45:18,300 --> 06:45:19,220
Recovered as to be able

24815
06:45:19,220 --> 06:45:19,620
to enter

24816
06:45:19,620 --> 06:45:20,900
Maritain without tears.

24817
06:45:21,180 --> 06:45:22,340
An event of such happy

24818
06:45:22,340 --> 06:45:23,040
promise

24819
06:45:23,040 --> 06:45:23,540
as to make

24820
06:45:23,540 --> 06:45:24,200
Elizabeth hope

24821
06:45:24,200 --> 06:45:24,480
that by

24822
06:45:24,480 --> 06:45:25,680
the following Christmas

24823
06:45:25,740 --> 06:45:26,240
she might be

24824
06:45:26,240 --> 06:45:27,440
so tolerably reasonable

24825
06:45:27,440 --> 06:45:28,340
as to not mention

24826
06:45:28,340 --> 06:45:29,000
officer above

24827
06:45:29,000 --> 06:45:30,000
once a day.

24828
06:45:30,000 --> 06:45:31,260
Alas, by some cruel

24829
06:45:31,260 --> 06:45:31,700
and malicious

24830
06:45:31,700 --> 06:45:32,120
arrangement

24831
06:45:32,120 --> 06:45:33,140
at the War Office,

24832
06:45:33,140 --> 06:45:33,980
another regiment

24833
06:45:33,980 --> 06:45:34,740
should be quartered

24834
06:45:34,740 --> 06:45:35,940
in Britain.

24835
06:45:36,260 --> 06:45:37,220
The time fixed

24836
06:45:37,220 --> 06:45:37,460
for the

24837
06:45:37,460 --> 06:45:38,760
beginning of their tour

24838
06:45:38,760 --> 06:45:39,380
was now fast

24839
06:45:39,380 --> 06:45:40,160
approaching.

24840
06:45:40,160 --> 06:45:40,980
And a fortnight

24841
06:45:40,980 --> 06:45:41,420
only was.

24842
06:45:41,420 --> 06:45:42,360
Wanting of it.

24843
06:45:42,360 --> 06:45:43,340
When a letter arrived

24844
06:45:43,340 --> 06:45:43,700
from Mrs.

24845
06:45:43,700 --> 06:45:44,360
Gardiner,

24846
06:45:44,360 --> 06:45:45,480
which had once delayed

24847
06:45:45,480 --> 06:45:46,200
its commencement

24848
06:45:46,200 --> 06:45:47,000
and curtailed

24849
06:45:47,000 --> 06:45:48,600
its extent, Mr.

24850
06:45:48,600 --> 06:45:49,200
Gardiner would

24851
06:45:49,200 --> 06:45:50,360
be prevented by business

24852
06:45:50,360 --> 06:45:51,060
from setting out

24853
06:45:51,060 --> 06:45:52,160
until a fortnight later

24854
06:45:52,160 --> 06:45:53,000
in July

24855
06:45:53,000 --> 06:45:53,720
and must be in

24856
06:45:53,720 --> 06:45:54,380
London again

24857
06:45:54,380 --> 06:45:55,380
within a month.

24858
06:45:55,380 --> 06:45:56,220
And as that left

24859
06:45:56,220 --> 06:45:56,660
too short

24860
06:45:56,660 --> 06:45:57,120
a period

24861
06:45:57,120 --> 06:45:58,320
for them to so far

24862
06:45:58,440 --> 06:45:58,820
and see

24863
06:45:58,820 --> 06:45:59,340
so much

24864
06:45:59,340 --> 06:46:00,540
as they had proposed.

24865
06:46:00,540 --> 06:46:01,460
Or at least to see it.

24866
06:46:01,460 --> 06:46:01,980
With the leisure

24867
06:46:01,980 --> 06:46:02,540
and comfort

24868
06:46:02,540 --> 06:46:03,060
they had built

24869
06:46:03,060 --> 06:46:04,380
on, they were obliged

24870
06:46:04,380 --> 06:46:05,540
to give up the legs

24871
06:46:05,540 --> 06:46:06,380
and substituted

24872
06:46:06,380 --> 06:46:07,620
more contracted tour,

24873
06:46:07,880 --> 06:46:08,460
and according

24874
06:46:08,460 --> 06:46:09,600
to the present plan,

24875
06:46:09,600 --> 06:46:10,640
were to go no farther

24876
06:46:10,640 --> 06:46:11,280
northwards

24877
06:46:11,280 --> 06:46:12,480
than Derbyshire.

24878
06:46:12,660 --> 06:46:13,580
In that country

24879
06:46:13,580 --> 06:46:14,120
there was enough

24880
06:46:14,120 --> 06:46:14,640
to be seen

24881
06:46:14,640 --> 06:46:15,560
to occupy the chief

24882
06:46:15,560 --> 06:46:16,020
of their three

24883
06:46:16,020 --> 06:46:16,880
weeks and.

24884
06:46:16,880 --> 06:46:17,760
To Mrs. Gardiner.

24885
06:46:17,760 --> 06:46:18,620
It had a peculiarly

24886
06:46:18,620 --> 06:46:19,820
strong attraction

24887
06:46:20,120 --> 06:46:20,660
the town

24888
06:46:20,660 --> 06:46:21,020
where she had

24889
06:46:21,020 --> 06:46:21,860
formerly passed

24890
06:46:21,860 --> 06:46:23,060
some years of her life

24891
06:46:23,100 --> 06:46:23,480
and where

24892
06:46:23,480 --> 06:46:24,300
they were now to spend

24893
06:46:24,300 --> 06:46:25,100
a few days

24894
06:46:25,100 --> 06:46:26,160
was probably as great

24895
06:46:26,160 --> 06:46:26,780
an object.

24896
06:46:26,780 --> 06:46:27,560
Her curiosity

24897
06:46:27,560 --> 06:46:27,840
as all

24898
06:46:27,840 --> 06:46:28,860
the celebrated beauties

24899
06:46:28,860 --> 06:46:30,380
of Matlock, Chatsworth,

24900
06:46:30,560 --> 06:46:32,040
Dovedale, or the peak.

24901
06:46:32,880 --> 06:46:33,420
Elizabeth

24902
06:46:33,420 --> 06:46:34,220
was excessively

24903
06:46:34,220 --> 06:46:35,120
disappointed.

24904
06:46:35,120 --> 06:46:36,180
She had set her heart

24905
06:46:36,180 --> 06:46:37,320
on seeing lakes

24906
06:46:37,320 --> 06:46:38,100
and still thought

24907
06:46:38,100 --> 06:46:38,580
there might have

24908
06:46:38,580 --> 06:46:39,780
been time enough.

24909
06:46:39,900 --> 06:46:40,920
But it was her business

24910
06:46:40,920 --> 06:46:42,200
to be satisfied and

24911
06:46:42,200 --> 06:46:42,780
certainly her

24912
06:46:42,780 --> 06:46:43,980
temper to be happy

24913
06:46:44,000 --> 06:46:44,900
and all was soon

24914
06:46:44,900 --> 06:46:46,100
right again

24915
06:46:46,380 --> 06:46:47,000
with the mention

24916
06:46:47,000 --> 06:46:47,720
of Derbyshire.

24917
06:46:47,720 --> 06:46:48,140
There were many

24918
06:46:48,140 --> 06:46:49,340
ideas connected.

24919
06:46:49,400 --> 06:46:50,360
It was impossible.

24920
06:46:50,360 --> 06:46:51,260
For her to see the word

24921
06:46:51,260 --> 06:46:51,840
without thinking

24922
06:46:51,840 --> 06:46:52,520
of Pemberley

24923
06:46:52,520 --> 06:46:53,720
and its owner.

24924
06:46:53,940 --> 06:46:55,760
But surely, said she,

24925
06:46:55,980 --> 06:46:57,480
I may enter his county

24926
06:46:57,480 --> 06:46:57,800
without.

24927
06:46:57,800 --> 06:46:59,300
Impunity and rob it

24928
06:46:59,300 --> 06:47:00,900
of a few petrified spies

24929
06:47:00,900 --> 06:47:01,380
without his

24930
06:47:01,380 --> 06:47:02,180
perceiving me.

24931
06:47:03,180 --> 06:47:03,800
The period of

24932
06:47:03,800 --> 06:47:04,820
expectation was

24933
06:47:04,820 --> 06:47:05,780
now doubled.

24934
06:47:05,780 --> 06:47:06,440
Four weeks

24935
06:47:06,440 --> 06:47:07,160
were to pass away

24936
06:47:07,160 --> 06:47:07,560
before her

24937
06:47:07,560 --> 06:47:08,000
uncle and

24938
06:47:08,000 --> 06:47:09,140
aunt's arrival.

24939
06:47:09,140 --> 06:47:10,380
But they did pass away.

24940
06:47:10,620 --> 06:47:11,220
And Mr.

24941
06:47:11,220 --> 06:47:11,600
and Mrs.

24942
06:47:11,600 --> 06:47:12,140
Gardner,

24943
06:47:12,140 --> 06:47:12,500
with their

24944
06:47:12,500 --> 06:47:13,440
four children,

24945
06:47:13,440 --> 06:47:14,460
did at length appear

24946
06:47:14,460 --> 06:47:15,560
at Long Bourn.

24947
06:47:15,560 --> 06:47:16,380
The children,

24948
06:47:16,380 --> 06:47:17,540
two girls of six

24949
06:47:17,540 --> 06:47:18,560
and eight years old

24950
06:47:18,560 --> 06:47:19,760
and two younger boys,

24951
06:47:19,940 --> 06:47:20,600
were to be left

24952
06:47:20,600 --> 06:47:21,300
out of the particular

24953
06:47:21,300 --> 06:47:22,040
care of their cousin

24954
06:47:22,040 --> 06:47:22,700
Jane,

24955
06:47:22,700 --> 06:47:23,060
who was the

24956
06:47:23,060 --> 06:47:24,180
general favorite

24957
06:47:24,180 --> 06:47:25,400
and whose steady sense

24958
06:47:25,400 --> 06:47:25,980
and sweetness

24959
06:47:25,980 --> 06:47:26,420
of temper

24960
06:47:26,420 --> 06:47:27,620
exactly adapted her

24961
06:47:27,620 --> 06:47:28,500
for attending to them

24962
06:47:28,500 --> 06:47:29,520
in every way,

24963
06:47:29,520 --> 06:47:30,320
teaching them,

24964
06:47:30,320 --> 06:47:31,340
playing with them

24965
06:47:31,340 --> 06:47:32,540
and loving them.

24966
06:47:33,120 --> 06:47:34,080
The gardener stayed

24967
06:47:34,080 --> 06:47:34,880
only one night

24968
06:47:34,880 --> 06:47:35,660
at Long Bourn

24969
06:47:35,660 --> 06:47:36,300
and set off

24970
06:47:36,300 --> 06:47:36,980
the next morning

24971
06:47:36,980 --> 06:47:37,580
with Elizabeth

24972
06:47:37,580 --> 06:47:38,060
in pursuit

24973
06:47:38,060 --> 06:47:38,660
of novelty

24974
06:47:38,660 --> 06:47:39,860
and amusement.

24975
06:47:39,860 --> 06:47:40,800
One enjoyment was.

24976
06:47:40,800 --> 06:47:42,300
Certain that of suitable

24977
06:47:42,300 --> 06:47:43,500
nursing companions.

24978
06:47:43,620 --> 06:47:44,360
A suitable nest

24979
06:47:44,360 --> 06:47:45,120
which comprehended

24980
06:47:45,120 --> 06:47:45,920
health and temper

24981
06:47:45,920 --> 06:47:46,340
to bear barren

24982
06:47:46,340 --> 06:47:47,400
conveniences,

24983
06:47:47,400 --> 06:47:48,440
cheerfulness to enhance

24984
06:47:48,440 --> 06:47:49,260
every pleasure

24985
06:47:49,260 --> 06:47:50,000
and affection

24986
06:47:50,000 --> 06:47:51,060
and intelligence.

24987
06:47:51,060 --> 06:47:51,500
Which might.

24988
06:47:51,500 --> 06:47:52,020
Supply it

24989
06:47:52,020 --> 06:47:52,880
among themselves

24990
06:47:52,880 --> 06:47:53,240
if there were

24991
06:47:53,240 --> 06:47:54,540
disappointments abroad.

24992
06:47:55,220 --> 06:47:56,460
It is not the object.

24993
06:47:56,460 --> 06:47:57,000
Of this work

24994
06:47:57,000 --> 06:47:57,740
to give a description

24995
06:47:57,740 --> 06:47:58,800
of Derbyshire,

24996
06:47:58,800 --> 06:47:59,700
nor of any of the

24997
06:47:59,700 --> 06:48:00,780
remarkable places

24998
06:48:00,780 --> 06:48:01,740
through which their root

24999
06:48:01,740 --> 06:48:02,640
thither lay.

25000
06:48:02,640 --> 06:48:03,360
Oxford.

25001
06:48:03,360 --> 06:48:03,980
Blenheim.

25002
06:48:03,980 --> 06:48:05,240
Warwick Kenilworth,

25003
06:48:05,360 --> 06:48:06,480
Birmingham, etc.

25004
06:48:06,480 --> 06:48:07,680
are sufficiently known.

25005
06:48:07,980 --> 06:48:08,780
A small part

25006
06:48:08,780 --> 06:48:09,420
of Derbyshire

25007
06:48:09,420 --> 06:48:09,960
is all the

25008
06:48:09,960 --> 06:48:11,160
present concern

25009
06:48:11,220 --> 06:48:11,960
to the little town

25010
06:48:11,960 --> 06:48:12,740
of Lampton.

25011
06:48:12,740 --> 06:48:13,520
The scene of Mrs.

25012
06:48:13,520 --> 06:48:14,720
Gardner's former

25013
06:48:14,960 --> 06:48:15,720
and where she had

25014
06:48:15,720 --> 06:48:16,280
lately learned

25015
06:48:16,280 --> 06:48:17,100
some acquaintance

25016
06:48:17,100 --> 06:48:18,060
still remained.

25017
06:48:18,060 --> 06:48:19,260
They bent their steps

25018
06:48:19,400 --> 06:48:20,340
after having seen

25019
06:48:20,340 --> 06:48:20,580
all the

25020
06:48:20,580 --> 06:48:21,380
principal wonders

25021
06:48:21,380 --> 06:48:22,380
of the country.

25022
06:48:22,380 --> 06:48:22,860
And within.

25023
06:48:22,860 --> 06:48:24,080
Five miles of Lambton

25024
06:48:24,360 --> 06:48:24,840
Elizabeth

25025
06:48:24,840 --> 06:48:25,760
found from her aunt

25026
06:48:25,760 --> 06:48:26,480
that Pemberley

25027
06:48:26,480 --> 06:48:27,620
was situated.

25028
06:48:27,620 --> 06:48:28,280
It was not in

25029
06:48:28,280 --> 06:48:29,600
their direct road, nor

25030
06:48:29,600 --> 06:48:30,300
more than a mile

25031
06:48:30,300 --> 06:48:31,440
or two out of it.

25032
06:48:31,440 --> 06:48:32,400
In talking over their

25033
06:48:32,400 --> 06:48:32,780
roots the.

25034
06:48:32,780 --> 06:48:34,220
Evening before, Mrs..

25035
06:48:34,220 --> 06:48:35,160
Gardner expressed

25036
06:48:35,160 --> 06:48:35,820
an inclination

25037
06:48:35,820 --> 06:48:37,020
to see the place again.

25038
06:48:37,320 --> 06:48:37,680
Mr.

25039
06:48:37,680 --> 06:48:38,000
Gardner

25040
06:48:38,000 --> 06:48:38,340
declared

25041
06:48:38,340 --> 06:48:39,300
his willingness.

25042
06:48:39,300 --> 06:48:39,540
And.

25043
06:48:39,540 --> 06:48:40,700
Elizabeth was applied to

25044
06:48:40,700 --> 06:48:41,900
for her approbation.

25045
06:48:42,600 --> 06:48:43,640
My love

25046
06:48:43,640 --> 06:48:44,060
should not

25047
06:48:44,060 --> 06:48:45,000
you like to see of place

25048
06:48:45,000 --> 06:48:45,560
of which you've heard

25049
06:48:45,560 --> 06:48:46,580
so much.

25050
06:48:46,580 --> 06:48:47,760
Said her aunt.

25051
06:48:47,760 --> 06:48:48,500
A place too,

25052
06:48:48,500 --> 06:48:48,840
with which

25053
06:48:48,840 --> 06:48:49,320
so many of your

25054
06:48:49,320 --> 06:48:50,000
acquaintances

25055
06:48:50,000 --> 06:48:51,000
are connected.

25056
06:48:51,000 --> 06:48:51,860
Wickham passed

25057
06:48:51,860 --> 06:48:52,580
or his You fail,

25058
06:48:52,580 --> 06:48:53,780
you know.

25059
06:48:53,880 --> 06:48:54,660
Elizabeth was

25060
06:48:54,660 --> 06:48:55,580
distressed.

25061
06:48:55,580 --> 06:48:56,240
She felt that

25062
06:48:56,240 --> 06:48:57,180
she had no business

25063
06:48:57,180 --> 06:48:57,960
at Pemberley

25064
06:48:57,960 --> 06:48:58,700
and was obliged

25065
06:48:58,700 --> 06:48:59,100
to assume

25066
06:48:59,100 --> 06:48:59,940
a disinclination

25067
06:48:59,940 --> 06:49:00,980
for seeing it.

25068
06:49:00,980 --> 06:49:01,800
She must own that.

25069
06:49:01,800 --> 06:49:02,420
She was tired

25070
06:49:02,420 --> 06:49:03,620
of seeing great houses.

25071
06:49:03,720 --> 06:49:04,280
After going

25072
06:49:04,280 --> 06:49:05,120
over so many,

25073
06:49:05,120 --> 06:49:05,700
she really had

25074
06:49:05,700 --> 06:49:06,200
no pleasure

25075
06:49:06,200 --> 06:49:07,620
in fine carpets or satin

25076
06:49:07,620 --> 06:49:08,820
curtains.

25077
06:49:08,840 --> 06:49:09,200
Mrs.

25078
06:49:09,200 --> 06:49:09,560
Gardiner

25079
06:49:09,560 --> 06:49:10,820
abused her stupidity.

25080
06:49:11,420 --> 06:49:11,880
If it were.

25081
06:49:11,880 --> 06:49:12,960
Merely a fine house.

25082
06:49:12,960 --> 06:49:14,100
Richly furnished,

25083
06:49:14,100 --> 06:49:15,000
said she.

25084
06:49:15,000 --> 06:49:15,560
I should not

25085
06:49:15,560 --> 06:49:16,760
care about it myself.

25086
06:49:16,920 --> 06:49:17,760
But the grounds

25087
06:49:17,760 --> 06:49:18,900
are delightful.

25088
06:49:18,900 --> 06:49:19,520
They have some of the

25089
06:49:19,520 --> 06:49:20,100
finest.

25090
06:49:20,100 --> 06:49:21,200
Woods in the country.

25091
06:49:22,200 --> 06:49:23,520
Elizabeth Said no more.

25092
06:49:23,760 --> 06:49:24,680
But her mind could

25093
06:49:24,680 --> 06:49:25,880
not acquiesce.

25094
06:49:26,060 --> 06:49:26,880
The possibility

25095
06:49:26,880 --> 06:49:27,500
of meeting. Mr.

25096
06:49:27,500 --> 06:49:27,980
Darcy

25097
06:49:27,980 --> 06:49:28,880
while viewing the place

25098
06:49:28,880 --> 06:49:30,080
instantly occurred.

25099
06:49:30,140 --> 06:49:31,340
It would be dreadful.

25100
06:49:31,620 --> 06:49:32,820
She blushed at the very

25101
06:49:33,380 --> 06:49:34,140
and thought it would be

25102
06:49:34,140 --> 06:49:34,760
better to speak

25103
06:49:34,760 --> 06:49:35,480
openly to her

25104
06:49:35,480 --> 06:49:36,300
aunt than to run

25105
06:49:36,300 --> 06:49:37,500
such a risk.

25106
06:49:37,520 --> 06:49:38,520
But against this

25107
06:49:38,520 --> 06:49:39,680
there were objections

25108
06:49:39,680 --> 06:49:40,400
and she finally

25109
06:49:40,400 --> 06:49:40,880
resolved that

25110
06:49:40,880 --> 06:49:41,180
it could be

25111
06:49:41,180 --> 06:49:42,140
the last resource

25112
06:49:42,140 --> 06:49:43,280
if her inquiries

25113
06:49:43,280 --> 06:49:44,000
to the absence of

25114
06:49:44,000 --> 06:49:44,520
the family

25115
06:49:44,520 --> 06:49:45,320
were unfavorably

25116
06:49:45,320 --> 06:49:46,520
answered.

25117
06:49:46,560 --> 06:49:47,220
Accordingly,

25118
06:49:47,220 --> 06:49:47,900
when she retired

25119
06:49:47,900 --> 06:49:48,560
at night.

25120
06:49:48,560 --> 06:49:49,140
She asked the.

25121
06:49:49,140 --> 06:49:49,700
Chambermaid

25122
06:49:49,700 --> 06:49:50,420
whether Pemberley were

25123
06:49:50,420 --> 06:49:51,620
not a very fine place.

25124
06:49:51,860 --> 06:49:52,440
What the name

25125
06:49:52,440 --> 06:49:53,640
of its proprietor.

25126
06:49:53,700 --> 06:49:54,380
And with no

25127
06:49:54,380 --> 06:49:55,220
little alarm,

25128
06:49:55,220 --> 06:49:56,040
whether the family

25129
06:49:56,040 --> 06:49:56,360
were down

25130
06:49:56,360 --> 06:49:57,540
for the summer.

25131
06:49:57,540 --> 06:49:58,920
I most welcome negative

25132
06:49:58,920 --> 06:49:59,240
followed

25133
06:49:59,240 --> 06:50:00,380
the last question

25134
06:50:00,380 --> 06:50:01,200
and her alarm's

25135
06:50:01,200 --> 06:50:02,280
now being removed.

25136
06:50:02,280 --> 06:50:02,700
She was at

25137
06:50:02,700 --> 06:50:03,300
leisure to feel

25138
06:50:03,300 --> 06:50:03,800
a great deal

25139
06:50:03,800 --> 06:50:04,560
of curiosity,

25140
06:50:04,560 --> 06:50:04,760
to see

25141
06:50:04,760 --> 06:50:05,960
the house herself.

25142
06:50:05,960 --> 06:50:06,800
And when the subject

25143
06:50:06,800 --> 06:50:07,320
was revived

25144
06:50:07,320 --> 06:50:08,220
the next morning

25145
06:50:08,220 --> 06:50:08,900
and she was again

25146
06:50:08,900 --> 06:50:09,800
applied to.

25147
06:50:09,800 --> 06:50:09,980
Could.

25148
06:50:09,980 --> 06:50:10,800
Readily answer

25149
06:50:10,800 --> 06:50:11,460
and with a proper

25150
06:50:11,460 --> 06:50:12,560
air of.

25151
06:50:12,560 --> 06:50:13,020
That she had.

25152
06:50:13,020 --> 06:50:13,460
Not really

25153
06:50:13,460 --> 06:50:14,040
any dislike

25154
06:50:14,040 --> 06:50:15,180
to the scheme.

25155
06:50:15,180 --> 06:50:16,460
To Pemberley, therefore,

25156
06:50:16,520 --> 06:50:17,400
they were to go.

25157
06:50:19,040 --> 06:50:20,240
Chapter 43.

25158
06:50:21,680 --> 06:50:22,380
Elizabeth,

25159
06:50:22,380 --> 06:50:23,580
as they drove along,

25160
06:50:23,580 --> 06:50:24,120
watched

25161
06:50:24,120 --> 06:50:25,160
for the first appearance

25162
06:50:25,160 --> 06:50:26,100
of Pemberley words

25163
06:50:26,100 --> 06:50:27,300
with some perturbation.

25164
06:50:27,500 --> 06:50:28,460
And when at last

25165
06:50:28,460 --> 06:50:28,940
they turned in

25166
06:50:28,940 --> 06:50:29,820
at the lodge.

25167
06:50:29,820 --> 06:50:30,800
Her spirits were in

25168
06:50:30,800 --> 06:50:32,000
a high flutter.

25169
06:50:32,220 --> 06:50:33,680
The park was very large

25170
06:50:33,840 --> 06:50:34,640
and contained.

25171
06:50:34,640 --> 06:50:36,300
Great variety of ground.

25172
06:50:36,720 --> 06:50:37,500
They entered it

25173
06:50:37,500 --> 06:50:37,880
in one of

25174
06:50:37,880 --> 06:50:39,080
its lowest points

25175
06:50:39,080 --> 06:50:40,380
and drove for some time

25176
06:50:40,380 --> 06:50:41,340
through a beautiful wood

25177
06:50:41,340 --> 06:50:42,020
stretching over

25178
06:50:42,020 --> 06:50:43,220
a wide extend.

25179
06:50:43,800 --> 06:50:44,780
Elizabeth's mind

25180
06:50:44,780 --> 06:50:45,660
was too full

25181
06:50:45,660 --> 06:50:46,860
for conversation,

25182
06:50:46,860 --> 06:50:48,380
but she saw and admired

25183
06:50:48,380 --> 06:50:49,760
every remarkable spot

25184
06:50:49,760 --> 06:50:50,960
and point of view.

25185
06:50:51,260 --> 06:50:52,500
They gradually ascended

25186
06:50:52,500 --> 06:50:53,640
for a half mile

25187
06:50:53,640 --> 06:50:54,020
and then

25188
06:50:54,020 --> 06:50:54,840
found themselves

25189
06:50:54,840 --> 06:50:55,260
at the top

25190
06:50:55,260 --> 06:50:56,060
of a considerable

25191
06:50:56,060 --> 06:50:56,760
eminence

25192
06:50:56,760 --> 06:50:57,960
where the wood ceased

25193
06:50:57,980 --> 06:50:58,560
and the eye

25194
06:50:58,560 --> 06:50:59,720
was instantly caught

25195
06:50:59,720 --> 06:51:00,920
by Pemberley House,

25196
06:51:00,980 --> 06:51:02,240
situated on the opposite

25197
06:51:02,240 --> 06:51:03,320
side of a valley

25198
06:51:03,320 --> 06:51:04,340
into which the road

25199
06:51:04,340 --> 06:51:04,680
with some

25200
06:51:04,680 --> 06:51:05,880
abruptness wound.

25201
06:51:06,260 --> 06:51:07,160
It was a large,

25202
06:51:07,160 --> 06:51:08,580
handsome stone building,

25203
06:51:08,760 --> 06:51:09,320
standing

25204
06:51:09,320 --> 06:51:10,620
well on rising ground

25205
06:51:10,760 --> 06:51:12,000
and backed by a ridge

25206
06:51:12,000 --> 06:51:13,200
of high woody hills.

25207
06:51:13,520 --> 06:51:14,900
And in front a stream

25208
06:51:14,900 --> 06:51:15,200
of some

25209
06:51:15,200 --> 06:51:16,280
natural importance

25210
06:51:16,280 --> 06:51:16,860
were swelled

25211
06:51:16,860 --> 06:51:17,660
into greater,

25212
06:51:17,660 --> 06:51:18,420
but without any

25213
06:51:18,420 --> 06:51:19,620
artificial appearance.

25214
06:51:20,040 --> 06:51:20,700
Its Banks

25215
06:51:20,700 --> 06:51:21,420
were neither formal

25216
06:51:21,420 --> 06:51:22,620
nor falsely adorned.

25217
06:51:23,040 --> 06:51:24,440
Elizabeth was delighted.

25218
06:51:24,740 --> 06:51:25,400
She had never

25219
06:51:25,400 --> 06:51:26,040
seen a place

25220
06:51:26,040 --> 06:51:26,720
for which nature

25221
06:51:26,720 --> 06:51:28,040
had done more or where

25222
06:51:28,040 --> 06:51:29,240
natural beauty had been.

25223
06:51:29,240 --> 06:51:30,380
So little counteracted

25224
06:51:30,380 --> 06:51:31,580
by an awkward taste.

25225
06:51:32,000 --> 06:51:32,840
They were all of them,

25226
06:51:32,840 --> 06:51:33,240
warm in

25227
06:51:33,240 --> 06:51:34,440
their admiration.

25228
06:51:34,440 --> 06:51:35,640
And at that moment,

25229
06:51:35,640 --> 06:51:36,620
she felt that to be

25230
06:51:36,620 --> 06:51:37,760
mistress of Pemberley

25231
06:51:37,760 --> 06:51:38,960
might be something.

25232
06:51:39,180 --> 06:51:40,320
They descended the hill

25233
06:51:40,320 --> 06:51:41,480
crossed the bridge

25234
06:51:41,480 --> 06:51:42,780
and drove to the door.

25235
06:51:42,960 --> 06:51:43,400
And while

25236
06:51:43,400 --> 06:51:44,340
examining the near

25237
06:51:44,340 --> 06:51:45,540
aspect of the house,

25238
06:51:45,660 --> 06:51:46,740
all her apprehension

25239
06:51:46,740 --> 06:51:47,100
of meeting

25240
06:51:47,100 --> 06:51:48,300
its owner returned.

25241
06:51:48,440 --> 06:51:49,460
She dreaded lest

25242
06:51:49,460 --> 06:51:50,120
the chambermaid

25243
06:51:50,120 --> 06:51:51,300
had been mistaken

25244
06:51:51,300 --> 06:51:51,900
on applying

25245
06:51:51,900 --> 06:51:52,620
to see the place.

25246
06:51:52,620 --> 06:51:53,300
They were admitted

25247
06:51:53,300 --> 06:51:54,180
into the hall.

25248
06:51:54,180 --> 06:51:55,280
And Elizabeth, as they

25249
06:51:55,280 --> 06:51:55,640
waited for

25250
06:51:55,640 --> 06:51:56,600
the housekeeper,

25251
06:51:56,600 --> 06:51:57,140
had leisure

25252
06:51:57,140 --> 06:51:57,860
to wonder at her

25253
06:51:57,860 --> 06:51:59,060
being where she was.

25254
06:51:59,540 --> 06:52:00,200
The housekeeper

25255
06:52:00,200 --> 06:52:01,580
came a respectable

25256
06:52:01,580 --> 06:52:02,780
looking elderly woman,

25257
06:52:02,820 --> 06:52:03,860
much less fine

25258
06:52:03,860 --> 06:52:04,640
and more civil

25259
06:52:04,640 --> 06:52:05,100
than she had

25260
06:52:05,100 --> 06:52:05,700
any notion

25261
06:52:05,700 --> 06:52:06,780
of finding her.

25262
06:52:06,780 --> 06:52:07,460
They followed her

25263
06:52:07,460 --> 06:52:08,660
into the dining parlor.

25264
06:52:08,780 --> 06:52:09,600
It was a large

25265
06:52:09,600 --> 06:52:10,800
well-proportioned room,

25266
06:52:10,920 --> 06:52:12,120
handsomely fitted up.

25267
06:52:12,540 --> 06:52:13,380
Elizabeth After

25268
06:52:13,380 --> 06:52:14,240
slightly surveying,

25269
06:52:14,240 --> 06:52:15,300
it went to a window

25270
06:52:15,300 --> 06:52:16,520
to enjoy its prospect.

25271
06:52:16,980 --> 06:52:17,820
The hill, crowned

25272
06:52:17,820 --> 06:52:18,360
with wood,

25273
06:52:18,360 --> 06:52:18,660
which they

25274
06:52:18,660 --> 06:52:19,520
had descended,

25275
06:52:19,520 --> 06:52:20,720
receiving increased

25276
06:52:21,120 --> 06:52:22,020
from the distance,

25277
06:52:22,020 --> 06:52:23,420
was a beautiful object.

25278
06:52:23,900 --> 06:52:24,840
Every disposition

25279
06:52:24,840 --> 06:52:25,500
of the ground was.

25280
06:52:25,500 --> 06:52:26,040
Good,

25281
06:52:26,040 --> 06:52:26,420
and she

25282
06:52:26,420 --> 06:52:26,840
looked on the

25283
06:52:26,840 --> 06:52:27,660
whole scene.

25284
06:52:27,660 --> 06:52:28,400
The river,

25285
06:52:28,400 --> 06:52:28,980
the trees

25286
06:52:28,980 --> 06:52:30,120
scattered on its banks

25287
06:52:30,120 --> 06:52:30,860
and the winding

25288
06:52:30,860 --> 06:52:31,340
the valley.

25289
06:52:31,340 --> 06:52:32,040
As far as she could

25290
06:52:32,040 --> 06:52:33,600
trace it with delight

25291
06:52:34,100 --> 06:52:34,880
as they passed

25292
06:52:34,880 --> 06:52:35,760
into other rooms.

25293
06:52:35,760 --> 06:52:36,600
These objects

25294
06:52:36,600 --> 06:52:37,020
were taking

25295
06:52:37,020 --> 06:52:38,220
different positions,

25296
06:52:38,280 --> 06:52:39,380
but from every window

25297
06:52:39,380 --> 06:52:39,600
there were

25298
06:52:39,600 --> 06:52:40,800
beauties to be seen.

25299
06:52:41,220 --> 06:52:42,320
The rooms were lofty

25300
06:52:42,320 --> 06:52:43,200
and handsome

25301
06:52:43,200 --> 06:52:44,040
and their furniture

25302
06:52:44,040 --> 06:52:45,180
suitable to the fortunes

25303
06:52:45,180 --> 06:52:46,380
of its proprietor.

25304
06:52:46,560 --> 06:52:47,600
But Elizabeth saw

25305
06:52:47,600 --> 06:52:48,320
with admiration

25306
06:52:48,320 --> 06:52:49,140
of his taste

25307
06:52:49,140 --> 06:52:49,520
that it was

25308
06:52:49,520 --> 06:52:50,240
neither gaudy

25309
06:52:50,240 --> 06:52:51,440
nor uselessly fine,

25310
06:52:51,660 --> 06:52:52,980
with less of splendor

25311
06:52:52,980 --> 06:52:53,720
and more real

25312
06:52:53,720 --> 06:52:54,480
elegance than the

25313
06:52:54,480 --> 06:52:55,820
furniture of Rosen's.

25314
06:52:56,780 --> 06:52:58,240
And of this place.

25315
06:52:58,260 --> 06:52:59,460
Thought she.

25316
06:52:59,640 --> 06:53:00,300
I might have

25317
06:53:00,300 --> 06:53:01,500
been mistress.

25318
06:53:01,680 --> 06:53:02,780
With these rooms,

25319
06:53:02,780 --> 06:53:03,440
I might now

25320
06:53:03,440 --> 06:53:03,680
have been

25321
06:53:03,680 --> 06:53:04,920
familiarly acquainted.

25322
06:53:05,340 --> 06:53:06,180
Instead of viewing

25323
06:53:06,180 --> 06:53:07,140
them as a stranger,

25324
06:53:07,140 --> 06:53:07,580
I might have

25325
06:53:07,580 --> 06:53:08,280
rejoiced in them

25326
06:53:08,280 --> 06:53:09,920
as my own and welcomed

25327
06:53:09,920 --> 06:53:11,120
to them as visitors,

25328
06:53:11,360 --> 06:53:12,560
aunt and uncle.

25329
06:53:13,020 --> 06:53:14,100
But no.

25330
06:53:14,100 --> 06:53:15,300
Recollecting herself.

25331
06:53:15,660 --> 06:53:16,880
That could never be.

25332
06:53:17,100 --> 06:53:18,120
My aunt and uncle

25333
06:53:18,120 --> 06:53:18,480
would have been

25334
06:53:18,480 --> 06:53:19,380
lost to me.

25335
06:53:19,380 --> 06:53:19,920
I should not

25336
06:53:19,920 --> 06:53:20,460
have been allowed

25337
06:53:20,460 --> 06:53:21,660
to invite them.

25338
06:53:22,080 --> 06:53:22,740
This was a

25339
06:53:22,740 --> 06:53:23,940
lucky recollection.

25340
06:53:23,940 --> 06:53:24,720
It saved her

25341
06:53:24,720 --> 06:53:25,280
from something

25342
06:53:25,280 --> 06:53:26,540
very like regret.

25343
06:53:27,360 --> 06:53:28,200
She longed to

25344
06:53:28,200 --> 06:53:28,820
inquire of

25345
06:53:28,820 --> 06:53:29,520
the housekeeper

25346
06:53:29,520 --> 06:53:30,260
whether her master

25347
06:53:30,260 --> 06:53:31,260
was really absent,

25348
06:53:31,260 --> 06:53:32,420
but had not the courage

25349
06:53:32,420 --> 06:53:33,420
for it.

25350
06:53:33,420 --> 06:53:34,400
At length, however,

25351
06:53:34,400 --> 06:53:34,860
the question

25352
06:53:34,860 --> 06:53:36,060
was asked by her uncle,

25353
06:53:36,120 --> 06:53:36,900
and she turned away

25354
06:53:36,900 --> 06:53:38,000
with alarm, while Mrs.

25355
06:53:38,000 --> 06:53:38,760
Reynolds replied

25356
06:53:38,760 --> 06:53:40,100
that he was adding.

25357
06:53:40,580 --> 06:53:41,580
But we expect him

25358
06:53:41,580 --> 06:53:42,000
tomorrow

25359
06:53:42,000 --> 06:53:42,480
with the large

25360
06:53:42,480 --> 06:53:43,680
party friends.

25361
06:53:44,160 --> 06:53:44,880
How rejoiced

25362
06:53:44,880 --> 06:53:45,500
was Elizabeth

25363
06:53:45,500 --> 06:53:46,280
that their own journey

25364
06:53:46,280 --> 06:53:46,860
had not, by

25365
06:53:46,860 --> 06:53:47,760
any circumstance,

25366
06:53:47,760 --> 06:53:48,960
been delayed a day?

25367
06:53:49,580 --> 06:53:50,300
Her aunt now

25368
06:53:50,300 --> 06:53:50,720
called her

25369
06:53:50,720 --> 06:53:51,920
to look at a picture.

25370
06:53:52,080 --> 06:53:52,820
She approached

25371
06:53:52,820 --> 06:53:53,300
and saw

25372
06:53:53,300 --> 06:53:54,240
the likeness of Mr.

25373
06:53:54,240 --> 06:53:54,800
Wickham,

25374
06:53:54,800 --> 06:53:55,860
suspended amongst

25375
06:53:55,860 --> 06:53:56,960
several other miniatures

25376
06:53:56,960 --> 06:53:58,160
over the mantelpiece.

25377
06:53:58,400 --> 06:53:59,340
Her aunt asked her

25378
06:53:59,340 --> 06:54:00,540
smilingly how she liked.

25379
06:54:01,380 --> 06:54:02,060
The housekeeper

25380
06:54:02,060 --> 06:54:02,940
came forward

25381
06:54:02,940 --> 06:54:03,620
and told them

25382
06:54:03,620 --> 06:54:04,160
it was a picture

25383
06:54:04,160 --> 06:54:05,240
of a young gentleman,

25384
06:54:05,240 --> 06:54:06,080
the son of her late

25385
06:54:06,080 --> 06:54:07,220
master steward,

25386
06:54:07,220 --> 06:54:07,620
who had been

25387
06:54:07,620 --> 06:54:08,540
brought up by him

25388
06:54:08,540 --> 06:54:09,740
at his own expense.

25389
06:54:10,140 --> 06:54:10,940
He Has now gone

25390
06:54:10,940 --> 06:54:11,880
into the army,

25391
06:54:11,880 --> 06:54:12,720
she added.

25392
06:54:12,720 --> 06:54:13,800
But I am afraid

25393
06:54:13,800 --> 06:54:14,580
he has turned out

25394
06:54:14,580 --> 06:54:15,780
very wild.

25395
06:54:16,560 --> 06:54:16,940
Mrs.

25396
06:54:16,940 --> 06:54:17,540
Gardner looked

25397
06:54:17,540 --> 06:54:18,000
at her niece

25398
06:54:18,000 --> 06:54:18,840
with a smile.

25399
06:54:18,840 --> 06:54:19,520
But Elizabeth

25400
06:54:19,520 --> 06:54:20,720
could not return it.

25401
06:54:21,380 --> 06:54:22,940
And that said, Mrs.

25402
06:54:22,940 --> 06:54:23,700
Reynolds, pointing

25403
06:54:23,700 --> 06:54:24,140
to another of

25404
06:54:24,140 --> 06:54:25,040
the miniatures.

25405
06:54:25,040 --> 06:54:26,280
Is my master

25406
06:54:26,400 --> 06:54:27,600
and very like him.

25407
06:54:27,800 --> 06:54:28,440
It was drawn

25408
06:54:28,440 --> 06:54:29,120
at the same time

25409
06:54:29,120 --> 06:54:29,820
as the other

25410
06:54:29,820 --> 06:54:31,280
about eight years ago.

25411
06:54:32,120 --> 06:54:33,020
I have heard much

25412
06:54:33,020 --> 06:54:33,680
of your master's

25413
06:54:33,680 --> 06:54:34,880
fine person.

25414
06:54:35,000 --> 06:54:35,520
Said Mrs.

25415
06:54:35,520 --> 06:54:35,900
Gardner,

25416
06:54:35,900 --> 06:54:37,100
looking at the picture.

25417
06:54:37,260 --> 06:54:38,720
It is a handsome face.

25418
06:54:39,140 --> 06:54:39,860
But Lizzie you.

25419
06:54:39,860 --> 06:54:40,340
Can tell us

25420
06:54:40,340 --> 06:54:41,280
whether it is like or.

25421
06:54:41,280 --> 06:54:42,840
Not. Mrs.

25422
06:54:42,840 --> 06:54:43,700
Reynolds Respect

25423
06:54:43,700 --> 06:54:44,280
for Elizabeth

25424
06:54:44,280 --> 06:54:45,120
seemed to increase

25425
06:54:45,120 --> 06:54:45,960
on this intimation

25426
06:54:45,960 --> 06:54:46,160
of her

25427
06:54:46,160 --> 06:54:47,360
knowing her master.

25428
06:54:47,820 --> 06:54:48,860
Does that young lady

25429
06:54:48,860 --> 06:54:49,500
know Mr.

25430
06:54:49,500 --> 06:54:50,700
Darcy?

25431
06:54:50,780 --> 06:54:51,800
Elizabeth colored and.

25432
06:54:51,800 --> 06:54:53,160
Said a little.

25433
06:54:53,820 --> 06:54:54,740
And do you not think

25434
06:54:54,740 --> 06:54:55,640
of a very handsome

25435
06:54:55,640 --> 06:54:56,840
gentleman, ma'am?

25436
06:54:57,140 --> 06:54:58,640
Yes, very handsome.

25437
06:54:59,280 --> 06:55:00,180
I am sure I know

25438
06:55:00,180 --> 06:55:01,400
none so handsome.

25439
06:55:01,560 --> 06:55:02,400
But in the gallery.

25440
06:55:02,400 --> 06:55:02,900
Upstairs.

25441
06:55:02,900 --> 06:55:03,240
You will see

25442
06:55:03,240 --> 06:55:04,200
a finer, larger

25443
06:55:04,200 --> 06:55:04,740
picture of him

25444
06:55:04,740 --> 06:55:05,820
than this.

25445
06:55:05,820 --> 06:55:06,980
This room was my late

25446
06:55:06,980 --> 06:55:08,180
master's favorite room.

25447
06:55:08,340 --> 06:55:09,360
And these miniatures are

25448
06:55:09,360 --> 06:55:09,740
just as

25449
06:55:09,740 --> 06:55:10,800
they used to be then.

25450
06:55:10,800 --> 06:55:11,820
He was very

25451
06:55:11,820 --> 06:55:13,020
fond of them.

25452
06:55:13,320 --> 06:55:14,060
This accounted

25453
06:55:14,060 --> 06:55:15,060
to Elizabeth for Mr.

25454
06:55:15,060 --> 06:55:15,540
Wickham's

25455
06:55:15,540 --> 06:55:16,740
being among them.

25456
06:55:17,000 --> 06:55:17,340
Mrs.

25457
06:55:17,340 --> 06:55:17,720
Reynolds

25458
06:55:17,720 --> 06:55:18,800
then directed their

25459
06:55:18,800 --> 06:55:19,500
to one of Mrs.

25460
06:55:19,500 --> 06:55:20,480
Darcy Drawn

25461
06:55:20,480 --> 06:55:21,080
when she was only

25462
06:55:21,080 --> 06:55:22,280
eight years old.

25463
06:55:22,620 --> 06:55:23,940
And as Miss Darcy is

25464
06:55:23,940 --> 06:55:25,140
handsome as her brother.

25465
06:55:25,380 --> 06:55:25,920
Said Mrs.

25466
06:55:25,920 --> 06:55:26,960
Gardiner.

25467
06:55:26,960 --> 06:55:28,160
Oh, yes

25468
06:55:28,220 --> 06:55:29,120
The handsomest

25469
06:55:29,120 --> 06:55:29,640
young lady

25470
06:55:29,640 --> 06:55:30,660
that ever was seen

25471
06:55:30,660 --> 06:55:32,160
and so accomplished.

25472
06:55:32,400 --> 06:55:33,740
She plays and sings

25473
06:55:33,740 --> 06:55:34,940
all day long.

25474
06:55:35,160 --> 06:55:36,000
And the next room

25475
06:55:36,000 --> 06:55:36,720
is a new instrument.

25476
06:55:36,720 --> 06:55:37,920
Just come down for her

25477
06:55:38,060 --> 06:55:38,580
a present

25478
06:55:38,580 --> 06:55:39,680
from my master.

25479
06:55:39,680 --> 06:55:40,800
She comes here tomorrow

25480
06:55:40,800 --> 06:55:42,000
with him.

25481
06:55:42,120 --> 06:55:42,440
Mr.

25482
06:55:42,440 --> 06:55:42,900
Gardiner,

25483
06:55:42,900 --> 06:55:43,500
whose manners

25484
06:55:43,500 --> 06:55:44,160
were very easy

25485
06:55:44,160 --> 06:55:44,960
and pleasant,

25486
06:55:44,960 --> 06:55:45,720
encouraged her

25487
06:55:45,720 --> 06:55:46,560
communicative ness

25488
06:55:46,560 --> 06:55:47,400
by his questions

25489
06:55:47,400 --> 06:55:48,420
and remarks.

25490
06:55:48,420 --> 06:55:48,800
Mrs.

25491
06:55:48,800 --> 06:55:49,560
Reynolds, either

25492
06:55:49,560 --> 06:55:50,840
by pride or attachment,

25493
06:55:51,020 --> 06:55:51,780
had evidently

25494
06:55:51,780 --> 06:55:52,440
great pleasure

25495
06:55:52,440 --> 06:55:53,060
in talking of her

25496
06:55:53,060 --> 06:55:54,320
master and his sister.

25497
06:55:55,020 --> 06:55:55,640
Is your master

25498
06:55:55,640 --> 06:55:56,360
much at Pemberley

25499
06:55:56,360 --> 06:55:56,820
in the course

25500
06:55:56,820 --> 06:55:57,380
of the year?

25501
06:55:58,640 --> 06:55:59,300
Not so

25502
06:55:59,300 --> 06:56:00,500
much as I could wish.

25503
06:56:00,660 --> 06:56:01,560
But I dare say

25504
06:56:01,560 --> 06:56:02,220
he may spend

25505
06:56:02,220 --> 06:56:03,380
half his time here.

25506
06:56:03,380 --> 06:56:03,780
And Miss

25507
06:56:03,780 --> 06:56:04,820
Darcy is always down

25508
06:56:04,820 --> 06:56:06,020
for the summer months.

25509
06:56:06,440 --> 06:56:07,400
Except

25510
06:56:07,400 --> 06:56:08,480
Thought Elizabeth

25511
06:56:08,480 --> 06:56:09,260
when she goes

25512
06:56:09,260 --> 06:56:10,460
to Ramsgate.

25513
06:56:10,980 --> 06:56:11,600
If you must

25514
06:56:11,600 --> 06:56:12,180
have would marry.

25515
06:56:12,180 --> 06:56:12,740
You might see

25516
06:56:12,740 --> 06:56:13,940
more of him.

25517
06:56:14,780 --> 06:56:15,800
Yes, sir.

25518
06:56:15,800 --> 06:56:16,620
But I do not know

25519
06:56:16,620 --> 06:56:17,660
when that be.

25520
06:56:17,660 --> 06:56:18,360
I do not know

25521
06:56:18,360 --> 06:56:18,740
who is good

25522
06:56:18,740 --> 06:56:19,940
enough for him.

25523
06:56:20,060 --> 06:56:20,820
Mr. and Mrs.

25524
06:56:20,820 --> 06:56:22,020
Gardiner smiled.

25525
06:56:22,040 --> 06:56:22,520
Elizabeth

25526
06:56:22,520 --> 06:56:23,720
could not help, saying.

25527
06:56:24,060 --> 06:56:24,840
It is very much

25528
06:56:24,840 --> 06:56:25,440
to his credit.

25529
06:56:25,440 --> 06:56:26,000
I am sure that

25530
06:56:26,000 --> 06:56:27,200
you should think so.

25531
06:56:27,200 --> 06:56:28,260
I say no more

25532
06:56:28,260 --> 06:56:29,000
than the truth.

25533
06:56:29,000 --> 06:56:30,140
And everybody will say

25534
06:56:30,140 --> 06:56:31,340
that knows him.

25535
06:56:31,460 --> 06:56:32,660
Replied the other.

25536
06:56:32,760 --> 06:56:33,560
Elizabeth thought

25537
06:56:33,560 --> 06:56:34,100
this was going

25538
06:56:34,100 --> 06:56:34,920
pretty far

25539
06:56:34,920 --> 06:56:35,600
and she listened

25540
06:56:35,600 --> 06:56:36,200
with increasing

25541
06:56:36,200 --> 06:56:36,960
astonishment.

25542
06:56:36,960 --> 06:56:38,160
The housekeeper added.

25543
06:56:38,400 --> 06:56:39,300
I have never known

25544
06:56:39,300 --> 06:56:39,900
a cross word

25545
06:56:39,900 --> 06:56:40,920
from him in my life,

25546
06:56:40,920 --> 06:56:41,820
and I have known him

25547
06:56:41,820 --> 06:56:42,420
ever since he was

25548
06:56:42,420 --> 06:56:43,620
four years old.

25549
06:56:44,040 --> 06:56:45,140
This was praise

25550
06:56:45,140 --> 06:56:45,840
of all others.

25551
06:56:45,840 --> 06:56:47,040
Most extraordinary,

25552
06:56:47,220 --> 06:56:48,060
most opposite

25553
06:56:48,060 --> 06:56:49,260
to her ideas.

25554
06:56:49,340 --> 06:56:49,980
That he was.

25555
06:56:49,980 --> 06:56:50,880
Not a good tempered

25556
06:56:50,880 --> 06:56:51,440
man, had been

25557
06:56:51,440 --> 06:56:51,920
her firmest.

25558
06:56:51,920 --> 06:56:52,760
Opinion.

25559
06:56:52,760 --> 06:56:53,360
Her keenest

25560
06:56:53,360 --> 06:56:54,560
attention was awakened.

25561
06:56:54,660 --> 06:56:56,000
She longed to hear more

25562
06:56:56,160 --> 06:56:57,020
and was grateful,

25563
06:56:57,020 --> 06:56:58,040
her uncle, for saying.

25564
06:56:59,060 --> 06:56:59,300
There are

25565
06:56:59,300 --> 06:57:00,420
very few people of whom

25566
06:57:00,420 --> 06:57:01,620
so much can be said.

25567
06:57:01,800 --> 06:57:02,400
You are lucky

25568
06:57:02,400 --> 06:57:03,840
in having such a master.

25569
06:57:04,880 --> 06:57:05,700
Yes, sir.

25570
06:57:05,700 --> 06:57:06,900
I know I am.

25571
06:57:06,960 --> 06:57:07,440
If I were to

25572
06:57:07,440 --> 06:57:08,060
go through the world,

25573
06:57:08,060 --> 06:57:08,600
I could not

25574
06:57:08,600 --> 06:57:09,800
meet with the better.

25575
06:57:09,860 --> 06:57:10,580
But I have always

25576
06:57:10,580 --> 06:57:11,420
observed that they

25577
06:57:11,420 --> 06:57:12,180
who are good natured,

25578
06:57:12,180 --> 06:57:12,720
when children

25579
06:57:12,720 --> 06:57:13,400
are good natured,

25580
06:57:13,400 --> 06:57:14,280
when they grow up.

25581
06:57:14,280 --> 06:57:15,320
And he was always

25582
06:57:15,320 --> 06:57:16,680
the sweetest tempered,

25583
06:57:16,940 --> 06:57:18,000
generous hearted boy

25584
06:57:18,000 --> 06:57:19,200
in the world.

25585
06:57:19,400 --> 06:57:20,000
Elizabeth

25586
06:57:20,000 --> 06:57:21,200
almost stared at her.

25587
06:57:21,600 --> 06:57:22,680
Can this be Mr.

25588
06:57:22,680 --> 06:57:23,520
Darcy?

25589
06:57:23,520 --> 06:57:24,720
Thought she.

25590
06:57:25,040 --> 06:57:25,860
His father was

25591
06:57:25,860 --> 06:57:27,020
an excellent man.

25592
06:57:27,020 --> 06:57:27,560
Said Mrs.

25593
06:57:27,560 --> 06:57:28,500
Gardiner.

25594
06:57:28,500 --> 06:57:29,360
Yes, ma'am.

25595
06:57:29,360 --> 06:57:30,560
That he was indeed.

25596
06:57:30,620 --> 06:57:31,620
And his son will be

25597
06:57:31,620 --> 06:57:32,820
just like him,

25598
06:57:32,840 --> 06:57:33,960
just as affable

25599
06:57:33,960 --> 06:57:35,160
to the poor.

25600
06:57:35,580 --> 06:57:36,120
Elizabeth

25601
06:57:36,120 --> 06:57:37,320
listened.

25602
06:57:37,580 --> 06:57:38,280
Doubted.

25603
06:57:38,280 --> 06:57:39,120
And was impatient

25604
06:57:39,120 --> 06:57:40,040
for more.

25605
06:57:40,040 --> 06:57:40,400
Mrs.

25606
06:57:40,400 --> 06:57:40,980
Reynolds could

25607
06:57:40,980 --> 06:57:41,660
interest her on

25608
06:57:41,660 --> 06:57:42,860
no other point.

25609
06:57:43,040 --> 06:57:44,180
She related the subject

25610
06:57:44,180 --> 06:57:45,020
of the pictures,

25611
06:57:45,020 --> 06:57:45,660
the dimensions

25612
06:57:45,660 --> 06:57:46,220
of the rooms

25613
06:57:46,220 --> 06:57:46,880
and the price,

25614
06:57:46,880 --> 06:57:48,080
the furniture in vain.

25615
06:57:48,380 --> 06:57:48,740
Mr.

25616
06:57:48,740 --> 06:57:50,040
Gardiner, highly amused

25617
06:57:50,040 --> 06:57:50,960
by the kind of family

25618
06:57:50,960 --> 06:57:51,440
prejudice

25619
06:57:51,440 --> 06:57:52,320
to which he attributed

25620
06:57:52,320 --> 06:57:52,880
her excessive

25621
06:57:52,880 --> 06:57:53,520
commendation of

25622
06:57:53,520 --> 06:57:54,380
her master.

25623
06:57:54,380 --> 06:57:55,200
Soon led again

25624
06:57:55,200 --> 06:57:56,240
to the subject.

25625
06:57:56,240 --> 06:57:56,960
And she dwelt

25626
06:57:56,960 --> 06:57:57,540
with energy

25627
06:57:57,540 --> 06:57:58,640
on his many merits

25628
06:57:58,640 --> 06:57:59,400
as they proceeded

25629
06:57:59,400 --> 06:57:59,900
together up

25630
06:57:59,900 --> 06:58:01,100
the great staircase.

25631
06:58:01,560 --> 06:58:03,480
He is the best landlord

25632
06:58:03,480 --> 06:58:04,920
and the best master.

25633
06:58:05,220 --> 06:58:06,680
Said she, that ever

25634
06:58:07,380 --> 06:58:08,280
not like the wild

25635
06:58:08,280 --> 06:58:09,140
young men nowadays

25636
06:58:09,140 --> 06:58:09,740
who think of nothing

25637
06:58:09,740 --> 06:58:10,740
but themselves.

25638
06:58:10,740 --> 06:58:11,640
There is not one of

25639
06:58:11,640 --> 06:58:12,180
his tenants

25640
06:58:12,180 --> 06:58:12,740
or servants,

25641
06:58:12,740 --> 06:58:13,280
but will give him

25642
06:58:13,280 --> 06:58:14,400
a good name.

25643
06:58:14,400 --> 06:58:15,300
Some people call him

25644
06:58:15,300 --> 06:58:16,500
proud, but I am.

25645
06:58:16,520 --> 06:58:17,040
I never saw

25646
06:58:17,040 --> 06:58:17,960
anything of it.

25647
06:58:17,960 --> 06:58:18,840
To my fancy

25648
06:58:18,840 --> 06:58:19,220
it is only

25649
06:58:19,220 --> 06:58:19,700
because he does

25650
06:58:19,700 --> 06:58:20,520
not rattle away

25651
06:58:20,520 --> 06:58:21,720
like other young men

25652
06:58:21,860 --> 06:58:23,240
in what an amiable light

25653
06:58:23,240 --> 06:58:24,440
does this place him

25654
06:58:24,560 --> 06:58:25,760
thought Elizabeth,

25655
06:58:26,220 --> 06:58:26,880
this fine

25656
06:58:26,880 --> 06:58:27,840
account of him.

25657
06:58:27,840 --> 06:58:28,440
Whispered her

25658
06:58:28,440 --> 06:58:29,640
aunt as they walked.

25659
06:58:29,660 --> 06:58:30,500
Is not quite.

25660
06:58:30,500 --> 06:58:31,100
Consistent

25661
06:58:31,100 --> 06:58:31,380
with his

25662
06:58:31,380 --> 06:58:32,160
behavior to our.

25663
06:58:32,160 --> 06:58:32,940
Poor friend.

25664
06:58:33,980 --> 06:58:34,940
Perhaps we might

25665
06:58:34,940 --> 06:58:36,140
be deceived.

25666
06:58:36,420 --> 06:58:37,800
That is not very likely.

25667
06:58:38,060 --> 06:58:38,820
Our authority

25668
06:58:38,820 --> 06:58:40,020
was too good.

25669
06:58:40,340 --> 06:58:40,920
On reaching

25670
06:58:40,920 --> 06:58:41,480
the spacious

25671
06:58:41,480 --> 06:58:42,240
lobby above,

25672
06:58:42,240 --> 06:58:42,980
they were shown into a

25673
06:58:42,980 --> 06:58:44,180
very pretty sitting room

25674
06:58:44,340 --> 06:58:45,200
lately, fitted up

25675
06:58:45,200 --> 06:58:46,200
with greater elegance

25676
06:58:46,200 --> 06:58:46,880
and lightness

25677
06:58:46,880 --> 06:58:47,100
than the

25678
06:58:47,100 --> 06:58:48,240
apartments below,

25679
06:58:48,240 --> 06:58:49,040
and were informed

25680
06:58:49,040 --> 06:58:49,500
that it was but

25681
06:58:49,500 --> 06:58:50,180
just done

25682
06:58:50,180 --> 06:58:51,120
to give pleasure to Mr.

25683
06:58:51,120 --> 06:58:52,380
Darcy, who had taken

25684
06:58:52,380 --> 06:58:53,240
a liking to the room

25685
06:58:53,240 --> 06:58:54,440
when last at Pemberley.

25686
06:58:55,220 --> 06:58:55,920
He certainly

25687
06:58:55,920 --> 06:58:57,000
a good brother.

25688
06:58:57,000 --> 06:58:57,720
Said Elizabeth,

25689
06:58:57,720 --> 06:58:58,640
as she walked towards

25690
06:58:58,640 --> 06:58:59,840
one of the windows.

25691
06:59:00,060 --> 06:59:00,480
Mrs.

25692
06:59:00,480 --> 06:59:01,580
Reynolds anticipated

25693
06:59:01,580 --> 06:59:02,540
Miss Darcy's delight

25694
06:59:02,540 --> 06:59:02,960
when she should

25695
06:59:02,960 --> 06:59:04,160
enter the room.

25696
06:59:04,220 --> 06:59:05,880
And this is all ways

25697
06:59:05,880 --> 06:59:06,780
the way with him.

25698
06:59:06,780 --> 06:59:07,620
She added,

25699
06:59:07,620 --> 06:59:08,360
Whatever can

25700
06:59:08,360 --> 06:59:09,060
give his sister

25701
06:59:09,060 --> 06:59:09,980
any pleasure is sure

25702
06:59:09,980 --> 06:59:11,100
to be done in a moment.

25703
06:59:11,100 --> 06:59:11,960
There is nothing

25704
06:59:11,960 --> 06:59:13,160
he would not do for her.

25705
06:59:13,940 --> 06:59:14,940
The picture gallery

25706
06:59:14,940 --> 06:59:15,480
and two

25707
06:59:15,480 --> 06:59:15,800
or three

25708
06:59:15,800 --> 06:59:15,980
of the

25709
06:59:15,980 --> 06:59:17,180
principal bedrooms were

25710
06:59:17,180 --> 06:59:17,840
all that remain

25711
06:59:17,840 --> 06:59:18,840
to be shown,

25712
06:59:18,840 --> 06:59:19,580
and the former were

25713
06:59:19,580 --> 06:59:20,660
many good paintings.

25714
06:59:20,660 --> 06:59:21,440
But Elizabeth knew

25715
06:59:21,440 --> 06:59:22,520
nothing of the art

25716
06:59:22,520 --> 06:59:23,260
and from such

25717
06:59:23,260 --> 06:59:23,820
as had been already

25718
06:59:23,820 --> 06:59:24,800
visible below.

25719
06:59:24,800 --> 06:59:25,460
She had willingly

25720
06:59:25,460 --> 06:59:26,040
turned to look

25721
06:59:26,040 --> 06:59:26,700
at some drawings

25722
06:59:26,700 --> 06:59:27,540
of Miss Darcy's

25723
06:59:27,540 --> 06:59:28,400
and crayons,

25724
06:59:28,400 --> 06:59:29,160
whose subjects

25725
06:59:29,160 --> 06:59:29,640
were usually

25726
06:59:29,640 --> 06:59:30,440
more interesting

25727
06:59:30,440 --> 06:59:30,980
and also

25728
06:59:30,980 --> 06:59:32,180
more intelligible.

25729
06:59:32,640 --> 06:59:33,320
In the gallery,

25730
06:59:33,320 --> 06:59:33,500
there are

25731
06:59:33,500 --> 06:59:34,700
many family portraits,

25732
06:59:34,820 --> 06:59:35,280
but they could

25733
06:59:35,280 --> 06:59:35,760
have little

25734
06:59:35,760 --> 06:59:36,600
to fix the attention

25735
06:59:36,600 --> 06:59:37,740
of a stranger.

25736
06:59:37,740 --> 06:59:38,700
Elizabeth walked in

25737
06:59:38,700 --> 06:59:39,900
quest of the only face

25738
06:59:39,900 --> 06:59:40,460
whose features

25739
06:59:40,460 --> 06:59:41,640
would be known to her.

25740
06:59:41,640 --> 06:59:42,420
At last,

25741
06:59:42,420 --> 06:59:43,520
it arrested her

25742
06:59:43,520 --> 06:59:44,240
and she beheld

25743
06:59:44,240 --> 06:59:45,260
a striking resemblance

25744
06:59:45,260 --> 06:59:46,440
to Mr. Darcy.

25745
06:59:46,440 --> 06:59:47,540
With such a smile over

25746
06:59:47,540 --> 06:59:47,940
the face

25747
06:59:47,940 --> 06:59:48,480
as she remembered

25748
06:59:48,480 --> 06:59:49,400
to have sometimes seen,

25749
06:59:49,400 --> 06:59:50,600
when he looked at her,

25750
06:59:50,660 --> 06:59:51,140
she stood

25751
06:59:51,140 --> 06:59:51,860
several minutes

25752
06:59:51,860 --> 06:59:52,640
before the picture

25753
06:59:52,640 --> 06:59:53,960
in earnest contemplation

25754
06:59:54,240 --> 06:59:55,460
and returned to it again

25755
06:59:55,460 --> 06:59:56,160
before they quitted

25756
06:59:56,160 --> 06:59:57,240
the gallery.

25757
06:59:57,240 --> 06:59:57,560
Mrs.

25758
06:59:57,560 --> 06:59:58,760
Reynolds informed them

25759
06:59:58,800 --> 06:59:59,700
that it had been taken

25760
06:59:59,700 --> 06:59:59,900
in his

25761
06:59:59,900 --> 07:00:00,900
father's lifetime.

25762
07:00:02,000 --> 07:00:02,280
There was

25763
07:00:02,280 --> 07:00:03,500
certainly at this moment

25764
07:00:03,500 --> 07:00:04,500
in Elizabeth's mind,

25765
07:00:04,500 --> 07:00:05,700
a more gentle sensation

25766
07:00:05,700 --> 07:00:06,720
towards the original

25767
07:00:06,720 --> 07:00:07,620
than she had ever felt

25768
07:00:07,620 --> 07:00:08,000
at the height

25769
07:00:08,000 --> 07:00:09,200
of their acquaintance.

25770
07:00:09,200 --> 07:00:09,980
The commendation

25771
07:00:09,980 --> 07:00:11,060
bestowed on him by Mrs.

25772
07:00:11,060 --> 07:00:11,600
Reynolds was of

25773
07:00:11,600 --> 07:00:12,800
no trifling nature.

25774
07:00:13,200 --> 07:00:13,860
What's praise

25775
07:00:13,860 --> 07:00:14,540
is valuable

25776
07:00:14,540 --> 07:00:15,080
than the praise

25777
07:00:15,080 --> 07:00:15,240
of an

25778
07:00:15,240 --> 07:00:16,440
intelligent servant

25779
07:00:16,640 --> 07:00:17,480
as a brother,

25780
07:00:17,480 --> 07:00:18,920
a landlord, a master.

25781
07:00:19,160 --> 07:00:19,760
She considered

25782
07:00:19,760 --> 07:00:20,160
how many

25783
07:00:20,160 --> 07:00:21,060
people's happiness

25784
07:00:21,060 --> 07:00:21,300
were in

25785
07:00:21,300 --> 07:00:22,500
his guardianship.

25786
07:00:22,500 --> 07:00:23,480
How much of pleasure

25787
07:00:23,480 --> 07:00:24,000
or pain

25788
07:00:24,000 --> 07:00:24,800
was it in his power

25789
07:00:24,800 --> 07:00:25,700
to bestow?

25790
07:00:25,700 --> 07:00:27,020
How much of good or evil

25791
07:00:27,020 --> 07:00:28,220
must be done by him?

25792
07:00:28,520 --> 07:00:29,400
Every idea

25793
07:00:29,400 --> 07:00:29,760
that had been

25794
07:00:29,760 --> 07:00:30,540
brought forward

25795
07:00:30,540 --> 07:00:31,260
by the housekeeper

25796
07:00:31,260 --> 07:00:31,860
was favorable

25797
07:00:31,860 --> 07:00:33,000
to his character

25798
07:00:33,000 --> 07:00:33,720
and as she stood

25799
07:00:33,720 --> 07:00:34,500
before the canvas

25800
07:00:34,500 --> 07:00:34,800
on which

25801
07:00:34,800 --> 07:00:35,900
he was represented

25802
07:00:35,900 --> 07:00:36,380
and fixed

25803
07:00:36,380 --> 07:00:37,580
his eyes upon herself.

25804
07:00:37,860 --> 07:00:38,580
She thought of his.

25805
07:00:38,580 --> 07:00:38,960
Regard

25806
07:00:38,960 --> 07:00:39,440
with a deeper

25807
07:00:39,440 --> 07:00:40,560
sentiment of gratitude

25808
07:00:40,560 --> 07:00:41,100
than it ever

25809
07:00:41,100 --> 07:00:42,200
raised before.

25810
07:00:42,200 --> 07:00:42,740
She remembered

25811
07:00:42,740 --> 07:00:44,400
its warmth and softened.

25812
07:00:44,400 --> 07:00:45,380
Its impropriety

25813
07:00:45,380 --> 07:00:46,580
of expression.

25814
07:00:46,700 --> 07:00:47,660
When all of the house

25815
07:00:47,660 --> 07:00:48,160
that was open

25816
07:00:48,160 --> 07:00:48,620
to general

25817
07:00:48,620 --> 07:00:49,140
inspection

25818
07:00:49,140 --> 07:00:50,060
had been seen.

25819
07:00:50,060 --> 07:00:51,560
They returned downstairs

25820
07:00:51,840 --> 07:00:52,680
and taking leave of

25821
07:00:52,680 --> 07:00:53,580
the housekeeper

25822
07:00:53,580 --> 07:00:54,300
were consigned

25823
07:00:54,300 --> 07:00:55,380
over to the gardener

25824
07:00:55,380 --> 07:00:55,980
who met them

25825
07:00:55,980 --> 07:00:57,180
at the hall door

25826
07:00:57,300 --> 07:00:57,980
as they walked

25827
07:00:57,980 --> 07:00:58,700
across the hall

25828
07:00:58,700 --> 07:00:59,840
towards the river.

25829
07:00:59,840 --> 07:01:01,020
Elizabeth turned back

25830
07:01:01,020 --> 07:01:01,940
to look again.

25831
07:01:01,940 --> 07:01:03,000
Her aunt and uncle

25832
07:01:03,000 --> 07:01:04,140
stopped also.

25833
07:01:04,140 --> 07:01:04,980
And while the former

25834
07:01:04,980 --> 07:01:05,760
was conjecturing

25835
07:01:05,760 --> 07:01:06,260
as to the date

25836
07:01:06,260 --> 07:01:07,100
of the building,

25837
07:01:07,100 --> 07:01:08,360
the owner of it himself

25838
07:01:08,360 --> 07:01:09,320
suddenly came forward

25839
07:01:09,320 --> 07:01:10,100
from the road,

25840
07:01:10,100 --> 07:01:11,220
which led behind it

25841
07:01:11,220 --> 07:01:12,420
to the stables.

25842
07:01:12,660 --> 07:01:13,340
They were within

25843
07:01:13,340 --> 07:01:14,700
20 yards of each other

25844
07:01:14,900 --> 07:01:15,920
and so abrupt

25845
07:01:15,920 --> 07:01:16,920
with his appearance

25846
07:01:16,920 --> 07:01:17,940
that it was impossible

25847
07:01:17,940 --> 07:01:19,140
to avoid his sight.

25848
07:01:19,220 --> 07:01:20,660
Their eyes instantly met

25849
07:01:20,820 --> 07:01:21,920
and the cheeks of both

25850
07:01:21,920 --> 07:01:22,280
were over.

25851
07:01:22,280 --> 07:01:22,760
Spread

25852
07:01:22,760 --> 07:01:23,960
the deepest blush.

25853
07:01:24,180 --> 07:01:25,760
He absolutely stared

25854
07:01:25,920 --> 07:01:26,760
and for a moment

25855
07:01:26,760 --> 07:01:27,560
seemed immovable

25856
07:01:27,560 --> 07:01:28,680
from surprise.

25857
07:01:28,680 --> 07:01:29,240
But shortly

25858
07:01:29,240 --> 07:01:30,300
recovering himself,

25859
07:01:30,300 --> 07:01:30,900
advanced

25860
07:01:30,900 --> 07:01:32,000
toward the party

25861
07:01:32,000 --> 07:01:33,220
and spoke to Elizabeth,

25862
07:01:33,240 --> 07:01:34,160
if not in terms

25863
07:01:34,160 --> 07:01:35,360
of perfect composure,

25864
07:01:35,360 --> 07:01:36,020
at least of

25865
07:01:36,020 --> 07:01:37,220
perfect civility.

25866
07:01:37,800 --> 07:01:38,940
She had instinctively

25867
07:01:38,940 --> 07:01:39,680
turned away,

25868
07:01:39,680 --> 07:01:40,380
but stopping

25869
07:01:40,380 --> 07:01:41,420
on his approach

25870
07:01:41,420 --> 07:01:41,900
received,

25871
07:01:41,900 --> 07:01:42,600
his compliments

25872
07:01:42,600 --> 07:01:43,460
with an embarrassment,

25873
07:01:43,460 --> 07:01:44,100
impossible

25874
07:01:44,100 --> 07:01:45,300
to be overcome,

25875
07:01:45,320 --> 07:01:46,580
had his first appearance

25876
07:01:46,580 --> 07:01:47,400
or his resemblance

25877
07:01:47,400 --> 07:01:47,900
to the picture

25878
07:01:47,900 --> 07:01:48,320
they had just

25879
07:01:48,320 --> 07:01:49,220
been examining

25880
07:01:49,220 --> 07:01:50,100
been insufficient

25881
07:01:50,100 --> 07:01:51,000
to assure the other two

25882
07:01:51,000 --> 07:01:52,200
that they now saw Mr..

25883
07:01:52,620 --> 07:01:53,240
The gardener's

25884
07:01:53,240 --> 07:01:54,380
expression of surprise

25885
07:01:54,380 --> 07:01:55,580
and beholding his master

25886
07:01:55,620 --> 07:01:56,340
must immediately

25887
07:01:56,340 --> 07:01:57,320
have told it.

25888
07:01:57,320 --> 07:01:57,900
They stood a.

25889
07:01:57,900 --> 07:01:58,520
Little aloof

25890
07:01:58,520 --> 07:01:59,160
while he was talking

25891
07:01:59,160 --> 07:01:59,400
to their.

25892
07:01:59,400 --> 07:02:00,000
Niece,

25893
07:02:00,000 --> 07:02:01,040
who astonished and.

25894
07:02:01,040 --> 07:02:02,360
Confused scarcely

25895
07:02:02,360 --> 07:02:02,880
dared lift

25896
07:02:02,880 --> 07:02:04,080
her eyes to his face.

25897
07:02:04,160 --> 07:02:04,920
And knew not.

25898
07:02:04,920 --> 07:02:05,420
What answer.

25899
07:02:05,420 --> 07:02:06,080
She returned to

25900
07:02:06,080 --> 07:02:06,920
his civil inquiries

25901
07:02:06,920 --> 07:02:08,120
after her family

25902
07:02:08,160 --> 07:02:09,480
amazed at the alteration

25903
07:02:09,480 --> 07:02:10,020
of his manners

25904
07:02:10,020 --> 07:02:11,220
since they last parted.

25905
07:02:11,420 --> 07:02:12,240
Every sentence

25906
07:02:12,240 --> 07:02:12,840
that he uttered

25907
07:02:12,840 --> 07:02:13,560
was increasing

25908
07:02:13,560 --> 07:02:14,600
her embarrassment

25909
07:02:14,600 --> 07:02:15,480
and every idea

25910
07:02:15,480 --> 07:02:16,440
of the impropriety

25911
07:02:16,440 --> 07:02:17,460
of her being found there

25912
07:02:17,460 --> 07:02:18,660
recurring to her mind.

25913
07:02:18,860 --> 07:02:19,620
The few minutes

25914
07:02:19,620 --> 07:02:20,480
in which they continued

25915
07:02:20,480 --> 07:02:20,900
were some of

25916
07:02:20,900 --> 07:02:21,780
most uncomfortable

25917
07:02:21,780 --> 07:02:22,580
in her life.

25918
07:02:22,580 --> 07:02:23,700
Nor did he seem

25919
07:02:23,700 --> 07:02:24,900
much more at ease

25920
07:02:24,960 --> 07:02:25,800
when he spoke.

25921
07:02:25,800 --> 07:02:26,520
His accent

25922
07:02:26,520 --> 07:02:27,060
had none of its

25923
07:02:27,060 --> 07:02:28,260
usual sedate ness,

25924
07:02:28,260 --> 07:02:29,040
and he repeated

25925
07:02:29,040 --> 07:02:29,660
his inquiries

25926
07:02:29,660 --> 07:02:30,480
as to the time of her

25927
07:02:30,480 --> 07:02:31,680
having left long born

25928
07:02:31,680 --> 07:02:32,160
and of her

25929
07:02:32,160 --> 07:02:32,780
having stayed

25930
07:02:32,780 --> 07:02:34,620
in Derbyshire so often

25931
07:02:34,620 --> 07:02:35,820
and in so hurried away

25932
07:02:35,960 --> 07:02:36,900
as plainly spoke

25933
07:02:36,900 --> 07:02:37,620
the distraction

25934
07:02:37,620 --> 07:02:38,820
of his thoughts.

25935
07:02:38,960 --> 07:02:39,560
At length,

25936
07:02:39,560 --> 07:02:40,200
every idea

25937
07:02:40,200 --> 07:02:41,180
seemed to fail him,

25938
07:02:41,180 --> 07:02:41,640
and after

25939
07:02:41,640 --> 07:02:42,540
standing a few moments

25940
07:02:42,540 --> 07:02:43,740
without saying a word,

25941
07:02:43,740 --> 07:02:44,240
he suddenly

25942
07:02:44,240 --> 07:02:45,180
recollected himself

25943
07:02:45,180 --> 07:02:46,380
and took leave.

25944
07:02:46,920 --> 07:02:47,540
The others

25945
07:02:47,540 --> 07:02:48,300
then joined her

25946
07:02:48,300 --> 07:02:48,920
and expressed

25947
07:02:48,920 --> 07:02:49,560
admiration

25948
07:02:49,560 --> 07:02:50,480
of his figure.

25949
07:02:50,480 --> 07:02:51,320
But Elizabeth heard

25950
07:02:51,320 --> 07:02:52,700
not a word and wholly

25951
07:02:52,700 --> 07:02:53,640
engrossed by her own

25952
07:02:53,640 --> 07:02:54,300
feelings,

25953
07:02:54,300 --> 07:02:54,900
followed them

25954
07:02:54,900 --> 07:02:55,940
in silence.

25955
07:02:55,940 --> 07:02:57,180
She was overpowered

25956
07:02:57,180 --> 07:02:58,640
by shame and vexation.

25957
07:02:59,000 --> 07:02:59,520
Her coming

25958
07:02:59,520 --> 07:02:59,880
there was the

25959
07:02:59,880 --> 07:03:01,080
most unfortunate,

25960
07:03:01,140 --> 07:03:01,820
the most ill.

25961
07:03:01,820 --> 07:03:02,280
Judged.

25962
07:03:02,280 --> 07:03:03,480
Thing in the world.

25963
07:03:03,540 --> 07:03:04,220
How strange

25964
07:03:04,220 --> 07:03:05,420
it must appear to him.

25965
07:03:05,420 --> 07:03:05,760
And what a.

25966
07:03:05,760 --> 07:03:06,840
Disgraceful light.

25967
07:03:06,840 --> 07:03:07,740
Might it not strike

25968
07:03:07,740 --> 07:03:08,120
so vain?

25969
07:03:08,120 --> 07:03:09,680
A man it might seem, if.

25970
07:03:09,680 --> 07:03:10,460
She had purposely

25971
07:03:10,460 --> 07:03:11,160
thrown herself

25972
07:03:11,160 --> 07:03:11,580
in his way.

25973
07:03:11,580 --> 07:03:12,500
Again.

25974
07:03:12,500 --> 07:03:14,400
Oh, why did she come?

25975
07:03:14,640 --> 07:03:15,420
Or why did he does.

25976
07:03:15,420 --> 07:03:16,080
Come a day before

25977
07:03:16,080 --> 07:03:17,280
he was expected?

25978
07:03:17,460 --> 07:03:18,320
Had they been only

25979
07:03:18,320 --> 07:03:19,220
10 minutes sooner,

25980
07:03:19,220 --> 07:03:19,560
they should have

25981
07:03:19,560 --> 07:03:20,340
been beyond the reach

25982
07:03:20,340 --> 07:03:21,540
of his discrimination.

25983
07:03:21,600 --> 07:03:22,020
For it was.

25984
07:03:22,020 --> 07:03:22,740
Plain that he was

25985
07:03:22,740 --> 07:03:23,940
that moment arrived.

25986
07:03:24,060 --> 07:03:24,720
That moment

25987
07:03:24,720 --> 07:03:25,820
alighted from his horse

25988
07:03:25,820 --> 07:03:27,020
or his carriage.

25989
07:03:27,020 --> 07:03:28,140
She blushed again.

25990
07:03:28,140 --> 07:03:28,740
And again

25991
07:03:28,740 --> 07:03:29,480
over the perverse

25992
07:03:29,480 --> 07:03:29,840
ness of the.

25993
07:03:29,840 --> 07:03:31,820
Meeting and his behavior

25994
07:03:31,980 --> 07:03:33,420
so strikingly altered.

25995
07:03:33,720 --> 07:03:34,920
What could it mean

25996
07:03:35,060 --> 07:03:35,480
that he should.

25997
07:03:35,480 --> 07:03:36,500
Even speak to her was.

25998
07:03:36,500 --> 07:03:37,200
Amazing.

25999
07:03:37,200 --> 07:03:37,800
But to speak

26000
07:03:37,800 --> 07:03:39,000
with such civility,

26001
07:03:39,120 --> 07:03:39,720
to inquire.

26002
07:03:39,720 --> 07:03:40,920
After her family.

26003
07:03:41,100 --> 07:03:42,120
Never in her life

26004
07:03:42,120 --> 07:03:43,040
had she seen his manners

26005
07:03:43,040 --> 07:03:44,160
so little dignified.

26006
07:03:44,160 --> 07:03:44,700
Never had

26007
07:03:44,700 --> 07:03:45,240
he spoken

26008
07:03:45,240 --> 07:03:46,280
with such gentleness

26009
07:03:46,280 --> 07:03:46,700
as on this

26010
07:03:46,700 --> 07:03:47,900
unexpected meeting.

26011
07:03:48,360 --> 07:03:49,380
What a country

26012
07:03:49,380 --> 07:03:50,660
did it offer to his last

26013
07:03:50,660 --> 07:03:51,020
address

26014
07:03:51,020 --> 07:03:52,100
and rousing spark

26015
07:03:52,100 --> 07:03:52,680
when he put his

26016
07:03:52,680 --> 07:03:53,880
letter into her hand.

26017
07:03:54,020 --> 07:03:54,600
She knew not.

26018
07:03:54,600 --> 07:03:55,380
What to think

26019
07:03:55,380 --> 07:03:56,000
or how to

26020
07:03:56,000 --> 07:03:57,200
account for it.

26021
07:03:57,440 --> 07:03:58,280
They had now entered

26022
07:03:58,280 --> 07:03:59,060
a beautiful walk

26023
07:03:59,060 --> 07:03:59,540
by the side

26024
07:03:59,540 --> 07:04:00,320
of the water,

26025
07:04:00,320 --> 07:04:01,220
and every step

26026
07:04:01,220 --> 07:04:02,060
was bringing forward

26027
07:04:02,060 --> 07:04:03,260
a nobler fall of ground

26028
07:04:03,440 --> 07:04:04,100
or a finer

26029
07:04:04,100 --> 07:04:04,860
reach of the woods

26030
07:04:04,860 --> 07:04:05,160
to which

26031
07:04:05,160 --> 07:04:06,360
they were approaching.

26032
07:04:06,380 --> 07:04:07,280
But it was some time

26033
07:04:07,280 --> 07:04:07,980
before Elizabeth,

26034
07:04:07,980 --> 07:04:08,540
the sensible

26035
07:04:08,540 --> 07:04:09,560
of any of it.

26036
07:04:09,560 --> 07:04:10,520
And though she answered

26037
07:04:10,520 --> 07:04:11,100
mechanically

26038
07:04:11,100 --> 07:04:12,120
to the repeated appeals

26039
07:04:12,120 --> 07:04:13,320
of her aunt and uncle,

26040
07:04:13,340 --> 07:04:13,860
and seemed to

26041
07:04:13,860 --> 07:04:14,640
direct her eyes

26042
07:04:14,640 --> 07:04:15,560
to such objects,

26043
07:04:15,560 --> 07:04:16,520
they pointed out

26044
07:04:16,520 --> 07:04:17,240
she distinguished

26045
07:04:17,240 --> 07:04:18,440
no part of the scene.

26046
07:04:18,780 --> 07:04:19,400
Her thoughts

26047
07:04:19,400 --> 07:04:20,300
were all fixed

26048
07:04:20,300 --> 07:04:20,580
on that

26049
07:04:20,580 --> 07:04:21,360
one spot

26050
07:04:21,360 --> 07:04:22,340
at Pemberley House,

26051
07:04:22,340 --> 07:04:23,540
whichever it might be.

26052
07:04:23,660 --> 07:04:24,080
Where Mr.

26053
07:04:24,080 --> 07:04:25,280
Darcy then was.

26054
07:04:25,620 --> 07:04:26,780
She longed to know what.

26055
07:04:26,780 --> 07:04:27,240
At the moment

26056
07:04:27,240 --> 07:04:28,440
was passing in his mind

26057
07:04:28,520 --> 07:04:29,300
in what manner

26058
07:04:29,300 --> 07:04:30,260
he thought of her,

26059
07:04:30,260 --> 07:04:31,460
and whether in defiance

26060
07:04:31,460 --> 07:04:32,340
of everything

26061
07:04:32,340 --> 07:04:33,080
she was still

26062
07:04:33,080 --> 07:04:34,280
dear to him.

26063
07:04:34,520 --> 07:04:35,820
Perhaps he'd been civil

26064
07:04:35,820 --> 07:04:36,480
only because

26065
07:04:36,480 --> 07:04:37,680
he felt himself at ease.

26066
07:04:38,040 --> 07:04:39,060
Yet There had been that

26067
07:04:39,060 --> 07:04:39,620
in his voice,

26068
07:04:39,620 --> 07:04:40,860
which was not like ease.

26069
07:04:41,180 --> 07:04:42,000
Whether he had felt

26070
07:04:42,000 --> 07:04:42,720
more of pain

26071
07:04:42,720 --> 07:04:43,320
or of pleasure

26072
07:04:43,320 --> 07:04:43,860
in seeing her,

26073
07:04:43,860 --> 07:04:45,060
she could not tell.

26074
07:04:45,120 --> 07:04:46,220
But he certainly had not

26075
07:04:46,220 --> 07:04:47,480
seen her with composure

26076
07:04:47,900 --> 07:04:48,540
at length.

26077
07:04:48,540 --> 07:04:48,860
However,

26078
07:04:48,860 --> 07:04:49,340
the remarks

26079
07:04:49,340 --> 07:04:50,100
of her companions

26080
07:04:50,100 --> 07:04:51,240
on her absence of mind

26081
07:04:51,240 --> 07:04:52,080
aroused her,

26082
07:04:52,080 --> 07:04:52,580
and she felt

26083
07:04:52,580 --> 07:04:53,180
the necessity

26084
07:04:53,180 --> 07:04:53,700
of appearing

26085
07:04:53,700 --> 07:04:54,900
more like herself.

26086
07:04:55,220 --> 07:04:56,400
They entered the woods

26087
07:04:56,400 --> 07:04:57,180
and putting a due

26088
07:04:57,180 --> 07:04:57,600
to the river

26089
07:04:57,600 --> 07:04:58,820
for a while ascended

26090
07:04:58,820 --> 07:04:59,160
some of the

26091
07:04:59,160 --> 07:05:00,140
higher grounds

26092
07:05:00,140 --> 07:05:01,020
when in spots

26093
07:05:01,020 --> 07:05:01,620
where the opening

26094
07:05:01,620 --> 07:05:02,180
of the trees

26095
07:05:02,180 --> 07:05:03,080
gave the AI power

26096
07:05:03,080 --> 07:05:03,860
to wander,

26097
07:05:03,860 --> 07:05:04,320
where many

26098
07:05:04,320 --> 07:05:05,040
charming views

26099
07:05:05,040 --> 07:05:05,780
of the valley,

26100
07:05:05,780 --> 07:05:06,960
the opposite dales

26101
07:05:06,960 --> 07:05:07,560
with the long

26102
07:05:07,560 --> 07:05:08,360
range of woods

26103
07:05:08,360 --> 07:05:09,500
over spending money

26104
07:05:09,500 --> 07:05:10,580
and occasionally part

26105
07:05:10,580 --> 07:05:12,080
of the stream, Mr.

26106
07:05:12,080 --> 07:05:12,980
Gardner expressed

26107
07:05:12,980 --> 07:05:13,620
a wish of going

26108
07:05:13,620 --> 07:05:14,820
round to the whole park,

26109
07:05:14,820 --> 07:05:15,420
but feared

26110
07:05:15,420 --> 07:05:15,880
it might be

26111
07:05:15,880 --> 07:05:17,080
beyond a walk

26112
07:05:17,340 --> 07:05:18,440
with a triumphant smile.

26113
07:05:18,440 --> 07:05:18,920
They were told

26114
07:05:18,920 --> 07:05:19,520
that it was ten

26115
07:05:19,520 --> 07:05:20,720
miles round.

26116
07:05:20,780 --> 07:05:21,900
It settled the matter

26117
07:05:21,900 --> 07:05:22,700
and they pursued

26118
07:05:22,700 --> 07:05:23,900
the accustomed circuit,

26119
07:05:23,960 --> 07:05:25,020
which brought them again

26120
07:05:25,020 --> 07:05:25,860
after some time,

26121
07:05:25,860 --> 07:05:26,460
and a descent.

26122
07:05:26,460 --> 07:05:27,540
Among hanging woods.

26123
07:05:27,540 --> 07:05:28,740
To the edge of the water

26124
07:05:28,800 --> 07:05:29,460
and one of its

26125
07:05:29,460 --> 07:05:30,660
narrowest parts.

26126
07:05:30,840 --> 07:05:31,620
They crossed it

26127
07:05:31,620 --> 07:05:32,820
by a simple bridge

26128
07:05:32,820 --> 07:05:33,680
in character

26129
07:05:33,680 --> 07:05:34,260
with the general

26130
07:05:34,260 --> 07:05:35,300
Arab scene.

26131
07:05:35,300 --> 07:05:36,240
It was a spot

26132
07:05:36,240 --> 07:05:37,620
less adorned than any

26133
07:05:37,620 --> 07:05:38,820
they had yet visited,

26134
07:05:38,900 --> 07:05:39,920
and the valley here

26135
07:05:39,920 --> 07:05:41,120
contracted into a glen

26136
07:05:41,360 --> 07:05:42,060
allowed room

26137
07:05:42,060 --> 07:05:43,140
only for the stream

26138
07:05:43,140 --> 07:05:44,400
and a narrow walk amidst

26139
07:05:44,400 --> 07:05:45,540
the rough coppice wood.

26140
07:05:45,540 --> 07:05:46,740
Which bordered it.

26141
07:05:46,800 --> 07:05:47,820
Elizabeth

26142
07:05:47,820 --> 07:05:49,260
to explore its windings.

26143
07:05:49,560 --> 07:05:50,040
But when they

26144
07:05:50,040 --> 07:05:50,520
had crossed.

26145
07:05:50,520 --> 07:05:51,080
The bridge

26146
07:05:51,080 --> 07:05:51,680
and perceived

26147
07:05:51,680 --> 07:05:52,520
their distance from the.

26148
07:05:52,520 --> 07:05:53,280
House.

26149
07:05:53,280 --> 07:05:53,640
Mrs.

26150
07:05:53,640 --> 07:05:54,200
Gardner,

26151
07:05:54,200 --> 07:05:54,660
who was not

26152
07:05:54,660 --> 07:05:55,880
a great walker, could go

26153
07:05:55,880 --> 07:05:57,200
no further and thought

26154
07:05:57,200 --> 07:05:58,020
only of returning

26155
07:05:58,020 --> 07:05:58,620
to the carriage

26156
07:05:58,620 --> 07:05:59,820
as quickly as possible.

26157
07:06:00,140 --> 07:06:00,620
Her niece

26158
07:06:00,620 --> 07:06:01,320
was therefore

26159
07:06:01,320 --> 07:06:02,480
obliged to submit

26160
07:06:02,480 --> 07:06:03,440
and they took their way

26161
07:06:03,440 --> 07:06:04,260
towards the house

26162
07:06:04,260 --> 07:06:04,860
on the opposite

26163
07:06:04,860 --> 07:06:05,720
side of the river

26164
07:06:05,720 --> 07:06:06,000
in the

26165
07:06:06,000 --> 07:06:07,200
nearest direction.

26166
07:06:07,340 --> 07:06:08,220
But their progress

26167
07:06:08,220 --> 07:06:08,900
was slow.

26168
07:06:08,900 --> 07:06:09,420
For Mr.

26169
07:06:09,420 --> 07:06:10,140
Gardiner, though

26170
07:06:10,140 --> 07:06:11,340
seldom able to indulge,

26171
07:06:11,340 --> 07:06:12,000
the taste,

26172
07:06:12,000 --> 07:06:12,620
was very

26173
07:06:12,620 --> 07:06:13,580
fond of fishing,

26174
07:06:13,580 --> 07:06:14,420
and with so much

26175
07:06:14,420 --> 07:06:15,060
engaged in

26176
07:06:15,060 --> 07:06:16,080
watching the occasional

26177
07:06:16,080 --> 07:06:16,640
appearance of,

26178
07:06:16,640 --> 07:06:17,840
some trout in the water

26179
07:06:17,960 --> 07:06:19,020
and talking to the man

26180
07:06:19,020 --> 07:06:19,700
about them

26181
07:06:19,700 --> 07:06:20,540
that he advanced

26182
07:06:20,540 --> 07:06:21,560
but little.

26183
07:06:21,560 --> 07:06:22,700
Whilst wandering on in.

26184
07:06:22,700 --> 07:06:23,660
This slow manner,

26185
07:06:23,660 --> 07:06:24,300
they were again

26186
07:06:24,300 --> 07:06:24,980
surprised.

26187
07:06:24,980 --> 07:06:25,640
And Elizabeth's

26188
07:06:25,640 --> 07:06:26,240
astonishment

26189
07:06:26,240 --> 07:06:27,060
was quite equal

26190
07:06:27,060 --> 07:06:27,500
to what it had

26191
07:06:27,500 --> 07:06:28,380
been at first

26192
07:06:28,380 --> 07:06:29,340
by the sight of Mr.

26193
07:06:29,340 --> 07:06:30,540
Darcy approaching them

26194
07:06:30,540 --> 07:06:30,860
and at

26195
07:06:30,860 --> 07:06:32,060
no great distance.

26196
07:06:32,220 --> 07:06:32,700
The walk.

26197
07:06:32,700 --> 07:06:33,900
Here, being here less

26198
07:06:33,900 --> 07:06:34,520
sheltered than

26199
07:06:34,520 --> 07:06:35,480
on the other side,

26200
07:06:35,480 --> 07:06:36,560
allowed them to see him

26201
07:06:36,560 --> 07:06:37,740
before they met.

26202
07:06:37,740 --> 07:06:38,280
Elizabeth,

26203
07:06:38,280 --> 07:06:39,240
however astonished,

26204
07:06:39,240 --> 07:06:39,720
was at least

26205
07:06:39,720 --> 07:06:40,440
more prepared

26206
07:06:40,440 --> 07:06:41,060
for an interview

26207
07:06:41,060 --> 07:06:42,000
than before

26208
07:06:42,000 --> 07:06:43,380
and resolved to appear

26209
07:06:43,380 --> 07:06:43,980
and to speak

26210
07:06:43,980 --> 07:06:44,700
with calmness

26211
07:06:44,700 --> 07:06:45,740
if he really intended

26212
07:06:45,740 --> 07:06:46,860
to meet them.

26213
07:06:46,860 --> 07:06:47,120
For a.

26214
07:06:47,120 --> 07:06:47,700
Few moments.

26215
07:06:47,700 --> 07:06:48,020
Indeed,

26216
07:06:48,020 --> 07:06:48,680
she felt that he would

26217
07:06:48,680 --> 07:06:49,400
probably strike

26218
07:06:49,400 --> 07:06:50,600
into some other path.

26219
07:06:50,660 --> 07:06:51,620
The idea lasted

26220
07:06:51,620 --> 07:06:52,100
while the turning

26221
07:06:52,100 --> 07:06:52,560
in the walk

26222
07:06:52,560 --> 07:06:53,160
concealed him

26223
07:06:53,160 --> 07:06:54,080
from their view,

26224
07:06:54,080 --> 07:06:55,200
the turning past.

26225
07:06:55,200 --> 07:06:55,940
He Was immediately

26226
07:06:55,940 --> 07:06:57,000
before them

26227
07:06:57,000 --> 07:06:57,780
with a glance.

26228
07:06:57,780 --> 07:06:58,760
She saw that he had lost

26229
07:06:58,760 --> 07:06:59,360
none of his

26230
07:06:59,360 --> 07:07:00,560
recent civility

26231
07:07:00,560 --> 07:07:00,980
and to

26232
07:07:00,980 --> 07:07:02,180
imitate his politeness.

26233
07:07:02,360 --> 07:07:03,620
She began, as they met

26234
07:07:03,800 --> 07:07:04,320
to admire

26235
07:07:04,320 --> 07:07:05,520
the beauty of the place.

26236
07:07:05,720 --> 07:07:06,680
But she had not got

26237
07:07:06,680 --> 07:07:07,040
beyond the.

26238
07:07:07,040 --> 07:07:07,380
Words

26239
07:07:07,380 --> 07:07:09,060
delightful and charming.

26240
07:07:09,260 --> 07:07:10,220
When some unlucky

26241
07:07:10,220 --> 07:07:11,420
recollections of traded

26242
07:07:11,580 --> 07:07:12,300
and she fancy

26243
07:07:12,300 --> 07:07:12,840
that praise

26244
07:07:12,840 --> 07:07:14,040
of Pemberley from her

26245
07:07:14,060 --> 07:07:14,960
might be mischievously

26246
07:07:14,960 --> 07:07:15,920
construed,

26247
07:07:15,920 --> 07:07:17,060
her color changed.

26248
07:07:17,060 --> 07:07:17,700
And she said no.

26249
07:07:17,700 --> 07:07:18,800
More. Mrs.

26250
07:07:18,800 --> 07:07:19,220
Gardiner

26251
07:07:19,220 --> 07:07:19,740
was standing

26252
07:07:19,740 --> 07:07:20,700
a little behind,

26253
07:07:20,700 --> 07:07:21,900
and on her pausing,

26254
07:07:21,920 --> 07:07:22,680
he asked her

26255
07:07:22,680 --> 07:07:23,420
if she would do him

26256
07:07:23,420 --> 07:07:23,900
the honor of

26257
07:07:23,900 --> 07:07:24,600
introducing him

26258
07:07:24,600 --> 07:07:25,760
to her friends.

26259
07:07:25,760 --> 07:07:26,640
This was a stroke

26260
07:07:26,640 --> 07:07:27,200
of civility

26261
07:07:27,200 --> 07:07:27,560
for which

26262
07:07:27,560 --> 07:07:29,040
she was quite unprepared

26263
07:07:29,220 --> 07:07:29,580
and could

26264
07:07:29,580 --> 07:07:30,360
hardly suppress

26265
07:07:30,360 --> 07:07:31,680
a smile at his being.

26266
07:07:31,680 --> 07:07:32,340
Now seeking

26267
07:07:32,340 --> 07:07:32,940
the acquaintance

26268
07:07:32,940 --> 07:07:33,440
of some of those

26269
07:07:33,440 --> 07:07:34,500
very people against

26270
07:07:34,500 --> 07:07:35,280
whom his Pride

26271
07:07:35,280 --> 07:07:36,180
had revolted

26272
07:07:36,180 --> 07:07:37,460
in his offer to herself.

26273
07:07:38,180 --> 07:07:38,880
What would be

26274
07:07:38,880 --> 07:07:40,020
his surprise?

26275
07:07:40,020 --> 07:07:40,820
Thought she.

26276
07:07:40,820 --> 07:07:41,640
When he knows who

26277
07:07:41,640 --> 07:07:42,420
they are,

26278
07:07:42,420 --> 07:07:43,020
he takes the

26279
07:07:43,020 --> 07:07:43,740
now for people

26280
07:07:43,740 --> 07:07:44,940
of fashion.

26281
07:07:45,180 --> 07:07:45,960
The introduction,

26282
07:07:45,960 --> 07:07:46,280
however,

26283
07:07:46,280 --> 07:07:47,420
was immediately made,

26284
07:07:47,420 --> 07:07:48,300
and as she named

26285
07:07:48,300 --> 07:07:49,020
their relationship

26286
07:07:49,020 --> 07:07:49,800
to herself.

26287
07:07:49,800 --> 07:07:50,000
She.

26288
07:07:50,000 --> 07:07:51,260
Stole a sly look at him

26289
07:07:51,260 --> 07:07:52,460
to see how he bought

26290
07:07:52,500 --> 07:07:53,460
and was not without

26291
07:07:53,460 --> 07:07:54,320
the expectation

26292
07:07:54,320 --> 07:07:55,620
of his decamping as fast

26293
07:07:55,620 --> 07:07:56,060
as he could

26294
07:07:56,060 --> 07:07:56,460
from such

26295
07:07:56,460 --> 07:07:57,800
disgraceful companions.

26296
07:07:58,280 --> 07:07:59,400
But he was surprised by

26297
07:07:59,400 --> 07:07:59,900
the connection

26298
07:07:59,900 --> 07:08:00,800
was evident.

26299
07:08:00,800 --> 07:08:01,500
He sustained

26300
07:08:01,500 --> 07:08:01,980
it, however,

26301
07:08:01,980 --> 07:08:03,000
with fortitude.

26302
07:08:03,000 --> 07:08:03,540
And so far.

26303
07:08:03,540 --> 07:08:04,400
From going away

26304
07:08:04,400 --> 07:08:05,060
turned his back

26305
07:08:05,060 --> 07:08:05,480
with them

26306
07:08:05,480 --> 07:08:05,900
and entered

26307
07:08:05,900 --> 07:08:06,680
into conversation

26308
07:08:06,680 --> 07:08:07,860
with Mr. Gardner.

26309
07:08:07,860 --> 07:08:08,580
Elizabeth could

26310
07:08:08,580 --> 07:08:09,860
not but be pleased.

26311
07:08:09,980 --> 07:08:10,500
Could not.

26312
07:08:10,500 --> 07:08:11,640
But to triumph.

26313
07:08:11,640 --> 07:08:12,620
It was consoling

26314
07:08:12,620 --> 07:08:13,280
that he should know.

26315
07:08:13,280 --> 07:08:14,400
She had some relations

26316
07:08:14,400 --> 07:08:15,000
for whom there was.

26317
07:08:15,000 --> 07:08:16,200
No need to blush.

26318
07:08:16,500 --> 07:08:17,100
She listened

26319
07:08:17,100 --> 07:08:17,880
most attentively

26320
07:08:17,880 --> 07:08:18,620
to all that passed

26321
07:08:18,620 --> 07:08:20,000
between them and gloried

26322
07:08:20,000 --> 07:08:21,200
in every expression,

26323
07:08:21,260 --> 07:08:22,140
every sentence

26324
07:08:22,140 --> 07:08:22,920
of her uncle,

26325
07:08:22,920 --> 07:08:23,540
which marked

26326
07:08:23,540 --> 07:08:24,420
his intelligence

26327
07:08:24,420 --> 07:08:25,220
his taste

26328
07:08:25,220 --> 07:08:26,420
or his good manners.

26329
07:08:26,940 --> 07:08:27,980
The conversation soon

26330
07:08:27,980 --> 07:08:29,180
turned upon fishing,

26331
07:08:29,280 --> 07:08:30,080
and she heard Mr.

26332
07:08:30,080 --> 07:08:31,040
Darcy invite him

26333
07:08:31,040 --> 07:08:31,260
with the

26334
07:08:31,260 --> 07:08:32,420
greatest civility

26335
07:08:32,420 --> 07:08:32,880
to fish

26336
07:08:32,880 --> 07:08:33,540
there as often

26337
07:08:33,540 --> 07:08:34,220
as he chose,

26338
07:08:34,220 --> 07:08:34,820
while he continued

26339
07:08:34,820 --> 07:08:35,760
in the neighborhood,

26340
07:08:35,760 --> 07:08:36,320
offering at

26341
07:08:36,320 --> 07:08:36,920
the same time

26342
07:08:36,920 --> 07:08:37,500
to supply him

26343
07:08:37,500 --> 07:08:38,580
with fishing tackle

26344
07:08:38,580 --> 07:08:39,240
and pointing out

26345
07:08:39,240 --> 07:08:39,740
those parts

26346
07:08:39,740 --> 07:08:40,260
of the stream

26347
07:08:40,260 --> 07:08:40,880
where there was most

26348
07:08:40,880 --> 07:08:42,080
usually sport.

26349
07:08:42,320 --> 07:08:42,660
Mrs.

26350
07:08:42,660 --> 07:08:43,140
Gardiner,

26351
07:08:43,140 --> 07:08:43,700
who was walking

26352
07:08:43,700 --> 07:08:44,280
arm in arm

26353
07:08:44,280 --> 07:08:45,060
with Elizabeth,

26354
07:08:45,060 --> 07:08:45,840
gave her a look.

26355
07:08:45,840 --> 07:08:47,120
Expressive of wonder.

26356
07:08:47,600 --> 07:08:48,800
Elizabeth said nothing,

26357
07:08:48,840 --> 07:08:49,740
but it gratified her

26358
07:08:49,740 --> 07:08:50,540
exceedingly.

26359
07:08:50,540 --> 07:08:51,600
The compliment must be

26360
07:08:51,600 --> 07:08:52,800
all for herself.

26361
07:08:53,040 --> 07:08:54,080
Her astonishment

26362
07:08:54,080 --> 07:08:54,980
was extreme

26363
07:08:54,980 --> 07:08:55,820
and continually

26364
07:08:55,820 --> 07:08:57,020
was she repeating?

26365
07:08:57,140 --> 07:08:58,740
Why is he so altered

26366
07:08:59,040 --> 07:08:59,580
from what

26367
07:08:59,580 --> 07:09:00,780
cannot proceed?

26368
07:09:00,800 --> 07:09:02,100
It cannot be for me

26369
07:09:02,280 --> 07:09:03,120
at cannot be for.

26370
07:09:03,120 --> 07:09:04,340
My that his manners

26371
07:09:04,340 --> 07:09:04,680
and thus.

26372
07:09:04,680 --> 07:09:06,260
Softened my reproof

26373
07:09:06,260 --> 07:09:06,920
that Hansford

26374
07:09:06,920 --> 07:09:07,580
could not work

26375
07:09:07,580 --> 07:09:08,780
such a change as this.

26376
07:09:09,140 --> 07:09:10,040
It is impossible

26377
07:09:10,040 --> 07:09:10,380
that he should

26378
07:09:10,380 --> 07:09:11,580
still love me.

26379
07:09:11,660 --> 07:09:12,480
After walking

26380
07:09:12,480 --> 07:09:13,740
some time in this way.

26381
07:09:13,880 --> 07:09:15,120
The two ladies in front,

26382
07:09:15,120 --> 07:09:15,840
the two gentlemen

26383
07:09:15,840 --> 07:09:16,520
behind.

26384
07:09:16,520 --> 07:09:17,280
On resuming their.

26385
07:09:17,280 --> 07:09:17,900
Places

26386
07:09:17,900 --> 07:09:18,620
after descending

26387
07:09:18,620 --> 07:09:19,080
to the brink

26388
07:09:19,080 --> 07:09:19,500
of the river

26389
07:09:19,500 --> 07:09:19,700
for the

26390
07:09:19,700 --> 07:09:20,580
better inspection

26391
07:09:20,580 --> 07:09:20,900
of some

26392
07:09:20,900 --> 07:09:22,100
curious water plant.

26393
07:09:22,380 --> 07:09:23,120
Their chance

26394
07:09:23,120 --> 07:09:24,360
be a little alteration.

26395
07:09:24,720 --> 07:09:25,820
It originated in Mrs.

26396
07:09:25,820 --> 07:09:26,640
Gardner.

26397
07:09:26,640 --> 07:09:27,380
Who, fatigued.

26398
07:09:27,380 --> 07:09:28,200
By the exercise

26399
07:09:28,200 --> 07:09:28,980
of the morning,

26400
07:09:28,980 --> 07:09:30,060
found Elizabeth's arm

26401
07:09:30,060 --> 07:09:30,540
inadequate

26402
07:09:30,540 --> 07:09:31,460
to her support

26403
07:09:31,460 --> 07:09:32,340
and consequently

26404
07:09:32,340 --> 07:09:33,540
preferred husband's.

26405
07:09:33,860 --> 07:09:34,160
Mr.

26406
07:09:34,160 --> 07:09:34,860
Darcy took her

26407
07:09:34,860 --> 07:09:36,060
place by her knees,

26408
07:09:36,060 --> 07:09:36,740
and they walked

26409
07:09:36,740 --> 07:09:37,940
on together.

26410
07:09:38,000 --> 07:09:39,180
After a short silence,

26411
07:09:39,180 --> 07:09:40,440
the lady first spoke.

26412
07:09:40,860 --> 07:09:41,480
She wished him.

26413
07:09:41,480 --> 07:09:41,780
To know

26414
07:09:41,780 --> 07:09:42,120
that she had

26415
07:09:42,120 --> 07:09:43,340
been assured his absence

26416
07:09:43,340 --> 07:09:44,000
before she came

26417
07:09:44,000 --> 07:09:44,880
to the place,

26418
07:09:44,880 --> 07:09:45,960
and accordingly began

26419
07:09:45,960 --> 07:09:46,620
by observing

26420
07:09:46,620 --> 07:09:47,280
that his arrival

26421
07:09:47,280 --> 07:09:47,540
had been

26422
07:09:47,540 --> 07:09:48,740
very unexpected.

26423
07:09:49,200 --> 07:09:50,400
For your housekeeper.

26424
07:09:50,520 --> 07:09:52,260
She added, informed us

26425
07:09:52,260 --> 07:09:52,640
that she would

26426
07:09:52,640 --> 07:09:53,600
certainly not be here

26427
07:09:53,600 --> 07:09:54,780
till tomorrow.

26428
07:09:54,780 --> 07:09:55,520
And indeed,

26429
07:09:55,520 --> 07:09:56,720
before we left Bakewell,

26430
07:09:56,880 --> 07:09:57,620
we understood that

26431
07:09:57,620 --> 07:09:58,380
you were not immediately

26432
07:09:58,380 --> 07:09:59,660
expected in the country.

26433
07:10:00,320 --> 07:10:00,980
He acknowledged

26434
07:10:00,980 --> 07:10:01,920
the truth of it all

26435
07:10:01,920 --> 07:10:02,780
and, said that

26436
07:10:02,780 --> 07:10:03,420
business with

26437
07:10:03,420 --> 07:10:04,040
his steward

26438
07:10:04,040 --> 07:10:04,640
had occasioned

26439
07:10:04,640 --> 07:10:05,460
his coming forward

26440
07:10:05,460 --> 07:10:06,120
a few hours

26441
07:10:06,120 --> 07:10:06,720
before the rest

26442
07:10:06,720 --> 07:10:07,280
of the party

26443
07:10:07,280 --> 07:10:07,620
with whom

26444
07:10:07,620 --> 07:10:08,600
he had been traveling.

26445
07:10:08,600 --> 07:10:09,780
They will join me early

26446
07:10:09,780 --> 07:10:10,580
tomorrow.

26447
07:10:10,580 --> 07:10:11,780
He continued.

26448
07:10:11,960 --> 07:10:13,080
And among them are some

26449
07:10:13,080 --> 07:10:13,520
who will claim

26450
07:10:13,520 --> 07:10:14,060
an acquaintance

26451
07:10:14,060 --> 07:10:14,900
with you.

26452
07:10:14,900 --> 07:10:15,180
Mr.

26453
07:10:15,180 --> 07:10:16,220
Bingley and his sisters.

26454
07:10:17,180 --> 07:10:18,120
Elizabeth answered

26455
07:10:18,120 --> 07:10:19,340
only by a slight bow.

26456
07:10:19,620 --> 07:10:20,340
Her thoughts were

26457
07:10:20,340 --> 07:10:21,080
instantly driven

26458
07:10:21,080 --> 07:10:21,960
back to the time

26459
07:10:21,960 --> 07:10:22,320
when Mr.

26460
07:10:22,320 --> 07:10:22,620
Bingley,

26461
07:10:22,620 --> 07:10:23,060
his name,

26462
07:10:23,060 --> 07:10:23,360
had been

26463
07:10:23,360 --> 07:10:24,240
the last mention

26464
07:10:24,240 --> 07:10:25,220
between them.

26465
07:10:25,220 --> 07:10:26,220
And if she might judge.

26466
07:10:26,220 --> 07:10:27,380
By his complexion,

26467
07:10:27,380 --> 07:10:28,400
his mind was not

26468
07:10:28,400 --> 07:10:28,980
very differently

26469
07:10:28,980 --> 07:10:30,180
engaged.

26470
07:10:30,600 --> 07:10:31,860
There is also one person

26471
07:10:31,860 --> 07:10:33,060
in the party.

26472
07:10:33,180 --> 07:10:33,720
He continued

26473
07:10:33,720 --> 07:10:34,920
after a pause.

26474
07:10:35,240 --> 07:10:36,080
Who more particularly

26475
07:10:36,080 --> 07:10:36,380
wishes

26476
07:10:36,380 --> 07:10:37,580
to be known to you.

26477
07:10:37,620 --> 07:10:38,480
Will you allow me,

26478
07:10:38,480 --> 07:10:39,680
or do I ask too much

26479
07:10:39,860 --> 07:10:40,860
to introduce my sister

26480
07:10:40,860 --> 07:10:41,600
to acquaintance

26481
07:10:41,600 --> 07:10:42,200
during your stay

26482
07:10:42,200 --> 07:10:43,400
at Lambton?

26483
07:10:44,240 --> 07:10:45,260
The surprise of such

26484
07:10:45,260 --> 07:10:45,980
an application

26485
07:10:45,980 --> 07:10:47,180
was great indeed.

26486
07:10:47,220 --> 07:10:47,840
It was too.

26487
07:10:47,840 --> 07:10:48,740
Great for her to know

26488
07:10:48,740 --> 07:10:49,380
in what manner

26489
07:10:49,380 --> 07:10:50,580
she acceded to it.

26490
07:10:50,720 --> 07:10:51,560
She immediately felt

26491
07:10:51,560 --> 07:10:51,980
that whatever

26492
07:10:51,980 --> 07:10:52,500
desire Ms..

26493
07:10:52,500 --> 07:10:52,880
Darcy

26494
07:10:52,880 --> 07:10:53,340
might have of

26495
07:10:53,340 --> 07:10:53,940
being acquainted

26496
07:10:53,940 --> 07:10:54,240
with her

26497
07:10:54,240 --> 07:10:54,920
must be the work

26498
07:10:54,920 --> 07:10:55,820
of her brother.

26499
07:10:55,820 --> 07:10:56,300
And without

26500
07:10:56,300 --> 07:10:57,260
looking farther,

26501
07:10:57,260 --> 07:10:58,460
it was satisfactory.

26502
07:10:58,620 --> 07:10:59,520
It was gratifying

26503
07:10:59,520 --> 07:10:59,780
to know

26504
07:10:59,780 --> 07:11:00,660
that his resentment

26505
07:11:00,660 --> 07:11:01,220
not made him

26506
07:11:01,220 --> 07:11:02,460
think really ill of her.

26507
07:11:03,440 --> 07:11:04,160
They now walked.

26508
07:11:04,160 --> 07:11:05,180
On in silence,

26509
07:11:05,180 --> 07:11:05,780
each of them

26510
07:11:05,780 --> 07:11:06,980
deep in thought.

26511
07:11:07,140 --> 07:11:07,800
Elizabeth was

26512
07:11:07,800 --> 07:11:08,840
not comfortable.

26513
07:11:08,840 --> 07:11:10,040
That was impossible.

26514
07:11:10,040 --> 07:11:11,040
But she was flattered

26515
07:11:11,040 --> 07:11:12,120
and pleased.

26516
07:11:12,120 --> 07:11:13,260
His wish of introducing

26517
07:11:13,260 --> 07:11:14,000
his sister to her

26518
07:11:14,000 --> 07:11:14,700
was a compliment

26519
07:11:14,700 --> 07:11:15,900
of the highest kind.

26520
07:11:16,280 --> 07:11:16,800
They soon.

26521
07:11:16,800 --> 07:11:18,000
Outstripped the others.

26522
07:11:18,080 --> 07:11:18,540
And when they

26523
07:11:18,540 --> 07:11:18,860
had reached

26524
07:11:18,860 --> 07:11:19,640
the carriage.

26525
07:11:19,640 --> 07:11:20,480
Mr. and Mrs.

26526
07:11:20,480 --> 07:11:21,320
Gardiner were half

26527
07:11:21,320 --> 07:11:22,080
a quarter of a mile.

26528
07:11:22,080 --> 07:11:23,120
Behind.

26529
07:11:23,120 --> 07:11:23,960
He then asked her to

26530
07:11:23,960 --> 07:11:24,320
walk into

26531
07:11:24,320 --> 07:11:25,260
the house, but.

26532
07:11:25,260 --> 07:11:26,120
She declared herself

26533
07:11:26,120 --> 07:11:27,060
not tired,

26534
07:11:27,060 --> 07:11:27,660
and they stood

26535
07:11:27,660 --> 07:11:28,860
together on the lawn.

26536
07:11:28,940 --> 07:11:30,140
At such a time

26537
07:11:30,180 --> 07:11:30,620
might have been.

26538
07:11:30,620 --> 07:11:31,940
Said and silence

26539
07:11:31,940 --> 07:11:33,140
was very awkward.

26540
07:11:33,260 --> 07:11:34,460
She wanted to talk.

26541
07:11:34,560 --> 07:11:35,100
But there seemed

26542
07:11:35,100 --> 07:11:35,840
to be an embargo

26543
07:11:35,840 --> 07:11:36,180
on every.

26544
07:11:36,180 --> 07:11:37,200
Subject.

26545
07:11:37,200 --> 07:11:38,540
At last, she recollected

26546
07:11:38,540 --> 07:11:38,880
that she had

26547
07:11:38,880 --> 07:11:39,800
been traveling,

26548
07:11:39,800 --> 07:11:40,440
and they talked

26549
07:11:40,440 --> 07:11:41,840
of Matlock and Dovedale

26550
07:11:41,840 --> 07:11:43,040
with great perseverance.

26551
07:11:43,560 --> 07:11:44,340
Yet Time

26552
07:11:44,340 --> 07:11:44,580
and her

26553
07:11:44,580 --> 07:11:45,780
aunt moved slowly,

26554
07:11:46,040 --> 07:11:46,860
and her patience

26555
07:11:46,860 --> 07:11:47,540
and her ideas

26556
07:11:47,540 --> 07:11:48,740
were nearly worn out

26557
07:11:48,780 --> 07:11:50,360
before the Ted was over.

26558
07:11:50,780 --> 07:11:51,380
After Mr.

26559
07:11:51,380 --> 07:11:51,780
and Mrs.

26560
07:11:51,780 --> 07:11:52,760
Gardner's coming up,

26561
07:11:52,760 --> 07:11:53,540
they were all pressed

26562
07:11:53,540 --> 07:11:54,360
to go into the house

26563
07:11:54,360 --> 07:11:54,680
and take

26564
07:11:54,680 --> 07:11:55,760
some refreshment,

26565
07:11:55,760 --> 07:11:56,960
but this was declined

26566
07:11:57,060 --> 07:11:57,840
and they parted on

26567
07:11:57,840 --> 07:11:59,100
each side with utmost.

26568
07:12:00,260 --> 07:12:00,620
Mr.

26569
07:12:00,620 --> 07:12:01,460
Darcy handed the

26570
07:12:01,460 --> 07:12:01,800
ladies

26571
07:12:01,800 --> 07:12:02,700
into the carriage,

26572
07:12:02,700 --> 07:12:03,900
and when it drove off,

26573
07:12:03,960 --> 07:12:04,440
Elizabeth

26574
07:12:04,440 --> 07:12:04,820
saw him

26575
07:12:04,820 --> 07:12:06,020
walking slowly towards

26576
07:12:06,020 --> 07:12:07,220
the house.

26577
07:12:07,520 --> 07:12:08,480
The observations

26578
07:12:08,480 --> 07:12:08,960
of her uncle

26579
07:12:08,960 --> 07:12:10,160
and aunt now began,

26580
07:12:10,260 --> 07:12:10,980
and each of them

26581
07:12:10,980 --> 07:12:11,520
pronounced him

26582
07:12:11,520 --> 07:12:11,760
to be

26583
07:12:11,760 --> 07:12:12,840
infinitely superior

26584
07:12:12,840 --> 07:12:13,380
to anything

26585
07:12:13,380 --> 07:12:14,580
they had expected.

26586
07:12:14,580 --> 07:12:15,200
He is perfectly

26587
07:12:15,200 --> 07:12:16,520
well behaved, polite

26588
07:12:16,520 --> 07:12:17,640
and unassuming.

26589
07:12:17,640 --> 07:12:18,720
Said her uncle.

26590
07:12:18,720 --> 07:12:19,580
There is something

26591
07:12:19,580 --> 07:12:20,540
a little stately in him,

26592
07:12:20,540 --> 07:12:21,480
to be sure.

26593
07:12:21,480 --> 07:12:22,680
Replied her aunt.

26594
07:12:22,820 --> 07:12:23,900
But it is confined

26595
07:12:23,900 --> 07:12:25,100
to his air and

26596
07:12:25,100 --> 07:12:26,300
is not unbecoming.

26597
07:12:26,460 --> 07:12:27,300
I can now

26598
07:12:27,300 --> 07:12:28,500
say with the housekeeper

26599
07:12:28,620 --> 07:12:29,000
that, though

26600
07:12:29,000 --> 07:12:29,640
some people may

26601
07:12:29,640 --> 07:12:30,500
call him proud,

26602
07:12:30,500 --> 07:12:30,960
I have seen

26603
07:12:30,960 --> 07:12:32,160
nothing of it.

26604
07:12:32,540 --> 07:12:33,180
I was never

26605
07:12:33,180 --> 07:12:33,780
more surprised

26606
07:12:33,780 --> 07:12:34,620
than by his behavior.

26607
07:12:34,620 --> 07:12:35,280
To us

26608
07:12:35,280 --> 07:12:36,500
it was more than civil.

26609
07:12:36,660 --> 07:12:37,880
It was really attentive

26610
07:12:38,040 --> 07:12:38,220
and.

26611
07:12:38,220 --> 07:12:39,200
There was no necessity

26612
07:12:39,200 --> 07:12:40,340
for such attention.

26613
07:12:40,340 --> 07:12:41,040
His acquaintance

26614
07:12:41,040 --> 07:12:41,600
with Elizabeth

26615
07:12:41,600 --> 07:12:42,800
was very trifling.

26616
07:12:43,400 --> 07:12:44,600
To be sure, Lizzie.

26617
07:12:44,720 --> 07:12:45,680
Said her aunt.

26618
07:12:45,680 --> 07:12:46,880
He is not so handsome

26619
07:12:46,880 --> 07:12:47,880
as Wickham or.

26620
07:12:47,880 --> 07:12:48,260
Rather,

26621
07:12:48,260 --> 07:12:48,800
he has not

26622
07:12:48,800 --> 07:12:49,760
Wickham's countenance

26623
07:12:49,760 --> 07:12:50,400
for his speech

26624
07:12:50,400 --> 07:12:51,600
as a perfectly good.

26625
07:12:51,960 --> 07:12:52,620
But how came.

26626
07:12:52,620 --> 07:12:53,160
You to tell me

26627
07:12:53,160 --> 07:12:53,600
that he was so.

26628
07:12:53,600 --> 07:12:54,800
Disagreeable?

26629
07:12:55,140 --> 07:12:55,640
Elizabeth

26630
07:12:55,640 --> 07:12:56,420
excused herself

26631
07:12:56,420 --> 07:12:56,900
as well as she.

26632
07:12:56,900 --> 07:12:57,500
Could.

26633
07:12:57,500 --> 07:12:58,140
Said she had

26634
07:12:58,140 --> 07:12:58,860
liked him better

26635
07:12:58,860 --> 07:12:59,480
when they had met in

26636
07:12:59,480 --> 07:13:00,680
Kent than before,

26637
07:13:00,720 --> 07:13:01,320
and that she had

26638
07:13:01,320 --> 07:13:01,880
never seen him

26639
07:13:01,880 --> 07:13:02,540
so pleasant

26640
07:13:02,540 --> 07:13:03,740
as this morning.

26641
07:13:03,900 --> 07:13:04,880
But perhaps he may be

26642
07:13:04,880 --> 07:13:05,700
a little whimsical

26643
07:13:05,700 --> 07:13:06,900
in his civilities.

26644
07:13:07,080 --> 07:13:08,280
Replied her Uncle.

26645
07:13:08,340 --> 07:13:09,020
Your great man

26646
07:13:09,020 --> 07:13:09,900
of an hour,

26647
07:13:09,900 --> 07:13:10,400
and therefore

26648
07:13:10,400 --> 07:13:10,800
I shall not

26649
07:13:10,800 --> 07:13:11,600
take him at his word

26650
07:13:11,600 --> 07:13:12,540
about fishing

26651
07:13:12,540 --> 07:13:13,040
as he might

26652
07:13:13,040 --> 07:13:13,800
change his mind

26653
07:13:13,800 --> 07:13:15,240
another day and warn me

26654
07:13:15,240 --> 07:13:16,440
of his grounds.

26655
07:13:16,560 --> 07:13:17,400
Elizabeth felt

26656
07:13:17,400 --> 07:13:17,760
that they had

26657
07:13:17,760 --> 07:13:18,860
entirely misunderstood

26658
07:13:18,860 --> 07:13:19,580
his character,

26659
07:13:19,580 --> 07:13:20,780
but said nothing.

26660
07:13:21,180 --> 07:13:21,800
From what we have

26661
07:13:21,800 --> 07:13:22,640
seen of him.

26662
07:13:22,640 --> 07:13:23,300
Continued Mrs..

26663
07:13:23,300 --> 07:13:24,120
Gardiner.

26664
07:13:24,120 --> 07:13:24,800
I really should not

26665
07:13:24,800 --> 07:13:25,260
have thought

26666
07:13:25,260 --> 07:13:25,640
that he could have.

26667
07:13:25,640 --> 07:13:26,640
Behaved in so cruel

26668
07:13:26,640 --> 07:13:27,740
a way by as.

26669
07:13:27,740 --> 07:13:28,160
He has done

26670
07:13:28,160 --> 07:13:29,280
by poor Wickham.

26671
07:13:29,280 --> 07:13:29,820
He has not an

26672
07:13:29,820 --> 07:13:31,020
ill natured look.

26673
07:13:31,320 --> 07:13:32,120
On the contrary,

26674
07:13:32,120 --> 07:13:32,660
there is something

26675
07:13:32,660 --> 07:13:33,680
pleasing about his mouth

26676
07:13:33,680 --> 07:13:34,760
when he speaks.

26677
07:13:34,760 --> 07:13:35,120
And there is

26678
07:13:35,120 --> 07:13:36,020
something of dignity

26679
07:13:36,020 --> 07:13:36,920
in his countenance.

26680
07:13:36,920 --> 07:13:37,620
Would not give one

26681
07:13:37,620 --> 07:13:38,600
an unfavorable idea

26682
07:13:38,600 --> 07:13:39,800
of his heart.

26683
07:13:39,840 --> 07:13:40,740
But to be sure,

26684
07:13:40,740 --> 07:13:41,300
the good lady

26685
07:13:41,300 --> 07:13:41,720
who showed us

26686
07:13:41,720 --> 07:13:42,180
his house

26687
07:13:42,180 --> 07:13:42,920
did give him a most

26688
07:13:42,920 --> 07:13:44,120
flaming character.

26689
07:13:44,360 --> 07:13:44,660
I could

26690
07:13:44,660 --> 07:13:45,180
hardly have

26691
07:13:45,180 --> 07:13:45,960
laughing aloud.

26692
07:13:45,960 --> 07:13:47,160
Sometimes but

26693
07:13:47,160 --> 07:13:48,480
he is a liberal master,

26694
07:13:48,480 --> 07:13:49,220
I suppose,

26695
07:13:49,220 --> 07:13:50,180
and that in the eye of

26696
07:13:50,180 --> 07:13:50,640
a servant

26697
07:13:50,640 --> 07:13:51,180
comprehends

26698
07:13:51,180 --> 07:13:52,100
every virtue.

26699
07:13:53,300 --> 07:13:53,880
Elizabeth

26700
07:13:53,880 --> 07:13:54,740
here felt herself

26701
07:13:54,740 --> 07:13:55,280
called on to

26702
07:13:55,280 --> 07:13:55,820
say something

26703
07:13:55,820 --> 07:13:56,540
in vindication

26704
07:13:56,540 --> 07:13:57,180
of his behavior

26705
07:13:57,180 --> 07:13:57,960
to Wickham,

26706
07:13:57,960 --> 07:13:58,920
and therefore gave them

26707
07:13:58,920 --> 07:13:59,820
to understand

26708
07:13:59,820 --> 07:14:00,480
in as guarded

26709
07:14:00,480 --> 07:14:01,080
a manner as she.

26710
07:14:01,080 --> 07:14:02,580
Could that by what she.

26711
07:14:02,580 --> 07:14:02,880
Had heard

26712
07:14:02,880 --> 07:14:03,600
from his relations

26713
07:14:03,600 --> 07:14:04,340
in Kent.

26714
07:14:04,340 --> 07:14:05,540
His actions were capable

26715
07:14:05,540 --> 07:14:06,740
of a very different

26716
07:14:07,280 --> 07:14:08,160
and that his character

26717
07:14:08,160 --> 07:14:08,420
was by

26718
07:14:08,420 --> 07:14:09,660
no means so faulty,

26719
07:14:09,840 --> 07:14:10,520
nor Wickham's

26720
07:14:10,520 --> 07:14:11,240
so amiable

26721
07:14:11,240 --> 07:14:11,600
as they had

26722
07:14:11,600 --> 07:14:12,200
been considered

26723
07:14:12,200 --> 07:14:13,400
in Hertfordshire.

26724
07:14:13,460 --> 07:14:14,760
In confirmation of this,

26725
07:14:14,780 --> 07:14:15,380
she related

26726
07:14:15,380 --> 07:14:16,140
the particulars

26727
07:14:16,140 --> 07:14:16,400
all the

26728
07:14:16,400 --> 07:14:17,760
pecuniary transactions

26729
07:14:17,760 --> 07:14:18,060
in which

26730
07:14:18,060 --> 07:14:19,140
they had been connected

26731
07:14:19,140 --> 07:14:19,980
without actually

26732
07:14:19,980 --> 07:14:21,180
naming her authority,

26733
07:14:21,260 --> 07:14:21,900
but stating it

26734
07:14:21,900 --> 07:14:22,100
to be

26735
07:14:22,100 --> 07:14:22,800
such as might

26736
07:14:22,800 --> 07:14:24,000
be relied on.

26737
07:14:24,240 --> 07:14:24,560
Mrs.

26738
07:14:24,560 --> 07:14:25,740
Gardiner was surprised

26739
07:14:25,740 --> 07:14:26,780
and concerned.

26740
07:14:26,780 --> 07:14:27,320
But as they were

26741
07:14:27,320 --> 07:14:27,920
now approaching

26742
07:14:27,920 --> 07:14:28,220
the scene

26743
07:14:28,220 --> 07:14:29,420
of her former pleasures.

26744
07:14:29,480 --> 07:14:29,880
Every.

26745
07:14:29,880 --> 07:14:30,660
Idea gave way

26746
07:14:30,660 --> 07:14:31,160
to the charm

26747
07:14:31,160 --> 07:14:32,240
of recollection,

26748
07:14:32,240 --> 07:14:33,000
and she was too

26749
07:14:33,000 --> 07:14:33,720
much engaged

26750
07:14:33,720 --> 07:14:34,320
in pointing out

26751
07:14:34,320 --> 07:14:35,000
to her husband

26752
07:14:35,000 --> 07:14:36,180
all the interesting

26753
07:14:36,180 --> 07:14:36,980
and its environs

26754
07:14:36,980 --> 07:14:37,380
to think of

26755
07:14:37,380 --> 07:14:38,580
anything else.

26756
07:14:38,660 --> 07:14:39,480
Fatigued as she had

26757
07:14:39,480 --> 07:14:40,260
been by the morning's

26758
07:14:40,260 --> 07:14:40,820
walk.

26759
07:14:40,820 --> 07:14:41,300
They had no.

26760
07:14:41,300 --> 07:14:42,000
Sooner dined

26761
07:14:42,000 --> 07:14:42,900
than she set off again

26762
07:14:42,900 --> 07:14:43,460
in quest of her

26763
07:14:43,460 --> 07:14:44,600
former acquaintance,

26764
07:14:44,600 --> 07:14:45,200
and the evening

26765
07:14:45,200 --> 07:14:45,620
was spent

26766
07:14:45,620 --> 07:14:46,560
in the satisfactions

26767
07:14:46,560 --> 07:14:47,220
of an intercourse

26768
07:14:47,220 --> 07:14:48,500
renewed after many years

26769
07:14:48,500 --> 07:14:49,700
discontinuance.

26770
07:14:50,060 --> 07:14:50,780
The occurrences

26771
07:14:50,780 --> 07:14:51,240
of the day

26772
07:14:51,240 --> 07:14:51,800
were too full

26773
07:14:51,800 --> 07:14:52,320
of interest

26774
07:14:52,320 --> 07:14:52,640
to leave

26775
07:14:52,640 --> 07:14:53,720
Elizabeth much attention

26776
07:14:53,720 --> 07:14:54,440
for any of these

26777
07:14:54,440 --> 07:14:55,280
new friends.

26778
07:14:55,280 --> 07:14:55,700
And she could.

26779
07:14:55,700 --> 07:14:56,900
Do nothing but think

26780
07:14:56,940 --> 07:14:58,140
and think with wonder

26781
07:14:58,280 --> 07:14:58,760
of Mr.

26782
07:14:58,760 --> 07:14:59,960
Darcy's civility

26783
07:15:00,080 --> 07:15:01,620
and above all of his

26784
07:15:01,620 --> 07:15:02,300
wishing her to be

26785
07:15:02,300 --> 07:15:03,180
acquainted with

26786
07:15:03,180 --> 07:15:03,780
his sister.

26787
07:15:05,280 --> 07:15:06,480
Chapter 44.

26788
07:15:07,920 --> 07:15:08,460
Elizabeth

26789
07:15:08,460 --> 07:15:09,720
had settled it that Mr.

26790
07:15:09,720 --> 07:15:10,280
Darcy would

26791
07:15:10,280 --> 07:15:11,000
bring his sister

26792
07:15:11,000 --> 07:15:11,640
to visit her

26793
07:15:11,640 --> 07:15:12,420
the very day

26794
07:15:12,420 --> 07:15:12,800
after her

26795
07:15:12,800 --> 07:15:14,000
reaching Pemberley,

26796
07:15:14,000 --> 07:15:15,000
and was consequently

26797
07:15:15,000 --> 07:15:15,600
resolved

26798
07:15:15,600 --> 07:15:16,580
not to be out of sight

26799
07:15:16,580 --> 07:15:16,800
of the

26800
07:15:16,800 --> 07:15:17,700
in the whole

26801
07:15:17,700 --> 07:15:18,900
of that morning.

26802
07:15:19,020 --> 07:15:20,000
But her conclusion

26803
07:15:20,000 --> 07:15:20,940
was false.

26804
07:15:20,940 --> 07:15:22,020
For on the very morning

26805
07:15:22,020 --> 07:15:22,940
after their arrival

26806
07:15:22,940 --> 07:15:23,820
at Lambton,

26807
07:15:23,820 --> 07:15:25,040
these visitors came.

26808
07:15:25,520 --> 07:15:26,360
They had been walking

26809
07:15:26,360 --> 07:15:27,000
about the place

26810
07:15:27,000 --> 07:15:27,440
with some of

26811
07:15:27,440 --> 07:15:28,400
their new friends

26812
07:15:28,400 --> 07:15:29,400
and were just returning

26813
07:15:29,400 --> 07:15:29,880
to the end

26814
07:15:29,880 --> 07:15:30,720
to dress themselves

26815
07:15:30,720 --> 07:15:31,280
for dining

26816
07:15:31,280 --> 07:15:32,480
with the same family

26817
07:15:32,540 --> 07:15:33,140
when the sound

26818
07:15:33,140 --> 07:15:33,800
of a carriage

26819
07:15:33,800 --> 07:15:35,000
drew them to the window

26820
07:15:35,100 --> 07:15:36,380
and they saw a gentleman

26821
07:15:36,380 --> 07:15:37,580
and a lady in a car

26822
07:15:37,620 --> 07:15:38,820
driving up the street.

26823
07:15:39,180 --> 07:15:40,220
Elizabeth, immediately

26824
07:15:40,220 --> 07:15:41,420
recognizing the livery.

26825
07:15:41,600 --> 07:15:42,800
Guessed what it meant.

26826
07:15:42,960 --> 07:15:43,700
And imparted

26827
07:15:43,700 --> 07:15:44,640
no small degree

26828
07:15:44,640 --> 07:15:45,440
of her surprise

26829
07:15:45,440 --> 07:15:46,560
to her relations.

26830
07:15:46,560 --> 07:15:47,280
By acquainting.

26831
07:15:47,280 --> 07:15:48,120
Them with the honor

26832
07:15:48,120 --> 07:15:49,320
which she expected.

26833
07:15:49,680 --> 07:15:50,220
Her uncle

26834
07:15:50,220 --> 07:15:50,700
and aunt

26835
07:15:50,700 --> 07:15:51,860
were all amazement

26836
07:15:51,860 --> 07:15:52,920
and the embarrassment

26837
07:15:52,920 --> 07:15:53,520
of her matter

26838
07:15:53,520 --> 07:15:54,480
as she spoke.

26839
07:15:54,480 --> 07:15:55,080
Joined to the

26840
07:15:55,080 --> 07:15:56,280
circumstance itself

26841
07:15:56,420 --> 07:15:57,000
and many of

26842
07:15:57,000 --> 07:15:57,840
the circumstances

26843
07:15:57,840 --> 07:15:59,040
of the preceding day

26844
07:15:59,220 --> 07:16:00,900
opens to them a new idea

26845
07:16:00,900 --> 07:16:02,100
on the business.

26846
07:16:02,160 --> 07:16:03,060
Nothing had ever

26847
07:16:03,060 --> 07:16:04,280
suggested it before,

26848
07:16:04,580 --> 07:16:05,300
but they felt that

26849
07:16:05,300 --> 07:16:06,180
there was no other way

26850
07:16:06,180 --> 07:16:06,780
of accounting

26851
07:16:06,780 --> 07:16:07,640
for such attentions

26852
07:16:07,640 --> 07:16:08,780
from such a quarter

26853
07:16:08,780 --> 07:16:09,800
than by supposing

26854
07:16:09,800 --> 07:16:10,740
a partiality

26855
07:16:10,740 --> 07:16:11,940
for their niece.

26856
07:16:11,940 --> 07:16:13,080
While these newly born

26857
07:16:13,080 --> 07:16:14,160
notions were passing

26858
07:16:14,160 --> 07:16:14,960
their heads,

26859
07:16:14,960 --> 07:16:15,840
the perturbation

26860
07:16:15,840 --> 07:16:16,940
of Elizabeth's feelings

26861
07:16:16,940 --> 07:16:17,520
was at every

26862
07:16:17,520 --> 07:16:18,720
moment increasing.

26863
07:16:19,040 --> 07:16:20,360
She was quite amazed.

26864
07:16:20,360 --> 07:16:20,820
At her own

26865
07:16:20,820 --> 07:16:22,020
dis composure.

26866
07:16:22,020 --> 07:16:22,860
But amongst other

26867
07:16:22,860 --> 07:16:24,060
causes of disquiet,

26868
07:16:24,240 --> 07:16:25,260
she dreaded, lest

26869
07:16:25,260 --> 07:16:26,120
the partiality

26870
07:16:26,120 --> 07:16:26,720
of the brother

26871
07:16:26,720 --> 07:16:27,300
should have said

26872
07:16:27,300 --> 07:16:28,580
too much in her favor

26873
07:16:28,800 --> 07:16:29,900
and more than commonly

26874
07:16:29,900 --> 07:16:31,100
anxious to please.

26875
07:16:31,200 --> 07:16:32,520
She naturally suspected

26876
07:16:32,520 --> 07:16:33,360
that every power

26877
07:16:33,360 --> 07:16:34,800
of pleasing fail her.

26878
07:16:35,220 --> 07:16:35,960
She retreated

26879
07:16:35,960 --> 07:16:36,780
from the window,

26880
07:16:36,780 --> 07:16:37,700
fearful of being.

26881
07:16:37,700 --> 07:16:38,780
Seen, and as.

26882
07:16:38,780 --> 07:16:39,560
She walked up

26883
07:16:39,560 --> 07:16:40,380
and down the room

26884
07:16:40,380 --> 07:16:41,460
endeavoring to compose

26885
07:16:41,460 --> 07:16:42,900
herself, saw such

26886
07:16:42,900 --> 07:16:43,320
looks of

26887
07:16:43,320 --> 07:16:44,520
inquiring surprise

26888
07:16:44,520 --> 07:16:45,020
in her uncle

26889
07:16:45,020 --> 07:16:45,720
and aunt as

26890
07:16:45,720 --> 07:16:46,920
made everything worse.

26891
07:16:47,660 --> 07:16:48,420
Miss Darcy

26892
07:16:48,420 --> 07:16:48,620
and her

26893
07:16:48,620 --> 07:16:49,700
brother appeared,

26894
07:16:49,700 --> 07:16:50,820
and this formidable

26895
07:16:50,820 --> 07:16:52,260
introduction took place

26896
07:16:52,760 --> 07:16:53,900
with astonishment

26897
07:16:53,900 --> 07:16:54,440
at Elizabeth.

26898
07:16:54,440 --> 07:16:55,140
See that her new

26899
07:16:55,140 --> 07:16:55,820
acquaintance was

26900
07:16:55,820 --> 07:16:56,300
at least

26901
07:16:56,300 --> 07:16:57,180
as much embarrassed

26902
07:16:57,180 --> 07:16:58,380
as herself

26903
07:16:58,380 --> 07:16:59,180
since her being

26904
07:16:59,180 --> 07:17:00,080
at Lambton.

26905
07:17:00,080 --> 07:17:00,840
She had heard that

26906
07:17:00,840 --> 07:17:01,440
Miss Darcy

26907
07:17:01,440 --> 07:17:02,660
was exceedingly proud.

26908
07:17:02,960 --> 07:17:03,960
But the observation

26909
07:17:03,960 --> 07:17:04,980
of a very few minutes

26910
07:17:04,980 --> 07:17:05,520
convinced her

26911
07:17:05,520 --> 07:17:06,260
that she was only

26912
07:17:06,260 --> 07:17:07,460
exceedingly shy.

26913
07:17:07,820 --> 07:17:09,060
She found it difficult

26914
07:17:09,060 --> 07:17:09,660
to obtain

26915
07:17:09,660 --> 07:17:10,700
even a word from her

26916
07:17:10,700 --> 07:17:12,080
beyond a mono syllable.

26917
07:17:13,140 --> 07:17:13,400
Mr.

26918
07:17:13,400 --> 07:17:14,700
Darcy was tall and

26919
07:17:14,720 --> 07:17:15,260
on a larger

26920
07:17:15,260 --> 07:17:16,460
scale than Elizabeth,

26921
07:17:16,580 --> 07:17:17,040
and though

26922
07:17:17,040 --> 07:17:18,420
little more than 16,

26923
07:17:18,600 --> 07:17:19,860
her figure was formed

26924
07:17:19,860 --> 07:17:20,160
and her

26925
07:17:20,160 --> 07:17:21,200
appearance womanly

26926
07:17:21,200 --> 07:17:22,400
and graceful.

26927
07:17:22,400 --> 07:17:23,060
She was less

26928
07:17:23,060 --> 07:17:23,660
handsome than

26929
07:17:23,660 --> 07:17:24,320
her brother.

26930
07:17:24,320 --> 07:17:25,220
But there was sense

26931
07:17:25,220 --> 07:17:26,000
and good humor

26932
07:17:26,000 --> 07:17:26,900
in her face,

26933
07:17:26,900 --> 07:17:27,780
and her manners were

26934
07:17:27,780 --> 07:17:29,040
perfectly unassuming

26935
07:17:29,040 --> 07:17:30,240
and gentle.

26936
07:17:30,380 --> 07:17:31,100
Elizabeth, who

26937
07:17:31,100 --> 07:17:31,820
had expected

26938
07:17:31,820 --> 07:17:33,180
to find in her as acute

26939
07:17:33,320 --> 07:17:33,980
unembarrassed

26940
07:17:33,980 --> 07:17:35,220
an observer as ever Mr.

26941
07:17:35,220 --> 07:17:36,300
Darcy had been,

26942
07:17:36,300 --> 07:17:37,200
was much relieved

26943
07:17:37,200 --> 07:17:37,800
by discerning

26944
07:17:37,800 --> 07:17:39,060
such different feelings.

26945
07:17:39,720 --> 07:17:40,580
They had not long

26946
07:17:40,580 --> 07:17:41,420
been together before.

26947
07:17:41,420 --> 07:17:41,700
Mr.

26948
07:17:41,700 --> 07:17:42,500
Darcy told her

26949
07:17:42,500 --> 07:17:43,140
that Bingley

26950
07:17:43,140 --> 07:17:43,620
was also

26951
07:17:43,620 --> 07:17:44,820
coming to wait on her,

26952
07:17:44,940 --> 07:17:46,140
and she had barely time

26953
07:17:46,140 --> 07:17:46,680
to express

26954
07:17:46,680 --> 07:17:47,820
her satisfaction

26955
07:17:47,820 --> 07:17:48,560
and prepare

26956
07:17:48,560 --> 07:17:49,740
for such a visitor.

26957
07:17:49,740 --> 07:17:51,140
When Begley's quick step

26958
07:17:51,140 --> 07:17:52,340
was heard on the stairs

26959
07:17:52,500 --> 07:17:53,360
and in a moment

26960
07:17:53,360 --> 07:17:54,560
he entered the room.

26961
07:17:54,920 --> 07:17:56,180
All Elizabeth's anger

26962
07:17:56,180 --> 07:17:56,780
against him

26963
07:17:56,780 --> 07:17:58,080
had been long done away.

26964
07:17:58,380 --> 07:17:59,280
But had she still

26965
07:17:59,280 --> 07:18:00,080
felt any,

26966
07:18:00,080 --> 07:18:00,440
it could

26967
07:18:00,440 --> 07:18:01,100
hardly have stood

26968
07:18:01,100 --> 07:18:01,760
its ground

26969
07:18:01,760 --> 07:18:02,180
against the

26970
07:18:02,180 --> 07:18:03,600
unaffected cordiality

26971
07:18:03,600 --> 07:18:03,960
with which

26972
07:18:03,960 --> 07:18:05,180
he expressed himself on

26973
07:18:05,180 --> 07:18:06,380
seeing her again.

26974
07:18:06,600 --> 07:18:07,320
He inquired

26975
07:18:07,320 --> 07:18:08,400
in a friendly, though

26976
07:18:08,400 --> 07:18:09,200
general way,

26977
07:18:09,200 --> 07:18:10,340
after her family,

26978
07:18:10,340 --> 07:18:11,660
and looked and spoke

26979
07:18:11,660 --> 07:18:11,840
with the

26980
07:18:11,840 --> 07:18:13,200
same good humored ease

26981
07:18:13,200 --> 07:18:14,400
that he had ever done

26982
07:18:14,880 --> 07:18:15,480
to Mr.

26983
07:18:15,480 --> 07:18:16,400
and Mrs. Gardiner.

26984
07:18:16,400 --> 07:18:17,700
He was scarcely a less

26985
07:18:17,700 --> 07:18:18,680
interesting personage

26986
07:18:18,680 --> 07:18:19,880
than to herself.

26987
07:18:19,880 --> 07:18:20,940
They had long wished.

26988
07:18:20,940 --> 07:18:21,900
To see him.

26989
07:18:21,900 --> 07:18:22,640
The whole

26990
07:18:22,640 --> 07:18:23,520
before them, indeed

26991
07:18:23,520 --> 07:18:23,900
excited

26992
07:18:23,900 --> 07:18:25,100
a lively attention.

26993
07:18:25,220 --> 07:18:26,040
The suspicions,

26994
07:18:26,040 --> 07:18:26,940
which had just arisen

26995
07:18:26,940 --> 07:18:27,300
of Mr.

26996
07:18:27,300 --> 07:18:28,500
Darcy and their niece,

26997
07:18:28,520 --> 07:18:29,000
directed

26998
07:18:29,000 --> 07:18:29,820
their observation

26999
07:18:29,820 --> 07:18:30,620
towards each

27000
07:18:30,620 --> 07:18:31,380
with an earnest,

27001
07:18:31,380 --> 07:18:32,660
though guarded inquiry,

27002
07:18:32,960 --> 07:18:33,860
and they soon drew

27003
07:18:33,860 --> 07:18:34,760
from those inquiries

27004
07:18:34,760 --> 07:18:35,600
the full conviction

27005
07:18:35,600 --> 07:18:36,320
that one of them

27006
07:18:36,320 --> 07:18:37,400
at least. Knew.

27007
07:18:37,400 --> 07:18:38,600
What it was to love.

27008
07:18:39,080 --> 07:18:40,500
Of the lady sensations,

27009
07:18:40,500 --> 07:18:41,040
they remained

27010
07:18:41,040 --> 07:18:42,140
a little in doubt,

27011
07:18:42,140 --> 07:18:43,200
but that the gentleman

27012
07:18:43,200 --> 07:18:44,100
was overflowing

27013
07:18:44,100 --> 07:18:44,960
with admiration

27014
07:18:44,960 --> 07:18:46,200
was evident enough.

27015
07:18:46,340 --> 07:18:47,720
Elizabeth on her side

27016
07:18:47,760 --> 07:18:48,960
had much to do.

27017
07:18:49,080 --> 07:18:50,400
She wanted to ascertain

27018
07:18:50,400 --> 07:18:50,940
the feelings

27019
07:18:50,940 --> 07:18:52,140
of each of visitors.

27020
07:18:52,280 --> 07:18:52,880
She wanted

27021
07:18:52,880 --> 07:18:54,080
to compose her own

27022
07:18:54,140 --> 07:18:55,200
and to make herself

27023
07:18:55,200 --> 07:18:56,400
agreeable to all,

27024
07:18:56,520 --> 07:18:57,980
and in the latter object

27025
07:18:57,980 --> 07:18:58,640
where she feared

27026
07:18:58,640 --> 07:18:59,640
most to fail.

27027
07:18:59,640 --> 07:19:00,260
She was most

27028
07:19:00,260 --> 07:19:01,460
sure of success

27029
07:19:01,580 --> 07:19:02,280
for those to

27030
07:19:02,280 --> 07:19:03,060
whom she endeavor

27031
07:19:03,060 --> 07:19:03,980
to give pleasure

27032
07:19:03,980 --> 07:19:04,400
were pre

27033
07:19:04,400 --> 07:19:05,780
possessed in her favor.

27034
07:19:06,180 --> 07:19:07,220
Bingley was ready.

27035
07:19:07,220 --> 07:19:08,580
Georgiana was eager

27036
07:19:08,700 --> 07:19:10,140
and Darcy determined

27037
07:19:10,140 --> 07:19:11,340
to be pleased

27038
07:19:11,780 --> 07:19:12,840
in seeing Bingley.

27039
07:19:12,840 --> 07:19:13,320
Her thoughts

27040
07:19:13,320 --> 07:19:14,280
naturally flew

27041
07:19:14,280 --> 07:19:15,620
to her sister and

27042
07:19:15,620 --> 07:19:16,980
oh, how ardently did

27043
07:19:16,980 --> 07:19:17,780
she longed to know

27044
07:19:17,780 --> 07:19:18,740
whether any of his

27045
07:19:18,740 --> 07:19:19,460
were directed in a

27046
07:19:19,460 --> 07:19:20,660
like manner.

27047
07:19:20,700 --> 07:19:21,360
Sometime

27048
07:19:21,360 --> 07:19:22,100
she could fancy

27049
07:19:22,100 --> 07:19:23,300
that he talked less than

27050
07:19:23,300 --> 07:19:24,500
on former occasions

27051
07:19:24,680 --> 07:19:25,760
and once or twice

27052
07:19:25,760 --> 07:19:26,540
pleased herself

27053
07:19:26,540 --> 07:19:27,300
with the notion

27054
07:19:27,300 --> 07:19:28,100
that as

27055
07:19:28,100 --> 07:19:28,980
he looked at her,

27056
07:19:28,980 --> 07:19:30,180
he was trying to trace

27057
07:19:30,180 --> 07:19:31,380
a resemblance.

27058
07:19:31,440 --> 07:19:31,920
But though

27059
07:19:31,920 --> 07:19:33,240
this might be imaginary,

27060
07:19:33,420 --> 07:19:34,040
she could not

27061
07:19:34,040 --> 07:19:34,680
be deceived

27062
07:19:34,680 --> 07:19:35,600
as to his behavior

27063
07:19:35,600 --> 07:19:36,620
to Miss Darcy,

27064
07:19:36,620 --> 07:19:37,560
who had been set up

27065
07:19:37,560 --> 07:19:38,760
as a rival to Jane,

27066
07:19:39,080 --> 07:19:40,140
no look appeared

27067
07:19:40,140 --> 07:19:41,640
on either that spoke

27068
07:19:41,640 --> 07:19:42,840
particular regard.

27069
07:19:43,020 --> 07:19:43,920
Nothing occurred

27070
07:19:43,920 --> 07:19:44,520
between them

27071
07:19:44,520 --> 07:19:44,820
that could

27072
07:19:44,820 --> 07:19:45,800
justify the hopes

27073
07:19:45,800 --> 07:19:46,980
of his sister.

27074
07:19:46,980 --> 07:19:47,760
On this point,

27075
07:19:47,760 --> 07:19:48,980
she was soon satisfied

27076
07:19:49,260 --> 07:19:50,180
and two or three

27077
07:19:50,180 --> 07:19:51,000
little circumstance

27078
07:19:51,000 --> 07:19:51,500
as occurred

27079
07:19:51,500 --> 07:19:52,400
are they parted,

27080
07:19:52,400 --> 07:19:52,940
which in her

27081
07:19:52,940 --> 07:19:54,240
anxious interpretation

27082
07:19:54,380 --> 07:19:55,620
denoted a recollection

27083
07:19:55,620 --> 07:19:56,040
of Jane,

27084
07:19:56,040 --> 07:19:56,780
not until

27085
07:19:56,780 --> 07:19:57,980
shared by tenderness

27086
07:19:58,040 --> 07:19:58,760
and a wish of

27087
07:19:58,760 --> 07:19:59,420
saying more.

27088
07:19:59,420 --> 07:20:00,060
That might lead

27089
07:20:00,060 --> 07:20:01,280
to the mention of had

27090
07:20:01,280 --> 07:20:02,400
he dared,

27091
07:20:02,400 --> 07:20:03,360
he observed to her

27092
07:20:03,360 --> 07:20:03,960
at a moment

27093
07:20:03,960 --> 07:20:04,460
when the others

27094
07:20:04,460 --> 07:20:05,580
were talking together,

27095
07:20:05,580 --> 07:20:06,360
and in a tone

27096
07:20:06,360 --> 07:20:07,020
which had something

27097
07:20:07,020 --> 07:20:08,220
of real regret that.

27098
07:20:08,720 --> 07:20:10,020
It was a very long time

27099
07:20:10,020 --> 07:20:10,520
since he had

27100
07:20:10,520 --> 07:20:10,940
the pleasure

27101
07:20:10,940 --> 07:20:12,240
of seeing her and.

27102
07:20:12,240 --> 07:20:13,340
Before she could reply,

27103
07:20:13,340 --> 07:20:14,540
he added.

27104
07:20:14,760 --> 07:20:15,300
It is above

27105
07:20:15,300 --> 07:20:16,260
eight months.

27106
07:20:16,260 --> 07:20:16,860
We have not met

27107
07:20:16,860 --> 07:20:17,560
since the 26th

27108
07:20:17,560 --> 07:20:18,300
of November,

27109
07:20:18,300 --> 07:20:19,200
when we were all dancing

27110
07:20:19,200 --> 07:20:20,160
together at Netherfield.

27111
07:20:22,080 --> 07:20:22,740
Elizabeth was

27112
07:20:22,740 --> 07:20:23,760
pleased to find

27113
07:20:23,760 --> 07:20:25,020
his memory so exact,

27114
07:20:25,320 --> 07:20:26,340
and he afterwards

27115
07:20:26,340 --> 07:20:27,620
took occasion to ask her

27116
07:20:27,740 --> 07:20:28,700
when unattended

27117
07:20:28,700 --> 07:20:29,900
to by any of the rest

27118
07:20:30,080 --> 07:20:31,560
whether all her sisters

27119
07:20:31,560 --> 07:20:32,760
were at long born.

27120
07:20:32,900 --> 07:20:33,780
There was not much

27121
07:20:33,780 --> 07:20:34,460
in the question

27122
07:20:34,460 --> 07:20:34,920
nor in the

27123
07:20:34,920 --> 07:20:36,000
preceding remark,

27124
07:20:36,000 --> 07:20:36,780
but there was a look

27125
07:20:36,780 --> 07:20:37,400
and a manner

27126
07:20:37,400 --> 07:20:38,600
which gave them meaning.

27127
07:20:39,420 --> 07:20:40,580
It was often that

27128
07:20:40,580 --> 07:20:41,220
she could turn her

27129
07:20:41,220 --> 07:20:41,940
eyes on Mr.

27130
07:20:41,940 --> 07:20:43,140
Darcy himself,

27131
07:20:43,200 --> 07:20:44,120
but whenever she did

27132
07:20:44,120 --> 07:20:45,060
catch a glimpse,

27133
07:20:45,060 --> 07:20:46,320
she saw an expression

27134
07:20:46,320 --> 07:20:47,640
of general complacence.

27135
07:20:47,880 --> 07:20:49,100
And in all that, he said

27136
07:20:49,100 --> 07:20:50,780
she heard an so removed

27137
07:20:50,780 --> 07:20:51,560
from hauteur

27138
07:20:51,560 --> 07:20:52,200
or disdain

27139
07:20:52,200 --> 07:20:53,340
of his companions,

27140
07:20:53,340 --> 07:20:54,240
as convinced her

27141
07:20:54,240 --> 07:20:55,080
that the improvement

27142
07:20:55,080 --> 07:20:55,580
of manners

27143
07:20:55,580 --> 07:20:56,000
which she had

27144
07:20:56,000 --> 07:20:57,200
yesterday witnessed,

27145
07:20:57,240 --> 07:20:58,200
however temporary

27146
07:20:58,200 --> 07:20:58,920
its existence

27147
07:20:58,920 --> 07:20:59,820
might prove,

27148
07:20:59,820 --> 07:21:01,200
had at least outlived

27149
07:21:01,200 --> 07:21:02,360
one day

27150
07:21:02,360 --> 07:21:03,240
when she saw him,

27151
07:21:03,240 --> 07:21:03,980
thus seeking

27152
07:21:03,980 --> 07:21:04,700
the acquaintance

27153
07:21:04,700 --> 07:21:05,300
and courting

27154
07:21:05,300 --> 07:21:05,880
the good opinion

27155
07:21:05,880 --> 07:21:06,620
of people

27156
07:21:06,620 --> 07:21:07,040
with whom

27157
07:21:07,040 --> 07:21:07,820
any intercourse

27158
07:21:07,820 --> 07:21:08,360
a few months

27159
07:21:08,360 --> 07:21:09,120
ago would have been a.

27160
07:21:10,100 --> 07:21:10,380
When.

27161
07:21:10,380 --> 07:21:11,820
She saw him thus civil

27162
07:21:12,060 --> 07:21:13,460
not only to herself,

27163
07:21:13,700 --> 07:21:14,600
but to the very

27164
07:21:14,600 --> 07:21:15,260
relations

27165
07:21:15,260 --> 07:21:15,680
whom he had

27166
07:21:15,680 --> 07:21:16,880
openly disdained

27167
07:21:16,980 --> 07:21:17,780
and recollected

27168
07:21:17,780 --> 07:21:18,980
their last lively

27169
07:21:19,200 --> 07:21:20,400
in Huntsmen parsonage.

27170
07:21:20,780 --> 07:21:21,680
The difference?

27171
07:21:21,680 --> 07:21:22,940
The change was so.

27172
07:21:22,940 --> 07:21:23,840
Great and.

27173
07:21:23,840 --> 07:21:24,180
Struck

27174
07:21:24,180 --> 07:21:25,820
so forcibly on her mind

27175
07:21:26,060 --> 07:21:26,540
that she could

27176
07:21:26,540 --> 07:21:27,480
hardly restrain

27177
07:21:27,480 --> 07:21:28,340
her astonishment

27178
07:21:28,340 --> 07:21:29,540
from being.

27179
07:21:29,820 --> 07:21:30,620
Never

27180
07:21:30,620 --> 07:21:31,580
even in the company

27181
07:21:31,580 --> 07:21:32,040
of his dear

27182
07:21:32,040 --> 07:21:33,240
friends at Netherfield

27183
07:21:33,300 --> 07:21:34,200
or his dignified

27184
07:21:34,200 --> 07:21:35,520
relations at Rose Ings.

27185
07:21:35,780 --> 07:21:36,560
Had she seen him

27186
07:21:36,560 --> 07:21:37,520
so desirous

27187
07:21:37,520 --> 07:21:38,720
to please so.

27188
07:21:38,720 --> 07:21:39,380
Free from

27189
07:21:39,380 --> 07:21:40,380
self consequence

27190
07:21:40,380 --> 07:21:41,720
or unbending reserve

27191
07:21:41,720 --> 07:21:42,620
as now,

27192
07:21:42,620 --> 07:21:43,740
when no importance

27193
07:21:43,740 --> 07:21:44,280
could result

27194
07:21:44,280 --> 07:21:45,000
from the success

27195
07:21:45,000 --> 07:21:46,040
of his endeavors,

27196
07:21:46,040 --> 07:21:46,800
and when even

27197
07:21:46,800 --> 07:21:47,480
the acquaintance

27198
07:21:47,480 --> 07:21:48,020
of those to

27199
07:21:48,020 --> 07:21:48,800
whom his attentions

27200
07:21:48,800 --> 07:21:49,740
were addressed

27201
07:21:49,740 --> 07:21:50,540
would draw down

27202
07:21:50,540 --> 07:21:51,180
the ridicule

27203
07:21:51,180 --> 07:21:51,960
and censure

27204
07:21:51,960 --> 07:21:52,640
of the ladies.

27205
07:21:52,640 --> 07:21:53,660
Both of Netherfield

27206
07:21:53,660 --> 07:21:54,860
and Rose Ings,

27207
07:21:54,920 --> 07:21:55,520
their visitor

27208
07:21:55,520 --> 07:21:56,120
stayed with him

27209
07:21:56,120 --> 07:21:57,240
above half an hour,

27210
07:21:57,240 --> 07:21:58,160
and when they arose

27211
07:21:58,160 --> 07:21:59,340
to depart, Mr.

27212
07:21:59,340 --> 07:21:59,760
D'Arcy

27213
07:21:59,760 --> 07:22:00,620
called on his sister

27214
07:22:00,620 --> 07:22:01,200
to join him

27215
07:22:01,200 --> 07:22:01,860
in expressing

27216
07:22:01,860 --> 07:22:03,080
their wish of seeing Mr.

27217
07:22:03,080 --> 07:22:03,540
and Mrs.

27218
07:22:03,540 --> 07:22:05,120
Gardner and Miss Bennet

27219
07:22:05,340 --> 07:22:06,540
to dinner at Pemberley

27220
07:22:06,540 --> 07:22:07,220
before they left

27221
07:22:07,220 --> 07:22:08,340
the country.

27222
07:22:08,340 --> 07:22:09,240
Miss D'Arcy,

27223
07:22:09,240 --> 07:22:09,500
though,

27224
07:22:09,500 --> 07:22:10,280
with a diffidence

27225
07:22:10,280 --> 07:22:10,920
which marked her

27226
07:22:10,920 --> 07:22:11,760
a little in the habit

27227
07:22:11,760 --> 07:22:12,960
of giving invitations,

27228
07:22:13,100 --> 07:22:14,300
readily obeyed.

27229
07:22:14,580 --> 07:22:14,960
Mrs.

27230
07:22:14,960 --> 07:22:15,720
Gardner looked

27231
07:22:15,720 --> 07:22:17,220
at her niece, desirous

27232
07:22:17,220 --> 07:22:18,720
of knowing how she whom

27233
07:22:18,720 --> 07:22:19,380
the invitation

27234
07:22:19,380 --> 07:22:20,780
most concerned, felt

27235
07:22:20,780 --> 07:22:21,440
disposed

27236
07:22:21,440 --> 07:22:22,640
as to its acceptance.

27237
07:22:22,860 --> 07:22:23,580
But Elizabeth

27238
07:22:23,580 --> 07:22:24,200
had turned away

27239
07:22:24,200 --> 07:22:25,200
her head.

27240
07:22:25,200 --> 07:22:26,360
Presuming, however, that

27241
07:22:26,360 --> 07:22:27,020
this studied

27242
07:22:27,020 --> 07:22:27,780
avoidance spoke

27243
07:22:27,780 --> 07:22:28,160
rather

27244
07:22:28,160 --> 07:22:29,520
momentary embarrassment

27245
07:22:29,520 --> 07:22:30,260
than any dislike

27246
07:22:30,260 --> 07:22:31,400
of the proposal,

27247
07:22:31,400 --> 07:22:32,100
and seeing in

27248
07:22:32,100 --> 07:22:32,880
her husband,

27249
07:22:32,880 --> 07:22:34,340
who was fond of society

27250
07:22:34,580 --> 07:22:35,660
a perfect willingness

27251
07:22:35,660 --> 07:22:36,720
to accept it,

27252
07:22:36,720 --> 07:22:38,040
she ventured to engage

27253
07:22:38,160 --> 07:22:39,120
their attendance,

27254
07:22:39,120 --> 07:22:40,100
and the day after the

27255
07:22:40,100 --> 07:22:41,300
next was fixed on

27256
07:22:42,300 --> 07:22:43,620
Bingley expressed great

27257
07:22:43,620 --> 07:22:44,040
pleasure

27258
07:22:44,040 --> 07:22:44,700
in the certainty

27259
07:22:44,700 --> 07:22:45,080
of seeing

27260
07:22:45,080 --> 07:22:46,560
Elizabeth again, having

27261
07:22:46,560 --> 07:22:47,460
still a great deal

27262
07:22:47,460 --> 07:22:48,320
to say to her

27263
07:22:48,320 --> 07:22:49,340
and many inquiries

27264
07:22:49,340 --> 07:22:49,700
to make

27265
07:22:49,700 --> 07:22:50,240
after all

27266
07:22:50,240 --> 07:22:50,940
their Hertfordshire

27267
07:22:50,940 --> 07:22:51,920
friends.

27268
07:22:51,920 --> 07:22:52,640
Elizabeth

27269
07:22:52,640 --> 07:22:53,760
construing all this

27270
07:22:53,760 --> 07:22:54,720
into a wish of hearing

27271
07:22:54,720 --> 07:22:55,920
her speak of her sister.

27272
07:22:56,000 --> 07:22:57,120
Was pleased.

27273
07:22:57,120 --> 07:22:58,320
And on account

27274
07:22:58,340 --> 07:22:59,540
as well as some others

27275
07:22:59,840 --> 07:23:00,680
found herself

27276
07:23:00,680 --> 07:23:01,400
when their visitors

27277
07:23:01,400 --> 07:23:02,840
left them capable

27278
07:23:02,840 --> 07:23:03,500
of considering

27279
07:23:03,500 --> 07:23:04,440
the last half hour

27280
07:23:04,440 --> 07:23:05,640
with some satisfaction

27281
07:23:06,020 --> 07:23:06,260
though

27282
07:23:06,260 --> 07:23:07,460
while it was passing,

27283
07:23:07,500 --> 07:23:08,520
the enjoyment of it

27284
07:23:08,520 --> 07:23:10,160
had been little eager

27285
07:23:10,160 --> 07:23:10,980
to be alone

27286
07:23:10,980 --> 07:23:12,260
and fearful of inquiries

27287
07:23:12,260 --> 07:23:12,780
or hints

27288
07:23:12,780 --> 07:23:13,980
from her uncle and aunt.

27289
07:23:14,060 --> 07:23:14,960
She stayed with them

27290
07:23:14,960 --> 07:23:15,740
only long enough

27291
07:23:15,740 --> 07:23:16,700
to hear their favorable

27292
07:23:16,700 --> 07:23:17,900
opinion of Bingley

27293
07:23:17,900 --> 07:23:19,020
and then hurried away

27294
07:23:19,020 --> 07:23:20,220
to dress.

27295
07:23:20,340 --> 07:23:20,940
But she had

27296
07:23:20,940 --> 07:23:22,340
no reason to fear Mr.

27297
07:23:22,340 --> 07:23:22,820
and Mrs.

27298
07:23:22,820 --> 07:23:24,140
Gardner's curiosity.

27299
07:23:24,480 --> 07:23:25,520
It was not their wish

27300
07:23:25,520 --> 07:23:26,160
to force her

27301
07:23:26,160 --> 07:23:27,360
communication.

27302
07:23:27,380 --> 07:23:28,220
It was evident

27303
07:23:28,220 --> 07:23:29,180
that she was much better

27304
07:23:29,180 --> 07:23:30,020
acquainted with Mr.

27305
07:23:30,020 --> 07:23:30,740
Darcy

27306
07:23:30,740 --> 07:23:31,880
than they had before.

27307
07:23:31,880 --> 07:23:32,580
Any idea.

27308
07:23:32,580 --> 07:23:33,380
Of it.

27309
07:23:33,380 --> 07:23:34,020
Was evident

27310
07:23:34,020 --> 07:23:35,040
that he was very much

27311
07:23:35,040 --> 07:23:36,240
in love with her.

27312
07:23:36,300 --> 07:23:37,140
They saw much

27313
07:23:37,140 --> 07:23:38,600
to interest, but nothing

27314
07:23:38,600 --> 07:23:39,960
to justify inquiry

27315
07:23:40,920 --> 07:23:41,400
of Mr.

27316
07:23:41,400 --> 07:23:41,840
Darcy.

27317
07:23:41,840 --> 07:23:42,200
It was now

27318
07:23:42,200 --> 07:23:43,400
a matter of anxiety

27319
07:23:43,400 --> 07:23:44,660
to think well, and

27320
07:23:44,660 --> 07:23:45,140
as far as

27321
07:23:45,140 --> 07:23:45,780
their acquaintance

27322
07:23:45,780 --> 07:23:46,340
reached,

27323
07:23:46,340 --> 07:23:47,880
there was fault to find

27324
07:23:48,300 --> 07:23:48,860
they could not

27325
07:23:48,860 --> 07:23:49,700
be untouched

27326
07:23:49,700 --> 07:23:50,900
by his politeness.

27327
07:23:50,960 --> 07:23:51,920
And had they drawn

27328
07:23:51,920 --> 07:23:52,520
his character

27329
07:23:52,520 --> 07:23:53,540
from their own feelings

27330
07:23:53,540 --> 07:23:54,740
and his servants report

27331
07:23:54,920 --> 07:23:55,980
without any reference

27332
07:23:55,980 --> 07:23:57,180
to any other.

27333
07:23:57,260 --> 07:23:57,860
The circle

27334
07:23:57,860 --> 07:23:58,640
in Hertfordshire,

27335
07:23:58,640 --> 07:23:59,820
to which he was known,

27336
07:23:59,820 --> 07:24:00,300
would not have

27337
07:24:00,300 --> 07:24:01,520
recognized it for Mr.

27338
07:24:01,520 --> 07:24:02,540
Darcy.

27339
07:24:02,540 --> 07:24:03,240
There was now

27340
07:24:03,240 --> 07:24:04,200
an interest, however,

27341
07:24:04,200 --> 07:24:04,760
in believing

27342
07:24:04,760 --> 07:24:05,820
the housekeeper

27343
07:24:05,820 --> 07:24:06,960
and soon became

27344
07:24:06,960 --> 07:24:07,760
sensible that

27345
07:24:07,760 --> 07:24:08,400
the authority

27346
07:24:08,400 --> 07:24:09,060
of a servant

27347
07:24:09,060 --> 07:24:09,660
who had known him

27348
07:24:09,660 --> 07:24:10,160
since he was

27349
07:24:10,160 --> 07:24:11,120
four years old

27350
07:24:11,120 --> 07:24:12,360
and whose own manners

27351
07:24:12,360 --> 07:24:12,920
indicated

27352
07:24:12,920 --> 07:24:14,000
respectability.

27353
07:24:14,000 --> 07:24:14,600
Was not to.

27354
07:24:14,600 --> 07:24:15,840
Be hastily rejected.

27355
07:24:16,320 --> 07:24:17,480
Neither had anything

27356
07:24:17,480 --> 07:24:17,880
occurred

27357
07:24:17,880 --> 07:24:18,680
in the intelligence

27358
07:24:18,680 --> 07:24:19,880
of their Lampton friends

27359
07:24:20,060 --> 07:24:21,120
that could materially

27360
07:24:21,120 --> 07:24:22,320
lessen its weight.

27361
07:24:22,520 --> 07:24:23,360
They had nothing to

27362
07:24:23,360 --> 07:24:24,120
accuse him of,

27363
07:24:24,120 --> 07:24:25,160
but pride.

27364
07:24:25,160 --> 07:24:26,300
Pride he probably.

27365
07:24:26,300 --> 07:24:26,900
Had.

27366
07:24:26,900 --> 07:24:28,160
And if not, it would

27367
07:24:28,160 --> 07:24:28,560
certainly.

27368
07:24:28,560 --> 07:24:29,160
Be imputed

27369
07:24:29,160 --> 07:24:30,140
by the inhabitants

27370
07:24:30,140 --> 07:24:31,460
of a small market town

27371
07:24:31,460 --> 07:24:32,280
where the family did

27372
07:24:32,280 --> 07:24:33,480
not visit.

27373
07:24:33,480 --> 07:24:34,440
It was acknowledged,

27374
07:24:34,440 --> 07:24:34,980
however, that

27375
07:24:34,980 --> 07:24:36,180
he was a liberal

27376
07:24:36,240 --> 07:24:37,280
and did much good

27377
07:24:37,280 --> 07:24:38,480
among the poor

27378
07:24:39,000 --> 07:24:40,360
with respect to Wickham.

27379
07:24:40,380 --> 07:24:41,100
The traveler

27380
07:24:41,100 --> 07:24:41,840
soon found that

27381
07:24:41,840 --> 07:24:42,840
he was not held there

27382
07:24:42,840 --> 07:24:44,040
in much estimation,

27383
07:24:44,240 --> 07:24:44,600
for though

27384
07:24:44,600 --> 07:24:45,000
the chief

27385
07:24:45,000 --> 07:24:45,740
of his concerns

27386
07:24:45,740 --> 07:24:46,200
with the son

27387
07:24:46,200 --> 07:24:46,860
of his patron

27388
07:24:46,860 --> 07:24:47,600
were imperfectly

27389
07:24:47,600 --> 07:24:48,620
understood.

27390
07:24:48,620 --> 07:24:49,400
It was yet a.

27391
07:24:49,400 --> 07:24:50,660
Well-Known fact that

27392
07:24:50,880 --> 07:24:51,320
on his

27393
07:24:51,320 --> 07:24:52,520
quitting Derbyshire,

27394
07:24:52,560 --> 07:24:53,780
he had left many debts

27395
07:24:53,780 --> 07:24:55,160
behind him, which Mr.

27396
07:24:55,160 --> 07:24:55,820
Darcy had

27397
07:24:55,820 --> 07:24:57,300
afterwards discharged.

27398
07:24:58,380 --> 07:24:59,580
As for Elizabeth,

27399
07:24:59,700 --> 07:25:00,380
her thoughts

27400
07:25:00,380 --> 07:25:01,260
were at Pemberley

27401
07:25:01,260 --> 07:25:01,760
this evening,

27402
07:25:01,760 --> 07:25:02,960
more than the last.

27403
07:25:02,960 --> 07:25:03,380
And the.

27404
07:25:03,380 --> 07:25:04,100
Evening, though

27405
07:25:04,100 --> 07:25:04,820
as it passed,

27406
07:25:04,820 --> 07:25:05,900
it seemed long.

27407
07:25:05,900 --> 07:25:06,620
Was not long.

27408
07:25:06,620 --> 07:25:07,520
Enough to determine

27409
07:25:07,520 --> 07:25:08,900
her feelings towards one

27410
07:25:08,900 --> 07:25:10,100
in that mention,

27411
07:25:10,100 --> 07:25:11,040
and she lay awake

27412
07:25:11,040 --> 07:25:12,020
two whole hours

27413
07:25:12,020 --> 07:25:12,660
endeavoring to

27414
07:25:12,660 --> 07:25:13,860
make them out.

27415
07:25:13,920 --> 07:25:14,660
She certainly did

27416
07:25:14,660 --> 07:25:15,720
not hate them.

27417
07:25:15,720 --> 07:25:17,000
No hatred

27418
07:25:17,000 --> 07:25:17,840
had vanished long.

27419
07:25:17,840 --> 07:25:18,960
Ago, and she.

27420
07:25:18,960 --> 07:25:20,180
Had almost as long been

27421
07:25:20,180 --> 07:25:20,940
ashamed of ever

27422
07:25:20,940 --> 07:25:21,740
feeling a dislike

27423
07:25:21,740 --> 07:25:22,440
against him.

27424
07:25:22,440 --> 07:25:23,640
That could be so called

27425
07:25:24,000 --> 07:25:24,740
the respect

27426
07:25:24,740 --> 07:25:25,280
created

27427
07:25:25,280 --> 07:25:26,000
by the conviction

27428
07:25:26,000 --> 07:25:26,240
of his

27429
07:25:26,240 --> 07:25:27,440
valuable qualities,

27430
07:25:27,600 --> 07:25:28,380
though at first

27431
07:25:28,380 --> 07:25:29,580
unwillingly admitted,

27432
07:25:29,820 --> 07:25:30,860
had for some time

27433
07:25:30,860 --> 07:25:32,180
ceased to be repugnance

27434
07:25:32,180 --> 07:25:33,260
to her feeling,

27435
07:25:33,260 --> 07:25:33,720
and it was

27436
07:25:33,720 --> 07:25:34,460
now heightened

27437
07:25:34,460 --> 07:25:35,040
into somewhat

27438
07:25:35,040 --> 07:25:36,240
of a friendlier nature

27439
07:25:36,420 --> 07:25:37,340
by the testimony

27440
07:25:37,340 --> 07:25:38,660
so highly in his favor

27441
07:25:38,880 --> 07:25:39,900
and bringing forward

27442
07:25:39,900 --> 07:25:40,680
his disposition

27443
07:25:40,680 --> 07:25:41,960
and so amiable a light.

27444
07:25:42,120 --> 07:25:42,360
Which.

27445
07:25:42,360 --> 07:25:43,700
Yesterday had produced.

27446
07:25:44,040 --> 07:25:45,440
But above all, above

27447
07:25:45,440 --> 07:25:46,700
respect and esteem.

27448
07:25:47,000 --> 07:25:47,880
There was a motive

27449
07:25:47,880 --> 07:25:49,020
within her of goodwill

27450
07:25:49,020 --> 07:25:49,220
which

27451
07:25:49,220 --> 07:25:50,420
could not be overlooked.

27452
07:25:50,840 --> 07:25:52,040
It was gratitude.

27453
07:25:52,340 --> 07:25:53,720
Gratitude not merely

27454
07:25:53,720 --> 07:25:54,140
for having

27455
07:25:54,140 --> 07:25:55,280
once loved her,

27456
07:25:55,280 --> 07:25:56,100
but for loving her

27457
07:25:56,100 --> 07:25:57,020
still well enough

27458
07:25:57,020 --> 07:25:57,480
to forgive

27459
07:25:57,480 --> 07:25:58,400
all the petulance

27460
07:25:58,400 --> 07:25:59,120
and acrimony

27461
07:25:59,120 --> 07:25:59,700
of her manner

27462
07:25:59,700 --> 07:26:00,660
and rejecting him

27463
07:26:00,660 --> 07:26:01,280
and all the

27464
07:26:01,280 --> 07:26:02,700
unjust accusations

27465
07:26:02,700 --> 07:26:03,500
accompanying her

27466
07:26:03,500 --> 07:26:04,700
rejection.

27467
07:26:04,760 --> 07:26:05,820
He, who

27468
07:26:05,820 --> 07:26:06,800
she had been persuaded

27469
07:26:06,800 --> 07:26:07,440
with avoid her

27470
07:26:07,440 --> 07:26:08,640
as his greatest enemy.

27471
07:26:08,780 --> 07:26:09,260
Seemed

27472
07:26:09,260 --> 07:26:09,560
on this

27473
07:26:09,560 --> 07:26:10,740
accidental meeting,

27474
07:26:10,740 --> 07:26:11,400
most eager.

27475
07:26:11,400 --> 07:26:12,020
To preserve

27476
07:26:12,020 --> 07:26:12,920
the acquaintance,

27477
07:26:12,920 --> 07:26:13,500
and without

27478
07:26:13,500 --> 07:26:15,440
any indelicate of regard

27479
07:26:15,560 --> 07:26:16,700
or any peculiarity

27480
07:26:16,700 --> 07:26:17,360
of manner

27481
07:26:17,360 --> 07:26:18,440
where their two selves

27482
07:26:18,440 --> 07:26:19,620
only were concerned

27483
07:26:19,620 --> 07:26:20,420
with soliciting

27484
07:26:20,420 --> 07:26:21,120
the good opinion

27485
07:26:21,120 --> 07:26:21,980
of her friends

27486
07:26:21,980 --> 07:26:23,120
and bent on making her

27487
07:26:23,120 --> 07:26:24,320
known to his sister

27488
07:26:24,620 --> 07:26:25,500
such a change

27489
07:26:25,500 --> 07:26:26,000
in a man of

27490
07:26:26,000 --> 07:26:27,120
so much pride.

27491
07:26:27,120 --> 07:26:27,660
Exciting

27492
07:26:27,660 --> 07:26:28,860
not only astonishment,

27493
07:26:28,860 --> 07:26:30,060
but gratitude

27494
07:26:30,140 --> 07:26:31,200
for to love

27495
07:26:31,200 --> 07:26:32,280
ardent love.

27496
07:26:32,280 --> 07:26:33,740
It must be attributed,

27497
07:26:34,160 --> 07:26:35,100
and as such

27498
07:26:35,100 --> 07:26:36,180
its impression on her

27499
07:26:36,180 --> 07:26:36,800
was of a sorts

27500
07:26:36,800 --> 07:26:38,340
to be encouraged, as by.

27501
07:26:38,340 --> 07:26:39,740
No means unpleasing,

27502
07:26:39,960 --> 07:26:40,280
though it.

27503
07:26:40,280 --> 07:26:40,860
Could not be

27504
07:26:40,860 --> 07:26:42,060
exactly defined.

27505
07:26:42,320 --> 07:26:43,440
She respected.

27506
07:26:43,440 --> 07:26:44,520
She.

27507
07:26:44,520 --> 07:26:45,800
She was grateful to him.

27508
07:26:46,020 --> 07:26:47,460
She felt a real interest

27509
07:26:47,460 --> 07:26:48,560
in his welfare.

27510
07:26:48,560 --> 07:26:49,520
And she only wants

27511
07:26:49,520 --> 07:26:49,920
to know

27512
07:26:49,920 --> 07:26:50,840
how far she wished

27513
07:26:50,840 --> 07:26:51,500
that welfare

27514
07:26:51,500 --> 07:26:52,700
to depend upon herself

27515
07:26:52,980 --> 07:26:53,660
and how far

27516
07:26:53,660 --> 07:26:53,960
would be

27517
07:26:53,960 --> 07:26:54,660
for the happiness

27518
07:26:54,660 --> 07:26:55,140
of both.

27519
07:26:55,140 --> 07:26:55,400
That she

27520
07:26:55,400 --> 07:26:56,600
should employ the power

27521
07:26:56,600 --> 07:26:57,900
which her fancy told her

27522
07:26:57,900 --> 07:26:59,000
she still possessed

27523
07:26:59,000 --> 07:26:59,960
of bringing on her

27524
07:26:59,960 --> 07:27:00,600
the renewal of

27525
07:27:00,600 --> 07:27:01,800
his addresses.

27526
07:27:01,940 --> 07:27:02,540
It had been.

27527
07:27:02,540 --> 07:27:03,740
Settled in the evening,

27528
07:27:03,840 --> 07:27:05,040
the aunt and her niece.

27529
07:27:05,120 --> 07:27:05,540
That such a.

27530
07:27:05,540 --> 07:27:06,560
Striking civility

27531
07:27:06,560 --> 07:27:06,980
has missed

27532
07:27:06,980 --> 07:27:07,560
Darcy's in

27533
07:27:07,560 --> 07:27:08,360
coming to see them

27534
07:27:08,360 --> 07:27:09,060
on the very day

27535
07:27:09,060 --> 07:27:09,740
of her arrival

27536
07:27:09,740 --> 07:27:10,700
at Pemberley,

27537
07:27:10,700 --> 07:27:11,660
for she had reached it

27538
07:27:11,660 --> 07:27:12,420
only to a late

27539
07:27:12,420 --> 07:27:13,280
breakfast.

27540
07:27:13,280 --> 07:27:14,520
Ought to be imitated,

27541
07:27:14,720 --> 07:27:15,480
though it could not.

27542
07:27:15,480 --> 07:27:16,320
Be equaled

27543
07:27:16,320 --> 07:27:17,400
by some exertion

27544
07:27:17,400 --> 07:27:18,080
of politeness

27545
07:27:18,080 --> 07:27:19,160
on their side,

27546
07:27:19,160 --> 07:27:20,360
and consequently

27547
07:27:20,400 --> 07:27:20,900
that it would be

27548
07:27:20,900 --> 07:27:21,960
highly expedient

27549
07:27:21,960 --> 07:27:22,620
to wait on her

27550
07:27:22,620 --> 07:27:23,220
at Pemberley

27551
07:27:23,220 --> 07:27:24,420
the following morning.

27552
07:27:24,600 --> 07:27:25,500
They were therefore

27553
07:27:25,500 --> 07:27:26,340
to go.

27554
07:27:26,340 --> 07:27:27,600
Elizabeth was pleased,

27555
07:27:27,840 --> 07:27:28,020
though,

27556
07:27:28,020 --> 07:27:28,980
when she asked herself

27557
07:27:28,980 --> 07:27:29,780
the reason.

27558
07:27:29,780 --> 07:27:30,140
She had

27559
07:27:30,140 --> 07:27:31,140
very little to say

27560
07:27:31,140 --> 07:27:32,340
in reply.

27561
07:27:32,360 --> 07:27:33,200
Mr.

27562
07:27:33,200 --> 07:27:34,020
left them soon

27563
07:27:34,020 --> 07:27:35,100
after breakfast.

27564
07:27:35,100 --> 07:27:36,080
The fishing scheme

27565
07:27:36,080 --> 07:27:36,680
had been renewed

27566
07:27:36,680 --> 07:27:37,560
the day before

27567
07:27:37,560 --> 07:27:37,860
and a

27568
07:27:37,860 --> 07:27:39,020
positive engagement

27569
07:27:39,020 --> 07:27:39,920
made of his meeting

27570
07:27:39,920 --> 07:27:40,920
some of the gentlemen at

27571
07:27:40,920 --> 07:27:42,180
Pemberley before noon.

27572
07:27:44,420 --> 07:27:45,680
Chapter 45.

27573
07:27:47,000 --> 07:27:47,720
Convinced as

27574
07:27:47,720 --> 07:27:48,440
Elizabeth now

27575
07:27:48,440 --> 07:27:49,160
was that Ms..

27576
07:27:49,160 --> 07:27:49,940
Bailey's dislike

27577
07:27:49,940 --> 07:27:50,240
of her

27578
07:27:50,240 --> 07:27:51,020
had originated

27579
07:27:51,020 --> 07:27:52,020
in jealousy.

27580
07:27:52,020 --> 07:27:52,800
She could not help.

27581
07:27:52,800 --> 07:27:54,020
Feeling how unwelcome

27582
07:27:54,020 --> 07:27:54,620
her appearance

27583
07:27:54,620 --> 07:27:55,220
at Pemberley

27584
07:27:55,220 --> 07:27:56,300
must be to her,

27585
07:27:56,300 --> 07:27:57,600
and was curious to know

27586
07:27:57,600 --> 07:27:58,740
with how much civility

27587
07:27:58,740 --> 07:27:59,860
on that lady's side,

27588
07:27:59,860 --> 07:28:00,500
the acquaintance

27589
07:28:00,500 --> 07:28:01,080
would now be.

27590
07:28:01,080 --> 07:28:02,280
Renewed.

27591
07:28:02,360 --> 07:28:03,560
On reaching the house.

27592
07:28:03,620 --> 07:28:04,280
They were shown

27593
07:28:04,280 --> 07:28:04,800
through the hall

27594
07:28:04,800 --> 07:28:05,840
into the saloon,

27595
07:28:05,840 --> 07:28:07,040
whose northern aspect

27596
07:28:07,040 --> 07:28:07,520
rendered it

27597
07:28:07,520 --> 07:28:08,720
delightful for summer.

27598
07:28:09,020 --> 07:28:09,800
Its windows

27599
07:28:09,800 --> 07:28:11,000
opening to the ground,

27600
07:28:11,000 --> 07:28:11,640
admitted A

27601
07:28:11,640 --> 07:28:12,480
most refreshing

27602
07:28:12,480 --> 07:28:13,460
view of the high Woody

27603
07:28:13,460 --> 07:28:14,660
hills behind the house.

27604
07:28:14,900 --> 07:28:15,320
And of the.

27605
07:28:15,320 --> 07:28:16,200
Beautiful oaks

27606
07:28:16,200 --> 07:28:17,480
and Spanish chestnuts

27607
07:28:17,660 --> 07:28:18,000
which were

27608
07:28:18,000 --> 07:28:18,680
scattered over

27609
07:28:18,680 --> 07:28:19,920
the intermediate lawn.

27610
07:28:20,600 --> 07:28:21,500
In this house

27611
07:28:21,500 --> 07:28:21,980
were received

27612
07:28:21,980 --> 07:28:23,060
by Miss Darcy,

27613
07:28:23,060 --> 07:28:23,880
who was sitting there

27614
07:28:23,880 --> 07:28:24,300
with Mrs.

27615
07:28:24,300 --> 07:28:25,620
Hurst and Miss Bingley

27616
07:28:25,860 --> 07:28:26,900
and the lady with whom

27617
07:28:26,900 --> 07:28:28,100
she lived in London.

27618
07:28:28,520 --> 07:28:29,220
Georgina's

27619
07:28:29,220 --> 07:28:29,960
reception of them

27620
07:28:29,960 --> 07:28:31,040
was very civil,

27621
07:28:31,040 --> 07:28:31,700
but attended

27622
07:28:31,700 --> 07:28:32,000
with all

27623
07:28:32,000 --> 07:28:32,880
the embarrassment

27624
07:28:32,880 --> 07:28:33,800
which, though

27625
07:28:33,800 --> 07:28:35,040
proceeding from shyness

27626
07:28:35,040 --> 07:28:35,220
and the

27627
07:28:35,220 --> 07:28:36,420
fear of doing wrong,

27628
07:28:36,500 --> 07:28:37,160
would easily

27629
07:28:37,160 --> 07:28:37,680
give to those

27630
07:28:37,680 --> 07:28:38,520
who felt themselves

27631
07:28:38,520 --> 07:28:39,420
inferior.

27632
07:28:39,420 --> 07:28:40,260
The belief of her

27633
07:28:40,260 --> 07:28:41,060
being proud

27634
07:28:41,060 --> 07:28:42,200
and reserved.

27635
07:28:42,200 --> 07:28:42,600
Mrs.

27636
07:28:42,600 --> 07:28:43,620
Gardiner and her niece,

27637
07:28:43,620 --> 07:28:44,840
however, did her justice

27638
07:28:45,020 --> 07:28:47,000
and pitied her by Mrs.

27639
07:28:47,000 --> 07:28:48,200
Hurst and Miss Bingley.

27640
07:28:48,200 --> 07:28:48,840
They were noticed

27641
07:28:48,840 --> 07:28:50,040
only by a curtsey

27642
07:28:50,220 --> 07:28:51,540
and on their seated

27643
07:28:51,780 --> 07:28:52,760
a pause.

27644
07:28:52,760 --> 07:28:53,840
Awkward as such,

27645
07:28:53,840 --> 07:28:54,960
pauses must always.

27646
07:28:54,960 --> 07:28:56,240
Be succeeded.

27647
07:28:56,240 --> 07:28:57,440
For a few moments.

27648
07:28:57,560 --> 07:28:58,680
It was first broken

27649
07:28:58,680 --> 07:28:59,180
by Mrs.

27650
07:28:59,180 --> 07:29:00,720
Annesley, a genteel

27651
07:29:00,720 --> 07:29:01,920
agreeable looking woman

27652
07:29:02,060 --> 07:29:02,680
whose endeavor

27653
07:29:02,680 --> 07:29:03,240
to introduce

27654
07:29:03,240 --> 07:29:04,460
some kind of discourse

27655
07:29:04,460 --> 07:29:04,920
proved her

27656
07:29:04,920 --> 07:29:05,400
to be more

27657
07:29:05,400 --> 07:29:06,440
truly well-bred

27658
07:29:06,440 --> 07:29:06,920
than either

27659
07:29:06,920 --> 07:29:07,880
of the others.

27660
07:29:07,880 --> 07:29:09,300
And between her and Mrs.

27661
07:29:09,300 --> 07:29:10,020
Gardiner,

27662
07:29:10,020 --> 07:29:11,040
with occasional help

27663
07:29:11,040 --> 07:29:11,960
from Elizabeth.

27664
07:29:11,960 --> 07:29:12,840
The conversation

27665
07:29:12,840 --> 07:29:14,040
was carried on.

27666
07:29:14,180 --> 07:29:14,900
Miss Darcy

27667
07:29:14,900 --> 07:29:15,840
looked as if she wished

27668
07:29:15,840 --> 07:29:16,440
for courage

27669
07:29:16,440 --> 07:29:17,640
enough to join in it,

27670
07:29:17,660 --> 07:29:18,600
and sometimes

27671
07:29:18,600 --> 07:29:19,100
to adventure

27672
07:29:19,100 --> 07:29:20,160
a short sentence

27673
07:29:20,160 --> 07:29:21,060
when there was least

27674
07:29:21,060 --> 07:29:21,780
danger of its

27675
07:29:21,780 --> 07:29:22,980
being heard.

27676
07:29:23,400 --> 07:29:24,320
Elizabeth soon

27677
07:29:24,320 --> 07:29:25,520
saw that she was herself

27678
07:29:25,520 --> 07:29:26,040
closely

27679
07:29:26,040 --> 07:29:27,240
watched by Miss Bingley

27680
07:29:27,440 --> 07:29:28,020
and that she

27681
07:29:28,020 --> 07:29:29,220
could not speak a word,

27682
07:29:29,220 --> 07:29:30,680
especially to Miss Darcy

27683
07:29:30,920 --> 07:29:31,880
without calling her

27684
07:29:31,880 --> 07:29:33,020
attention.

27685
07:29:33,020 --> 07:29:34,100
This observation

27686
07:29:34,100 --> 07:29:34,520
would not have

27687
07:29:34,520 --> 07:29:35,100
prevented her

27688
07:29:35,100 --> 07:29:35,580
from trying

27689
07:29:35,580 --> 07:29:36,780
to talk to the latter

27690
07:29:36,900 --> 07:29:38,100
had they not been seated

27691
07:29:38,100 --> 07:29:38,300
at an

27692
07:29:38,300 --> 07:29:39,540
inconvenient distance.

27693
07:29:39,900 --> 07:29:40,520
But she was not.

27694
07:29:40,520 --> 07:29:41,360
Sorry to be spared

27695
07:29:41,360 --> 07:29:42,000
the necessity

27696
07:29:42,000 --> 07:29:43,160
of saying much.

27697
07:29:43,160 --> 07:29:44,000
Her own thoughts

27698
07:29:44,000 --> 07:29:45,180
were employing her.

27699
07:29:45,180 --> 07:29:45,900
She expected

27700
07:29:45,900 --> 07:29:46,580
every moment

27701
07:29:46,580 --> 07:29:47,000
that some of

27702
07:29:47,000 --> 07:29:47,540
the gentlemen

27703
07:29:47,540 --> 07:29:48,740
would enter the room.

27704
07:29:48,740 --> 07:29:49,680
She wished.

27705
07:29:49,680 --> 07:29:50,640
She feared that

27706
07:29:50,640 --> 07:29:51,560
the master of the house

27707
07:29:51,560 --> 07:29:52,760
might be amongst them,

27708
07:29:52,880 --> 07:29:53,940
and whether she wished

27709
07:29:53,940 --> 07:29:54,540
or feared it.

27710
07:29:54,540 --> 07:29:55,500
Most, she could.

27711
07:29:55,500 --> 07:29:56,700
Scarcely determine.

27712
07:29:56,940 --> 07:29:57,900
After sitting in this

27713
07:29:57,900 --> 07:29:58,220
manner

27714
07:29:58,220 --> 07:29:59,120
a quarter of an hour

27715
07:29:59,120 --> 07:29:59,760
without hearing

27716
07:29:59,760 --> 07:30:00,960
the Spengler's voice,

27717
07:30:01,020 --> 07:30:02,180
Elizabeth was roused

27718
07:30:02,180 --> 07:30:02,780
by receiving

27719
07:30:02,780 --> 07:30:04,220
from her a cold inquiry.

27720
07:30:04,220 --> 07:30:04,540
After the

27721
07:30:04,540 --> 07:30:05,740
health of her family.

27722
07:30:05,820 --> 07:30:06,920
She answered with equal

27723
07:30:06,920 --> 07:30:07,440
indifference

27724
07:30:07,440 --> 07:30:08,300
and brevity,

27725
07:30:08,300 --> 07:30:09,320
and the others said

27726
07:30:09,320 --> 07:30:10,340
more.

27727
07:30:10,340 --> 07:30:11,460
The next variation,

27728
07:30:11,460 --> 07:30:11,640
which

27729
07:30:11,640 --> 07:30:12,740
their visit afforded

27730
07:30:12,740 --> 07:30:13,400
was produced

27731
07:30:13,400 --> 07:30:14,060
by the entrance

27732
07:30:14,060 --> 07:30:14,660
of servants

27733
07:30:14,660 --> 07:30:16,140
with cold meat, cake

27734
07:30:16,320 --> 07:30:17,420
and a variety of all

27735
07:30:17,420 --> 07:30:17,960
the finest

27736
07:30:17,960 --> 07:30:19,160
fruits and season.

27737
07:30:19,400 --> 07:30:20,360
But this did not.

27738
07:30:20,360 --> 07:30:20,960
Take place

27739
07:30:20,960 --> 07:30:21,740
till after many

27740
07:30:21,740 --> 07:30:22,380
a significant

27741
07:30:22,380 --> 07:30:24,120
look and smile from Mrs.

27742
07:30:24,120 --> 07:30:24,980
Ainsley to Mr.

27743
07:30:24,980 --> 07:30:26,180
Darcy had been given

27744
07:30:26,280 --> 07:30:27,000
to remind her

27745
07:30:27,000 --> 07:30:28,200
of her post.

27746
07:30:28,220 --> 07:30:29,400
There was employment

27747
07:30:29,400 --> 07:30:30,600
for the whole party

27748
07:30:30,720 --> 07:30:31,100
for though

27749
07:30:31,100 --> 07:30:32,300
they could not all talk.

27750
07:30:32,420 --> 07:30:32,960
They could all.

27751
07:30:32,960 --> 07:30:33,600
Eat.

27752
07:30:33,600 --> 07:30:34,020
And the

27753
07:30:34,020 --> 07:30:34,980
beautiful pyramids

27754
07:30:34,980 --> 07:30:35,600
of grapes,

27755
07:30:35,600 --> 07:30:36,420
nectarines and.

27756
07:30:36,420 --> 07:30:37,460
Peaches soon.

27757
07:30:37,460 --> 07:30:38,100
Collected them

27758
07:30:38,100 --> 07:30:39,000
round the table.

27759
07:30:39,960 --> 07:30:41,040
While thus engaged,

27760
07:30:41,040 --> 07:30:41,580
Elizabeth

27761
07:30:41,580 --> 07:30:42,780
had a fair opportunity

27762
07:30:42,780 --> 07:30:43,440
of deciding

27763
07:30:43,440 --> 07:30:44,520
whether she most feared

27764
07:30:44,520 --> 07:30:45,000
or wished

27765
07:30:45,000 --> 07:30:45,740
for the appearance

27766
07:30:45,740 --> 07:30:46,100
of Mr.

27767
07:30:46,100 --> 07:30:47,640
Darcy by the feelings

27768
07:30:47,640 --> 07:30:48,540
which prevailed on his

27769
07:30:48,540 --> 07:30:49,740
entering the room.

27770
07:30:49,740 --> 07:30:50,880
And then, though,

27771
07:30:50,880 --> 07:30:51,740
but a moment before

27772
07:30:51,740 --> 07:30:52,460
she had believed her

27773
07:30:52,460 --> 07:30:53,660
wishes to predominate,

27774
07:30:53,820 --> 07:30:55,020
she began to regret

27775
07:30:55,020 --> 07:30:56,220
that he came.

27776
07:30:56,640 --> 07:30:57,300
He had been some.

27777
07:30:57,300 --> 07:30:57,920
Time with Mr.

27778
07:30:57,920 --> 07:30:59,520
Gardiner Who, with two

27779
07:30:59,520 --> 07:30:59,960
or three other

27780
07:30:59,960 --> 07:31:00,560
gentlemen from

27781
07:31:00,560 --> 07:31:01,980
the house, was engaged

27782
07:31:01,980 --> 07:31:02,820
by the river

27783
07:31:02,820 --> 07:31:03,660
and had left him

27784
07:31:03,660 --> 07:31:04,440
only on learning

27785
07:31:04,440 --> 07:31:05,000
that the ladies

27786
07:31:05,000 --> 07:31:06,060
of the family intended

27787
07:31:06,060 --> 07:31:06,380
a visit

27788
07:31:06,380 --> 07:31:07,320
to Georgiana that.

27789
07:31:07,320 --> 07:31:08,240
Morning.

27790
07:31:08,240 --> 07:31:09,180
No sooner did

27791
07:31:09,180 --> 07:31:09,800
he appear, then

27792
07:31:09,800 --> 07:31:10,700
Elizabeth wisely

27793
07:31:10,700 --> 07:31:11,300
resolved to be

27794
07:31:11,300 --> 07:31:12,140
perfectly easy

27795
07:31:12,140 --> 07:31:13,260
and unembarrassed

27796
07:31:13,260 --> 07:31:13,940
a resolution

27797
07:31:13,940 --> 07:31:14,780
the more necessary

27798
07:31:14,780 --> 07:31:16,460
to be made, but perhaps

27799
07:31:16,460 --> 07:31:16,980
not the more

27800
07:31:16,980 --> 07:31:18,180
easily kept.

27801
07:31:18,200 --> 07:31:18,780
Because she.

27802
07:31:18,780 --> 07:31:19,200
Saw that

27803
07:31:19,200 --> 07:31:19,860
the suspicions

27804
07:31:19,860 --> 07:31:20,700
of the whole party

27805
07:31:20,700 --> 07:31:21,320
were awakened

27806
07:31:21,320 --> 07:31:22,280
against them

27807
07:31:22,280 --> 07:31:22,620
and that

27808
07:31:22,620 --> 07:31:22,880
there was

27809
07:31:22,880 --> 07:31:23,880
scarcely an eye

27810
07:31:23,880 --> 07:31:24,420
which did not

27811
07:31:24,420 --> 07:31:25,340
watch his behavior

27812
07:31:25,340 --> 07:31:26,040
when he first came

27813
07:31:26,040 --> 07:31:27,200
into the room.

27814
07:31:27,200 --> 07:31:28,200
In no countenance

27815
07:31:28,200 --> 07:31:29,420
was attentive curiosity

27816
07:31:29,420 --> 07:31:30,540
so strongly marked

27817
07:31:30,540 --> 07:31:31,740
as in Miss Bingley,

27818
07:31:31,880 --> 07:31:33,080
in spite of the smiles

27819
07:31:33,080 --> 07:31:33,480
which over

27820
07:31:33,480 --> 07:31:34,200
spread her face

27821
07:31:34,200 --> 07:31:34,940
whenever she spoke

27822
07:31:34,940 --> 07:31:36,140
to one of its objects.

27823
07:31:36,440 --> 07:31:37,100
For jealousy,

27824
07:31:37,100 --> 07:31:37,760
had not yet.

27825
07:31:37,760 --> 07:31:38,940
Made her desperate

27826
07:31:38,940 --> 07:31:39,800
and her attentions

27827
07:31:39,800 --> 07:31:40,160
to Mr.

27828
07:31:40,160 --> 07:31:40,880
Darcy were by

27829
07:31:40,880 --> 07:31:42,080
no means over.

27830
07:31:42,380 --> 07:31:43,260
Miss Darcy,

27831
07:31:43,260 --> 07:31:43,880
on her brother's

27832
07:31:43,880 --> 07:31:44,540
entrance,

27833
07:31:44,540 --> 07:31:45,440
exerted herself

27834
07:31:45,440 --> 07:31:46,560
much more to talk.

27835
07:31:46,560 --> 07:31:47,480
And Elizabeth saw

27836
07:31:47,480 --> 07:31:48,380
that he was anxious

27837
07:31:48,380 --> 07:31:49,080
for his sister

27838
07:31:49,080 --> 07:31:49,640
and herself

27839
07:31:49,640 --> 07:31:50,700
to get acquainted.

27840
07:31:50,700 --> 07:31:50,960
And.

27841
07:31:50,960 --> 07:31:51,500
Forward it

27842
07:31:51,500 --> 07:31:52,500
as much as possible.

27843
07:31:52,500 --> 07:31:53,280
Every attempt

27844
07:31:53,280 --> 07:31:54,140
at conversation

27845
07:31:54,140 --> 07:31:55,340
on either side.

27846
07:31:55,560 --> 07:31:56,220
Miss Bingley

27847
07:31:56,220 --> 07:31:56,820
saw all this.

27848
07:31:56,820 --> 07:31:57,660
Likewise.

27849
07:31:57,660 --> 07:31:58,640
And the imprudence

27850
07:31:58,640 --> 07:31:59,400
of anger

27851
07:31:59,400 --> 07:31:59,760
took the

27852
07:31:59,760 --> 07:32:00,720
first opportunity

27853
07:32:00,720 --> 07:32:01,940
of saying with sneering

27854
07:32:01,940 --> 07:32:03,140
civility.

27855
07:32:03,300 --> 07:32:04,760
Pray, Miss Eliza.

27856
07:32:05,060 --> 07:32:06,180
Are not the blank shore

27857
07:32:06,180 --> 07:32:06,620
militia

27858
07:32:06,620 --> 07:32:07,820
removed from Merton.

27859
07:32:08,120 --> 07:32:09,020
They must be

27860
07:32:09,020 --> 07:32:10,200
a great loss

27861
07:32:10,200 --> 07:32:11,460
to your family.

27862
07:32:12,500 --> 07:32:13,220
In Darcy's

27863
07:32:13,220 --> 07:32:13,860
presence, she

27864
07:32:13,860 --> 07:32:14,760
dared not mention

27865
07:32:14,760 --> 07:32:15,780
Wickham's name.

27866
07:32:15,780 --> 07:32:16,940
But Elizabeth instantly

27867
07:32:16,940 --> 07:32:17,640
comprehended

27868
07:32:17,640 --> 07:32:18,620
that he was uppermost

27869
07:32:18,620 --> 07:32:19,620
in her thoughts

27870
07:32:19,620 --> 07:32:19,920
and the

27871
07:32:19,920 --> 07:32:21,200
various recollections

27872
07:32:21,200 --> 07:32:22,040
connected with him

27873
07:32:22,040 --> 07:32:22,860
gave her a moment's

27874
07:32:22,860 --> 07:32:23,780
distress.

27875
07:32:23,780 --> 07:32:24,860
But exerting herself

27876
07:32:24,860 --> 07:32:26,000
vigorously to repel

27877
07:32:26,000 --> 07:32:27,200
the ill natured attack,

27878
07:32:27,420 --> 07:32:28,380
she presently answered

27879
07:32:28,380 --> 07:32:28,880
the question

27880
07:32:28,880 --> 07:32:29,580
in a tolerably

27881
07:32:29,580 --> 07:32:30,780
detached tone.

27882
07:32:31,140 --> 07:32:32,100
While she spoke,

27883
07:32:32,100 --> 07:32:33,420
an involuntary glance

27884
07:32:33,420 --> 07:32:34,520
showed her Darcy

27885
07:32:34,520 --> 07:32:34,820
with a

27886
07:32:34,820 --> 07:32:36,020
heightened complexion,

27887
07:32:36,120 --> 07:32:37,320
earnestly looking at her

27888
07:32:37,560 --> 07:32:38,300
and his sister,

27889
07:32:38,300 --> 07:32:39,540
overcome with confusion

27890
07:32:39,720 --> 07:32:40,440
and unable

27891
07:32:40,440 --> 07:32:41,640
to lift up her eyes.

27892
07:32:41,940 --> 07:32:43,100
Had Miss Bingley known.

27893
07:32:43,100 --> 07:32:43,680
What pain.

27894
07:32:43,680 --> 07:32:44,180
She was then

27895
07:32:44,180 --> 07:32:44,540
giving her

27896
07:32:44,540 --> 07:32:45,600
beloved friend,

27897
07:32:45,600 --> 07:32:46,500
she undoubtedly

27898
07:32:46,500 --> 07:32:47,220
would have refrained

27899
07:32:47,220 --> 07:32:48,200
from the hint.

27900
07:32:48,200 --> 07:32:48,660
But she had.

27901
07:32:48,660 --> 07:32:49,460
Merely intended

27902
07:32:49,460 --> 07:32:50,700
to dispose Elizabeth

27903
07:32:50,700 --> 07:32:51,500
by bringing forward

27904
07:32:51,500 --> 07:32:52,700
the idea of a man.

27905
07:32:52,800 --> 07:32:53,760
To whom she believed.

27906
07:32:53,760 --> 07:32:54,620
Her partial

27907
07:32:54,620 --> 07:32:55,740
and to make her betray

27908
07:32:55,740 --> 07:32:56,520
a sensibility

27909
07:32:56,520 --> 07:32:57,440
which might injure her

27910
07:32:57,440 --> 07:32:58,640
in Dorothy's opinion.

27911
07:32:58,820 --> 07:32:59,580
And perhaps

27912
07:32:59,580 --> 07:33:00,560
to remind the latter

27913
07:33:00,560 --> 07:33:01,440
of all the follies

27914
07:33:01,440 --> 07:33:02,640
and absurdities by which

27915
07:33:02,640 --> 07:33:03,720
some part of her family

27916
07:33:03,720 --> 07:33:04,320
were connected

27917
07:33:04,320 --> 07:33:05,520
with that corps.

27918
07:33:05,640 --> 07:33:06,380
Not a syllable

27919
07:33:06,380 --> 07:33:07,140
had ever reached her

27920
07:33:07,140 --> 07:33:07,400
of Ms..

27921
07:33:07,400 --> 07:33:08,420
Darcy's meditated.

27922
07:33:08,420 --> 07:33:09,680
Elopement to no.

27923
07:33:09,680 --> 07:33:10,160
Creature.

27924
07:33:10,160 --> 07:33:11,180
Had it been revealed

27925
07:33:11,180 --> 07:33:11,840
where secrecy

27926
07:33:11,840 --> 07:33:12,720
was possible

27927
07:33:12,720 --> 07:33:14,000
except to Elizabeth.

27928
07:33:14,340 --> 07:33:15,360
And from all being

27929
07:33:15,360 --> 07:33:16,380
these connections,

27930
07:33:16,380 --> 07:33:16,880
her brother

27931
07:33:16,880 --> 07:33:18,080
was particularly anxious

27932
07:33:18,080 --> 07:33:19,040
to conceal it

27933
07:33:19,040 --> 07:33:20,000
from the very wish

27934
07:33:20,000 --> 07:33:20,600
which Elizabeth

27935
07:33:20,600 --> 07:33:21,200
had long ago

27936
07:33:21,200 --> 07:33:22,280
attributed to him

27937
07:33:22,280 --> 07:33:23,040
of their becoming

27938
07:33:23,040 --> 07:33:24,240
hereafter her own.

27939
07:33:24,680 --> 07:33:25,440
He had certainly

27940
07:33:25,440 --> 07:33:26,640
formed such plan

27941
07:33:26,720 --> 07:33:27,600
and without meeting

27942
07:33:27,600 --> 07:33:28,280
that it should affect

27943
07:33:28,280 --> 07:33:28,800
his endeavor

27944
07:33:28,800 --> 07:33:29,540
to separate him

27945
07:33:29,540 --> 07:33:30,600
from Ms.. Bennett.

27946
07:33:30,600 --> 07:33:31,400
It is probable

27947
07:33:31,400 --> 07:33:32,100
that it might add

27948
07:33:32,100 --> 07:33:32,600
something

27949
07:33:32,600 --> 07:33:33,840
to his lively concern

27950
07:33:33,840 --> 07:33:34,520
for the welfare

27951
07:33:34,520 --> 07:33:35,540
of his friend.

27952
07:33:35,540 --> 07:33:36,660
Elizabeth's

27953
07:33:36,660 --> 07:33:37,760
behavior, however, soon

27954
07:33:37,760 --> 07:33:38,960
quieted his emotion,

27955
07:33:39,240 --> 07:33:40,460
and as Miss Bingley,

27956
07:33:40,460 --> 07:33:42,020
vexed and disappointed,

27957
07:33:42,260 --> 07:33:43,220
dared not approach

27958
07:33:43,220 --> 07:33:44,420
near to Wickham.

27959
07:33:44,420 --> 07:33:45,440
Georgiana also

27960
07:33:45,440 --> 07:33:46,640
recovered in time.

27961
07:33:46,700 --> 07:33:47,460
Though not enough.

27962
07:33:47,460 --> 07:33:47,820
To be able

27963
07:33:47,820 --> 07:33:49,020
to speak anymore.

27964
07:33:49,320 --> 07:33:49,820
Her brother,

27965
07:33:49,820 --> 07:33:50,340
whose eyes

27966
07:33:50,340 --> 07:33:51,440
she feared to meet,

27967
07:33:51,440 --> 07:33:52,460
scarcely recollected

27968
07:33:52,460 --> 07:33:53,040
her interest

27969
07:33:53,040 --> 07:33:53,940
in the affair

27970
07:33:53,940 --> 07:33:54,260
and the

27971
07:33:54,260 --> 07:33:55,200
very circumstance

27972
07:33:55,200 --> 07:33:56,060
which had been

27973
07:33:56,060 --> 07:33:56,900
to turn his thoughts

27974
07:33:56,900 --> 07:33:57,680
from Elizabeth

27975
07:33:57,680 --> 07:33:58,320
seem to have

27976
07:33:58,320 --> 07:33:59,760
fixed them on her more

27977
07:33:59,760 --> 07:34:00,900
and more cheerfully.

27978
07:34:01,860 --> 07:34:02,100
Their

27979
07:34:02,100 --> 07:34:03,360
visit did not continue

27980
07:34:03,360 --> 07:34:04,340
long after the question

27981
07:34:04,340 --> 07:34:04,880
and answer

27982
07:34:04,880 --> 07:34:05,840
above mentioned,

27983
07:34:05,840 --> 07:34:06,620
and while Mr.

27984
07:34:06,620 --> 07:34:07,020
Darcy

27985
07:34:07,020 --> 07:34:07,760
was attending them

27986
07:34:07,760 --> 07:34:08,780
to their carriage,

27987
07:34:08,780 --> 07:34:09,920
Miss Bingley was venting

27988
07:34:09,920 --> 07:34:10,460
her feelings

27989
07:34:10,460 --> 07:34:11,300
and criticisms

27990
07:34:11,300 --> 07:34:12,480
on Elizabeth's person,

27991
07:34:12,480 --> 07:34:13,760
behavior and dress.

27992
07:34:14,240 --> 07:34:15,140
But Georgiana

27993
07:34:15,140 --> 07:34:16,260
would not her.

27994
07:34:16,260 --> 07:34:16,820
Her brother's

27995
07:34:16,820 --> 07:34:17,540
recommendation

27996
07:34:17,540 --> 07:34:18,000
was enough

27997
07:34:18,000 --> 07:34:19,200
to ensure her favor.

27998
07:34:19,320 --> 07:34:20,160
His judgment

27999
07:34:20,160 --> 07:34:21,360
could not her.

28000
07:34:21,440 --> 07:34:22,560
And as he had spoken

28001
07:34:22,560 --> 07:34:23,000
in such

28002
07:34:23,000 --> 07:34:23,960
terms of Elizabeth,

28003
07:34:23,960 --> 07:34:25,140
asked to leave Georgiana

28004
07:34:25,140 --> 07:34:25,920
without the power

28005
07:34:25,920 --> 07:34:27,140
of finding her otherwise

28006
07:34:27,140 --> 07:34:28,580
then lovely and amiable.

28007
07:34:29,100 --> 07:34:30,140
When Darcy returned

28008
07:34:30,140 --> 07:34:31,340
to the saloon, Ms..

28009
07:34:31,360 --> 07:34:31,700
Bingley

28010
07:34:31,700 --> 07:34:32,280
could not help

28011
07:34:32,280 --> 07:34:33,020
repeating to him

28012
07:34:33,020 --> 07:34:33,540
some part

28013
07:34:33,540 --> 07:34:34,080
of what she had

28014
07:34:34,080 --> 07:34:34,580
been saying

28015
07:34:34,580 --> 07:34:35,780
to his sister.

28016
07:34:36,120 --> 07:34:37,020
How very ill

28017
07:34:37,020 --> 07:34:37,860
measles had been.

28018
07:34:37,860 --> 07:34:38,540
It looks this

28019
07:34:38,540 --> 07:34:39,200
morning, Mr.

28020
07:34:39,200 --> 07:34:40,080
Darcy.

28021
07:34:40,080 --> 07:34:41,120
She cried.

28022
07:34:41,120 --> 07:34:42,200
I never in my life

28023
07:34:42,200 --> 07:34:42,780
saw anyone

28024
07:34:42,780 --> 07:34:43,800
so much altered

28025
07:34:43,800 --> 07:34:44,220
as she is

28026
07:34:44,220 --> 07:34:45,360
since the winter.

28027
07:34:45,360 --> 07:34:46,760
She's grown so brown

28028
07:34:46,760 --> 07:34:47,960
and coarse.

28029
07:34:48,120 --> 07:34:48,900
Louisa and

28030
07:34:48,900 --> 07:34:49,620
I were agreeing

28031
07:34:49,620 --> 07:34:50,160
that we should not

28032
07:34:50,160 --> 07:34:51,360
have known her again.

28033
07:34:52,020 --> 07:34:53,000
However, little Mr.

28034
07:34:53,000 --> 07:34:53,640
Darcy might have

28035
07:34:53,640 --> 07:34:54,840
liked such an address.

28036
07:34:55,020 --> 07:34:55,680
He contended.

28037
07:34:55,680 --> 07:34:56,220
Himself with

28038
07:34:56,220 --> 07:34:57,140
coolly replying

28039
07:34:57,140 --> 07:34:57,740
that he perceived

28040
07:34:57,740 --> 07:34:58,940
no other alteration

28041
07:34:58,940 --> 07:34:59,180
than her

28042
07:34:59,180 --> 07:35:00,380
being rather tanned.

28043
07:35:00,500 --> 07:35:01,380
No miraculous

28044
07:35:01,380 --> 07:35:01,980
consequence

28045
07:35:01,980 --> 07:35:02,540
of traveling

28046
07:35:02,540 --> 07:35:03,740
in the summer.

28047
07:35:03,980 --> 07:35:05,180
2 million.

28048
07:35:05,420 --> 07:35:06,480
She rejoined.

28049
07:35:06,480 --> 07:35:07,380
I must confess

28050
07:35:07,380 --> 07:35:08,220
that I never saw

28051
07:35:08,220 --> 07:35:09,380
any beauty in her.

28052
07:35:09,380 --> 07:35:10,800
Her face is too thin.

28053
07:35:11,040 --> 07:35:11,880
Her complexion

28054
07:35:11,880 --> 07:35:13,080
has no brilliancy

28055
07:35:13,140 --> 07:35:13,860
and features

28056
07:35:13,860 --> 07:35:15,060
and not at handsome.

28057
07:35:15,360 --> 07:35:16,380
Her nose wants

28058
07:35:16,380 --> 07:35:17,160
character.

28059
07:35:17,160 --> 07:35:18,500
There is nothing marked

28060
07:35:18,500 --> 07:35:19,700
in its lines.

28061
07:35:19,740 --> 07:35:21,180
Her teeth are tolerable,

28062
07:35:21,500 --> 07:35:22,220
but not out of

28063
07:35:22,220 --> 07:35:23,420
the common way.

28064
07:35:23,540 --> 07:35:24,980
And for her eyes,

28065
07:35:25,260 --> 07:35:26,580
which have sometimes

28066
07:35:26,580 --> 07:35:28,160
been called so fine,

28067
07:35:28,440 --> 07:35:29,120
I could never

28068
07:35:29,120 --> 07:35:29,580
see anything

28069
07:35:29,580 --> 07:35:30,780
extraordinary in them.

28070
07:35:30,920 --> 07:35:31,980
They have a sharp,

28071
07:35:31,980 --> 07:35:32,940
shrewish look,

28072
07:35:32,940 --> 07:35:33,360
which I do

28073
07:35:33,360 --> 07:35:34,560
not like at all.

28074
07:35:34,740 --> 07:35:35,600
And in her hair

28075
07:35:35,600 --> 07:35:36,140
altogether,

28076
07:35:36,140 --> 07:35:36,420
there is

28077
07:35:36,420 --> 07:35:37,400
a self-sufficiency

28078
07:35:37,400 --> 07:35:38,180
without fashion,

28079
07:35:38,180 --> 07:35:39,780
which is intolerable.

28080
07:35:40,880 --> 07:35:41,880
Persuaded as Miss

28081
07:35:41,880 --> 07:35:43,100
Bingley was, that Darcy

28082
07:35:43,100 --> 07:35:44,300
admired.

28083
07:35:44,300 --> 07:35:45,080
This was not.

28084
07:35:45,080 --> 07:35:45,840
The best method of

28085
07:35:45,840 --> 07:35:47,040
recommending herself.

28086
07:35:47,220 --> 07:35:47,820
But angry

28087
07:35:47,820 --> 07:35:48,240
people are

28088
07:35:48,240 --> 07:35:49,440
not always wise.

28089
07:35:49,560 --> 07:35:49,920
And in.

28090
07:35:49,920 --> 07:35:50,340
Seeing him

28091
07:35:50,340 --> 07:35:51,000
at last, looks.

28092
07:35:51,000 --> 07:35:52,140
Somewhat nettled.

28093
07:35:52,140 --> 07:35:53,480
She had all the success

28094
07:35:53,480 --> 07:35:54,680
she expected.

28095
07:35:54,740 --> 07:35:55,080
He was

28096
07:35:55,080 --> 07:35:56,000
resolutely silent,

28097
07:35:56,000 --> 07:35:56,660
however,

28098
07:35:56,660 --> 07:35:57,180
and from a

28099
07:35:57,180 --> 07:35:57,920
determination of.

28100
07:35:57,920 --> 07:35:58,920
Making him speak,

28101
07:35:58,920 --> 07:36:00,020
she continued.

28102
07:36:00,020 --> 07:36:01,380
I remember when we first

28103
07:36:01,380 --> 07:36:01,800
knew her

28104
07:36:01,800 --> 07:36:02,900
in Hertfordshire.

28105
07:36:02,900 --> 07:36:04,560
How we all were to find

28106
07:36:04,560 --> 07:36:05,000
that she was a

28107
07:36:05,000 --> 07:36:06,200
reputed beauty.

28108
07:36:06,480 --> 07:36:06,860
And I

28109
07:36:06,860 --> 07:36:08,100
particularly recollect

28110
07:36:08,100 --> 07:36:09,360
your saying one night

28111
07:36:09,360 --> 07:36:09,900
after they had

28112
07:36:09,900 --> 07:36:10,560
been dining

28113
07:36:10,560 --> 07:36:11,600
at Netherfield,

28114
07:36:11,600 --> 07:36:13,080
she a beauty.

28115
07:36:13,440 --> 07:36:14,420
I should as soon

28116
07:36:14,420 --> 07:36:15,840
call her mother a wit.

28117
07:36:16,580 --> 07:36:17,400
But afterwards,

28118
07:36:17,400 --> 07:36:17,760
she seemed

28119
07:36:17,760 --> 07:36:18,960
to improve on you.

28120
07:36:18,980 --> 07:36:19,620
And I believe

28121
07:36:19,620 --> 07:36:20,000
you thought her

28122
07:36:20,000 --> 07:36:20,700
rather prettier

28123
07:36:20,700 --> 07:36:21,900
at one time.

28124
07:36:22,220 --> 07:36:24,560
Yes, replied Darcy,

28125
07:36:24,600 --> 07:36:24,900
who could

28126
07:36:24,900 --> 07:36:25,640
contain himself

28127
07:36:25,640 --> 07:36:26,180
no longer.

28128
07:36:27,320 --> 07:36:28,080
But that was only

28129
07:36:28,080 --> 07:36:29,280
when I first knew her.

28130
07:36:29,880 --> 07:36:30,800
For it is many months

28131
07:36:30,800 --> 07:36:31,260
since I have

28132
07:36:31,260 --> 07:36:31,980
considered her

28133
07:36:31,980 --> 07:36:33,480
as one of the women

28134
07:36:33,480 --> 07:36:34,680
of my acquaintance.

28135
07:36:35,960 --> 07:36:37,160
He then went away

28136
07:36:37,260 --> 07:36:38,100
and Miss Bingley

28137
07:36:38,100 --> 07:36:38,460
was left

28138
07:36:38,460 --> 07:36:38,640
to do

28139
07:36:38,640 --> 07:36:39,600
all the satisfaction

28140
07:36:39,600 --> 07:36:39,900
of having

28141
07:36:39,900 --> 07:36:40,800
forced him to say,

28142
07:36:40,800 --> 07:36:41,540
which gave no one

28143
07:36:41,540 --> 07:36:42,960
any pain but herself.

28144
07:36:43,920 --> 07:36:44,280
Mrs.

28145
07:36:44,280 --> 07:36:44,720
Gardiner

28146
07:36:44,720 --> 07:36:45,360
and Elizabeth

28147
07:36:45,360 --> 07:36:45,980
talked of all

28148
07:36:45,980 --> 07:36:46,680
that had occurred

28149
07:36:46,680 --> 07:36:47,700
during their visit

28150
07:36:47,700 --> 07:36:48,900
as they returned.

28151
07:36:48,920 --> 07:36:49,520
Except what.

28152
07:36:49,520 --> 07:36:50,240
Had particularly

28153
07:36:50,240 --> 07:36:50,900
interested them.

28154
07:36:50,900 --> 07:36:51,720
Both.

28155
07:36:51,720 --> 07:36:52,400
The look.

28156
07:36:52,400 --> 07:36:53,540
Behavior of everybody

28157
07:36:53,540 --> 07:36:54,080
they had seen

28158
07:36:54,080 --> 07:36:55,040
were discussed.

28159
07:36:55,040 --> 07:36:55,520
Except.

28160
07:36:55,520 --> 07:36:56,100
Of the person

28161
07:36:56,100 --> 07:36:57,140
who had mostly engaged

28162
07:36:57,140 --> 07:36:58,260
their attention.

28163
07:36:58,260 --> 07:36:58,800
They talked

28164
07:36:58,800 --> 07:36:59,600
of his sister,

28165
07:36:59,600 --> 07:37:00,540
his friends,

28166
07:37:00,540 --> 07:37:01,560
his house, his.

28167
07:37:01,560 --> 07:37:02,460
Fruit of.

28168
07:37:02,460 --> 07:37:03,800
Everything but himself.

28169
07:37:04,220 --> 07:37:04,980
Yet Elizabeth

28170
07:37:04,980 --> 07:37:05,940
was longing to know

28171
07:37:05,940 --> 07:37:06,320
what Mrs.

28172
07:37:06,320 --> 07:37:07,520
Gardiner thought of him,

28173
07:37:07,620 --> 07:37:08,160
and Mrs.

28174
07:37:08,160 --> 07:37:09,000
Gardiner would have been

28175
07:37:09,000 --> 07:37:10,260
highly gratified by her

28176
07:37:10,260 --> 07:37:11,180
niece's beginning

28177
07:37:11,180 --> 07:37:11,880
the subject

28178
07:37:13,940 --> 07:37:15,140
Chapter 46.

28179
07:37:16,160 --> 07:37:16,860
Elizabeth had

28180
07:37:16,860 --> 07:37:17,580
been a good deal

28181
07:37:17,580 --> 07:37:18,380
disappointed in

28182
07:37:18,380 --> 07:37:19,320
not finding a letter

28183
07:37:19,320 --> 07:37:19,920
from Jane

28184
07:37:19,920 --> 07:37:20,820
on their first arrival

28185
07:37:20,820 --> 07:37:21,800
at Lambton.

28186
07:37:21,800 --> 07:37:22,880
And this disappointment

28187
07:37:22,880 --> 07:37:23,600
had been renewed

28188
07:37:23,600 --> 07:37:24,540
on each of the mornings

28189
07:37:24,540 --> 07:37:24,980
that had now

28190
07:37:24,980 --> 07:37:26,180
been spent there.

28191
07:37:26,180 --> 07:37:27,120
But on the third,

28192
07:37:27,120 --> 07:37:28,320
her opining was over

28193
07:37:28,440 --> 07:37:29,780
and her sister justified

28194
07:37:29,960 --> 07:37:30,600
by the receipt

28195
07:37:30,600 --> 07:37:31,320
of two letters

28196
07:37:31,320 --> 07:37:32,820
from her at once on

28197
07:37:32,820 --> 07:37:33,800
one of which was marked

28198
07:37:33,800 --> 07:37:34,480
that it had been mis

28199
07:37:34,480 --> 07:37:35,680
sent elsewhere.

28200
07:37:36,000 --> 07:37:36,600
Elizabeth was

28201
07:37:36,600 --> 07:37:37,800
not surprised at it.

28202
07:37:37,940 --> 07:37:38,940
As Jane had written,

28203
07:37:38,940 --> 07:37:39,600
the direction

28204
07:37:39,600 --> 07:37:40,800
remarkably ill.

28205
07:37:41,540 --> 07:37:42,140
They had just

28206
07:37:42,140 --> 07:37:43,160
been preparing to walk

28207
07:37:43,160 --> 07:37:44,360
as the letters came in

28208
07:37:44,460 --> 07:37:45,680
and her uncle and aunt

28209
07:37:45,720 --> 07:37:46,220
leaving her

28210
07:37:46,220 --> 07:37:47,420
to enjoy them in quiet

28211
07:37:47,540 --> 07:37:48,900
set off by themselves.

28212
07:37:49,320 --> 07:37:50,580
The one miss sent must

28213
07:37:50,580 --> 07:37:51,780
first be attended to.

28214
07:37:51,980 --> 07:37:52,800
It had been written

28215
07:37:52,800 --> 07:37:54,000
five days ago.

28216
07:37:54,080 --> 07:37:54,620
The beginning.

28217
07:37:54,620 --> 07:37:55,460
Contained an account

28218
07:37:55,460 --> 07:37:55,860
of all their

28219
07:37:55,860 --> 07:37:56,480
little parties

28220
07:37:56,480 --> 07:37:57,420
and engagements.

28221
07:37:57,420 --> 07:37:57,960
With such.

28222
07:37:57,960 --> 07:37:58,500
News as the

28223
07:37:58,500 --> 07:37:59,700
country afforded

28224
07:37:59,720 --> 07:38:00,920
but the latter half

28225
07:38:00,920 --> 07:38:02,120
was dated a day later

28226
07:38:02,300 --> 07:38:02,780
and written

28227
07:38:02,780 --> 07:38:04,040
in evident agitation.

28228
07:38:04,280 --> 07:38:04,520
Gave.

28229
07:38:04,520 --> 07:38:05,340
More important

28230
07:38:05,340 --> 07:38:06,440
intelligence.

28231
07:38:06,440 --> 07:38:07,800
It was to this effect

28232
07:38:08,720 --> 07:38:09,800
since writing the above

28233
07:38:09,800 --> 07:38:10,160
Dearest.

28234
07:38:10,160 --> 07:38:10,760
Lizzie,

28235
07:38:10,760 --> 07:38:11,720
something has occurred

28236
07:38:11,720 --> 07:38:12,960
of a most unexpected

28237
07:38:12,960 --> 07:38:14,160
and serious nature.

28238
07:38:14,720 --> 07:38:15,380
But I am afraid

28239
07:38:15,380 --> 07:38:15,860
of alarming.

28240
07:38:15,860 --> 07:38:17,000
You be assured

28241
07:38:17,000 --> 07:38:18,200
that we are all well.

28242
07:38:18,380 --> 07:38:19,340
What I have to say

28243
07:38:19,340 --> 07:38:20,540
relates to poor Lydia.

28244
07:38:20,940 --> 07:38:22,520
An express came at 12

28245
07:38:22,520 --> 07:38:23,840
last night, just as

28246
07:38:23,840 --> 07:38:25,040
we were all gone to bed

28247
07:38:25,320 --> 07:38:26,520
from Colonel Foresta

28248
07:38:26,820 --> 07:38:27,600
to inform us

28249
07:38:27,600 --> 07:38:28,380
that she was going off

28250
07:38:28,380 --> 07:38:29,180
to Scotland

28251
07:38:29,180 --> 07:38:29,640
with one of

28252
07:38:29,640 --> 07:38:30,660
his officers.

28253
07:38:30,660 --> 07:38:31,860
To own the truth

28254
07:38:31,920 --> 07:38:33,120
with Wickham.

28255
07:38:33,260 --> 07:38:34,640
Imagine our surprise

28256
07:38:35,220 --> 07:38:35,820
to Kitty.

28257
07:38:35,820 --> 07:38:36,140
However,

28258
07:38:36,140 --> 07:38:36,740
it does not seem

28259
07:38:36,740 --> 07:38:38,000
so wholly unexpected.

28260
07:38:38,600 --> 07:38:39,360
I am very,

28261
07:38:39,360 --> 07:38:40,560
very sorry.

28262
07:38:40,680 --> 07:38:41,620
So imprudent

28263
07:38:41,620 --> 07:38:43,080
to match on both sides.

28264
07:38:43,640 --> 07:38:44,700
But I am willing to hope

28265
07:38:44,700 --> 07:38:45,420
the best

28266
07:38:45,420 --> 07:38:46,460
and that his character

28267
07:38:46,460 --> 07:38:47,660
is being misunderstood,

28268
07:38:48,000 --> 07:38:48,620
thoughtless

28269
07:38:48,620 --> 07:38:49,460
and indiscreet.

28270
07:38:49,460 --> 07:38:49,800
I can

28271
07:38:49,800 --> 07:38:51,000
easily believe him.

28272
07:38:51,140 --> 07:38:52,340
But this step

28273
07:38:52,400 --> 07:38:53,240
and that is rejoice

28274
07:38:53,240 --> 07:38:54,440
over it, marks

28275
07:38:54,440 --> 07:38:55,740
nothing bad at heart.

28276
07:38:56,180 --> 07:38:56,780
His choice

28277
07:38:56,780 --> 07:38:57,480
is disinterested,

28278
07:38:57,480 --> 07:38:58,380
at least for

28279
07:38:58,380 --> 07:38:58,980
he must know.

28280
07:38:58,980 --> 07:38:59,420
My father

28281
07:38:59,420 --> 07:39:00,620
can give her nothing.

28282
07:39:00,720 --> 07:39:01,640
A poor mother is

28283
07:39:01,640 --> 07:39:02,840
sadly grieved.

28284
07:39:02,880 --> 07:39:03,840
My father Bassett.

28285
07:39:03,840 --> 07:39:04,740
Better.

28286
07:39:04,740 --> 07:39:05,540
How thankful.

28287
07:39:05,540 --> 07:39:06,240
My that we never.

28288
07:39:06,240 --> 07:39:06,840
Let them know

28289
07:39:06,840 --> 07:39:07,400
what has been said

28290
07:39:07,400 --> 07:39:08,300
against him.

28291
07:39:08,300 --> 07:39:09,060
We must forget

28292
07:39:09,060 --> 07:39:10,260
it ourselves.

28293
07:39:10,400 --> 07:39:10,920
They were off.

28294
07:39:10,920 --> 07:39:11,500
Saturday night

28295
07:39:11,500 --> 07:39:12,260
at about 12,

28296
07:39:12,260 --> 07:39:13,460
as is conjectured.

28297
07:39:13,500 --> 07:39:14,040
But were not.

28298
07:39:14,040 --> 07:39:15,120
Missed till yesterday

28299
07:39:15,120 --> 07:39:15,560
morning at.

28300
07:39:15,560 --> 07:39:16,380
Eight.

28301
07:39:16,380 --> 07:39:17,220
The express was

28302
07:39:17,220 --> 07:39:18,420
sent off directly.

28303
07:39:18,800 --> 07:39:19,700
My dear Lizzie,

28304
07:39:19,700 --> 07:39:20,520
they must have passed

28305
07:39:20,520 --> 07:39:21,780
within ten miles of us.

28306
07:39:22,220 --> 07:39:23,400
Colonel Foster gives us.

28307
07:39:23,400 --> 07:39:24,360
Reason to expect him.

28308
07:39:24,360 --> 07:39:25,380
Here soon.

28309
07:39:25,380 --> 07:39:26,100
Lydia left

28310
07:39:26,100 --> 07:39:26,700
a few lines

28311
07:39:26,700 --> 07:39:27,500
for his wife,

28312
07:39:27,500 --> 07:39:28,160
informing her

28313
07:39:28,160 --> 07:39:29,360
of their intention.

28314
07:39:29,460 --> 07:39:30,540
I Must conclude for

28315
07:39:30,540 --> 07:39:31,260
I cannot be long

28316
07:39:31,260 --> 07:39:32,460
for my poor mother.

28317
07:39:32,700 --> 07:39:33,340
I am afraid

28318
07:39:33,340 --> 07:39:33,720
you will not

28319
07:39:33,720 --> 07:39:34,920
be able to make it out.

28320
07:39:34,920 --> 07:39:35,840
But I hardly know

28321
07:39:35,840 --> 07:39:37,040
what I've written.

28322
07:39:37,320 --> 07:39:38,520
Without allowing herself

28323
07:39:38,520 --> 07:39:39,720
time for consideration

28324
07:39:39,860 --> 07:39:40,560
and scarcely

28325
07:39:40,560 --> 07:39:41,760
knowing what she felt.

28326
07:39:41,880 --> 07:39:42,660
Elizabeth, on

28327
07:39:42,660 --> 07:39:43,560
finishing this letter,

28328
07:39:43,560 --> 07:39:44,060
instantly

28329
07:39:44,060 --> 07:39:45,120
seized the other

28330
07:39:45,120 --> 07:39:45,860
and opening it

28331
07:39:45,860 --> 07:39:46,620
with the utmost

28332
07:39:46,620 --> 07:39:47,460
impatience.

28333
07:39:47,460 --> 07:39:48,660
Read as follows.

28334
07:39:48,780 --> 07:39:49,560
It had been written

28335
07:39:49,560 --> 07:39:50,400
a day later than

28336
07:39:50,400 --> 07:39:50,960
the conclusion

28337
07:39:50,960 --> 07:39:51,660
of the first.

28338
07:39:52,620 --> 07:39:53,060
By this

28339
07:39:53,060 --> 07:39:54,300
time, my dearest sister.

28340
07:39:54,480 --> 07:39:55,220
You have received

28341
07:39:55,220 --> 07:39:56,420
my horrid letter.

28342
07:39:56,540 --> 07:39:57,420
I wish this may

28343
07:39:57,420 --> 07:39:58,620
be more intelligible.

28344
07:39:58,680 --> 07:40:00,380
But though not for time,

28345
07:40:00,600 --> 07:40:02,280
my head is so bewildered

28346
07:40:02,280 --> 07:40:03,200
that I cannot answer

28347
07:40:03,200 --> 07:40:04,400
for being coherent.

28348
07:40:04,820 --> 07:40:06,020
Dearest Lizzie,

28349
07:40:06,060 --> 07:40:06,720
I hardly know

28350
07:40:06,720 --> 07:40:07,920
what I would write.

28351
07:40:07,980 --> 07:40:09,000
But I have bad

28352
07:40:09,000 --> 07:40:09,800
news for you.

28353
07:40:09,800 --> 07:40:10,460
And it cannot

28354
07:40:10,460 --> 07:40:11,580
be delayed.

28355
07:40:11,580 --> 07:40:12,200
Imprudent

28356
07:40:12,200 --> 07:40:12,860
as the marriage

28357
07:40:12,860 --> 07:40:13,340
between Mr.

28358
07:40:13,340 --> 07:40:13,620
Wickham

28359
07:40:13,620 --> 07:40:14,820
and our polity would be,

28360
07:40:15,120 --> 07:40:16,140
we are now anxious

28361
07:40:16,140 --> 07:40:16,760
to be assured

28362
07:40:16,760 --> 07:40:17,960
that it has taken place.

28363
07:40:18,080 --> 07:40:19,040
But there is much too,

28364
07:40:19,040 --> 07:40:20,040
much reason to fear

28365
07:40:20,040 --> 07:40:20,640
they are not

28366
07:40:20,640 --> 07:40:21,840
gone to Scotland.

28367
07:40:21,920 --> 07:40:23,040
Colonel Foster came

28368
07:40:23,040 --> 07:40:24,480
yesterday, having left

28369
07:40:24,480 --> 07:40:25,680
Brighton the day before.

28370
07:40:25,920 --> 07:40:26,760
Not too many hours.

28371
07:40:26,760 --> 07:40:27,120
After the.

28372
07:40:27,120 --> 07:40:28,260
Express.

28373
07:40:28,260 --> 07:40:29,220
Though Lydia's short

28374
07:40:29,220 --> 07:40:29,640
letter to.

28375
07:40:29,640 --> 07:40:29,940
Mrs.

28376
07:40:29,940 --> 07:40:30,540
F gave them

28377
07:40:30,540 --> 07:40:31,100
to understand

28378
07:40:31,100 --> 07:40:31,620
that they were going

28379
07:40:31,620 --> 07:40:32,640
to Grafton GREENE.

28380
07:40:32,640 --> 07:40:33,560
Something was dropped

28381
07:40:33,560 --> 07:40:34,200
by Danny

28382
07:40:34,200 --> 07:40:35,160
expressing his belief

28383
07:40:35,160 --> 07:40:35,880
that W.

28384
07:40:35,880 --> 07:40:36,540
Never intended

28385
07:40:36,540 --> 07:40:37,160
to go there

28386
07:40:37,160 --> 07:40:38,100
or to marry Lydia

28387
07:40:38,100 --> 07:40:38,760
at all,

28388
07:40:38,760 --> 07:40:39,620
which was repeated

28389
07:40:39,620 --> 07:40:40,860
to Colonel F, who

28390
07:40:40,860 --> 07:40:41,340
instantly

28391
07:40:41,340 --> 07:40:42,600
taking the alarm set off

28392
07:40:42,600 --> 07:40:43,040
from B

28393
07:40:43,040 --> 07:40:43,520
intending to

28394
07:40:43,520 --> 07:40:44,700
trace their out.

28395
07:40:44,700 --> 07:40:45,660
He did trace them

28396
07:40:45,660 --> 07:40:46,820
easily to Clapham,

28397
07:40:46,820 --> 07:40:48,240
but no further for on.

28398
07:40:48,240 --> 07:40:49,340
Entering that place.

28399
07:40:49,340 --> 07:40:49,880
They removed

28400
07:40:49,880 --> 07:40:51,080
into a Hackney coach

28401
07:40:51,120 --> 07:40:52,320
and dismissed the shares

28402
07:40:52,320 --> 07:40:52,760
that brought

28403
07:40:52,760 --> 07:40:53,960
them from Epsom.

28404
07:40:54,000 --> 07:40:54,900
All that is known

28405
07:40:54,900 --> 07:40:55,440
after this

28406
07:40:55,440 --> 07:40:56,600
is that they were seen

28407
07:40:56,600 --> 07:40:57,140
to continue

28408
07:40:57,140 --> 07:40:58,340
the London Road.

28409
07:40:58,560 --> 07:40:58,920
I know

28410
07:40:58,920 --> 07:41:00,120
not what to think.

28411
07:41:00,200 --> 07:41:01,020
After making

28412
07:41:01,020 --> 07:41:02,240
every possible inquiry

28413
07:41:02,240 --> 07:41:03,440
on that side of London,

28414
07:41:03,560 --> 07:41:04,280
Colonel F

28415
07:41:04,280 --> 07:41:04,680
came on

28416
07:41:04,680 --> 07:41:05,780
into Hertfordshire,

28417
07:41:05,780 --> 07:41:06,840
anxiously renewing.

28418
07:41:06,840 --> 07:41:07,320
Them at all

28419
07:41:07,320 --> 07:41:08,240
the turnpikes.

28420
07:41:08,240 --> 07:41:08,600
And all

28421
07:41:08,600 --> 07:41:09,680
the ends in Barnet,

28422
07:41:09,680 --> 07:41:10,760
in Hatfield, but.

28423
07:41:10,760 --> 07:41:11,960
Without any success.

28424
07:41:12,260 --> 07:41:13,220
No such people.

28425
07:41:13,220 --> 07:41:14,280
Had been seen to pass.

28426
07:41:14,280 --> 07:41:15,080
Through

28427
07:41:15,080 --> 07:41:15,360
with the

28428
07:41:15,360 --> 07:41:16,400
kindest concern.

28429
07:41:16,400 --> 07:41:17,640
He came on to London

28430
07:41:17,780 --> 07:41:18,300
and broke

28431
07:41:18,300 --> 07:41:19,140
his apprehensions

28432
07:41:19,140 --> 07:41:19,920
to us in a manner

28433
07:41:19,920 --> 07:41:20,660
most creditable

28434
07:41:20,660 --> 07:41:21,800
to his heart.

28435
07:41:21,800 --> 07:41:22,760
I am sincerely

28436
07:41:22,760 --> 07:41:23,780
grieved for him and.

28437
07:41:23,780 --> 07:41:24,480
Mrs. F.

28438
07:41:24,480 --> 07:41:25,380
But no one can throw

28439
07:41:25,380 --> 07:41:26,580
any blame on them.

28440
07:41:26,940 --> 07:41:27,960
Our distress,

28441
07:41:27,960 --> 07:41:28,400
Dear Lizzie,

28442
07:41:28,400 --> 07:41:29,600
is very great.

28443
07:41:29,900 --> 07:41:30,920
My father and mother

28444
07:41:30,920 --> 07:41:32,120
believe the worst.

28445
07:41:32,120 --> 07:41:33,240
But I cannot think

28446
07:41:33,240 --> 07:41:34,440
so ill of him.

28447
07:41:34,440 --> 07:41:35,700
Many circumstances.

28448
07:41:35,700 --> 07:41:36,200
Might make it

28449
07:41:36,200 --> 07:41:36,860
more eligible

28450
07:41:36,860 --> 07:41:37,220
for them to.

28451
07:41:37,220 --> 07:41:38,660
Be married in town

28452
07:41:38,840 --> 07:41:39,480
than to pursue

28453
07:41:39,480 --> 07:41:40,680
that first plan.

28454
07:41:40,820 --> 07:41:41,960
And even if he could

28455
07:41:41,960 --> 07:41:42,900
form such a design.

28456
07:41:42,900 --> 07:41:43,760
Against a young woman

28457
07:41:43,760 --> 07:41:44,900
of Lydia's connections.

28458
07:41:44,900 --> 07:41:46,100
Which is not likely,

28459
07:41:46,340 --> 07:41:47,340
can I suppose her

28460
07:41:47,340 --> 07:41:48,560
so lost to everything?

28461
07:41:48,960 --> 07:41:50,160
Impossible.

28462
07:41:50,360 --> 07:41:51,440
I grieve to find

28463
07:41:51,440 --> 07:41:52,440
whoever the Colonel F

28464
07:41:52,440 --> 07:41:53,240
is not disposed

28465
07:41:53,240 --> 07:41:53,700
to depend

28466
07:41:53,700 --> 07:41:54,740
upon their marriage.

28467
07:41:54,740 --> 07:41:55,580
He shook his head

28468
07:41:55,580 --> 07:41:56,240
when I expressed

28469
07:41:56,240 --> 07:41:57,060
my hopes

28470
07:41:57,060 --> 07:41:58,260
and said he feared W

28471
07:41:58,260 --> 07:41:58,800
was not a man

28472
07:41:58,800 --> 07:42:00,000
to be trusted.

28473
07:42:00,080 --> 07:42:00,540
My poor

28474
07:42:00,540 --> 07:42:01,520
mother is really ill

28475
07:42:01,520 --> 07:42:02,720
and keeps her room.

28476
07:42:02,840 --> 07:42:03,920
Could she exert herself?

28477
07:42:03,920 --> 07:42:04,980
It would be better.

28478
07:42:04,980 --> 07:42:05,580
But this is not

28479
07:42:05,580 --> 07:42:06,780
to be expected

28480
07:42:06,780 --> 07:42:07,920
and to my father,

28481
07:42:07,920 --> 07:42:08,520
I never in

28482
07:42:08,520 --> 07:42:09,360
my life saw him

28483
07:42:09,360 --> 07:42:10,560
so affected.

28484
07:42:10,680 --> 07:42:12,060
Poor Kitty has anger

28485
07:42:12,060 --> 07:42:12,420
for having

28486
07:42:12,420 --> 07:42:12,920
concealed their

28487
07:42:12,920 --> 07:42:13,820
attachment.

28488
07:42:13,820 --> 07:42:14,720
But as it was a matter

28489
07:42:14,720 --> 07:42:15,440
of confidence,

28490
07:42:15,440 --> 07:42:16,640
one cannot wonder.

28491
07:42:17,240 --> 07:42:18,360
I am truly glad.

28492
07:42:18,360 --> 07:42:19,020
Dearest Lizzie,

28493
07:42:19,020 --> 07:42:19,340
that you have

28494
07:42:19,340 --> 07:42:19,880
been spared

28495
07:42:19,880 --> 07:42:20,520
something of these

28496
07:42:20,520 --> 07:42:21,720
distressing scenes.

28497
07:42:21,920 --> 07:42:23,100
But now, as the first

28498
07:42:23,100 --> 07:42:24,200
shock is over,

28499
07:42:24,200 --> 07:42:24,920
shall I own that?

28500
07:42:24,920 --> 07:42:26,120
I long for your return.

28501
07:42:26,640 --> 07:42:27,660
I am not so selfish,

28502
07:42:27,660 --> 07:42:28,080
however, as

28503
07:42:28,080 --> 07:42:28,760
to press for it.

28504
07:42:28,760 --> 07:42:30,860
If in convenient adieu,

28505
07:42:31,940 --> 07:42:32,600
I take up my

28506
07:42:32,600 --> 07:42:33,240
pen again to

28507
07:42:33,240 --> 07:42:33,780
do what I have

28508
07:42:33,780 --> 07:42:34,380
just told you

28509
07:42:34,380 --> 07:42:35,180
I would not.

28510
07:42:35,180 --> 07:42:36,140
But circumstances

28511
07:42:36,140 --> 07:42:36,440
are such

28512
07:42:36,440 --> 07:42:37,020
that I cannot

28513
07:42:37,020 --> 07:42:37,760
help earnestly

28514
07:42:37,760 --> 07:42:38,280
begging you

28515
07:42:38,280 --> 07:42:38,880
all to come here

28516
07:42:38,880 --> 07:42:40,080
as soon as possible.

28517
07:42:40,200 --> 07:42:40,920
I know my dear

28518
07:42:40,920 --> 07:42:42,120
uncle and aunt so well

28519
07:42:42,120 --> 07:42:42,860
that I am not afraid

28520
07:42:42,860 --> 07:42:43,860
of requesting it,

28521
07:42:43,860 --> 07:42:44,000
though

28522
07:42:44,000 --> 07:42:44,820
I have still something

28523
07:42:44,820 --> 07:42:45,180
more to

28524
07:42:45,180 --> 07:42:46,380
ask of the former.

28525
07:42:46,580 --> 07:42:47,400
My father is going.

28526
07:42:47,400 --> 07:42:47,820
To London

28527
07:42:47,820 --> 07:42:48,240
with Colonel

28528
07:42:48,240 --> 07:42:49,100
Foster instantly

28529
07:42:49,100 --> 07:42:50,300
to try to discover

28530
07:42:50,400 --> 07:42:51,300
what he means to do.

28531
07:42:51,300 --> 07:42:52,500
I am sure I know not.

28532
07:42:52,680 --> 07:42:52,980
But his

28533
07:42:52,980 --> 07:42:53,880
excessive distress

28534
07:42:53,880 --> 07:42:54,380
will not allow.

28535
07:42:54,380 --> 07:42:54,920
Him to pursue

28536
07:42:54,920 --> 07:42:55,920
any measure in the

28537
07:42:55,920 --> 07:42:57,120
and safest way.

28538
07:42:57,180 --> 07:42:57,660
And kind of.

28539
07:42:57,660 --> 07:42:58,500
Foster is obliged

28540
07:42:58,500 --> 07:42:59,400
to be at Brighton again

28541
07:42:59,400 --> 07:43:00,600
tomorrow evening.

28542
07:43:00,620 --> 07:43:01,800
In such an exigency,

28543
07:43:01,800 --> 07:43:02,400
my uncle's

28544
07:43:02,400 --> 07:43:03,420
advice and assistance

28545
07:43:03,420 --> 07:43:03,660
would be

28546
07:43:03,660 --> 07:43:04,860
everything in the world.

28547
07:43:05,060 --> 07:43:05,360
He Will

28548
07:43:05,360 --> 07:43:06,360
immediately comprehend

28549
07:43:06,360 --> 07:43:07,500
what I must feel.

28550
07:43:07,500 --> 07:43:08,420
And I rely upon

28551
07:43:08,420 --> 07:43:09,620
his goodness.

28552
07:43:09,800 --> 07:43:11,120
Ho! Where?

28553
07:43:11,140 --> 07:43:12,420
Where is my uncle?

28554
07:43:12,720 --> 07:43:13,500
Cried Elizabeth,

28555
07:43:13,500 --> 07:43:14,460
darting from her seat

28556
07:43:14,460 --> 07:43:15,000
as she finished

28557
07:43:15,000 --> 07:43:16,280
the letter and eagerness

28558
07:43:16,280 --> 07:43:17,160
to follow him

28559
07:43:17,160 --> 07:43:17,780
without losing

28560
07:43:17,780 --> 07:43:18,660
a moment of time

28561
07:43:18,660 --> 07:43:19,700
so precious.

28562
07:43:19,700 --> 07:43:20,480
But as she reached,

28563
07:43:20,480 --> 07:43:21,320
the door was opened

28564
07:43:21,320 --> 07:43:22,260
by a servant.

28565
07:43:22,260 --> 07:43:22,760
As Mr.

28566
07:43:22,760 --> 07:43:23,960
Darcy appeared,

28567
07:43:24,080 --> 07:43:25,140
her pale face,

28568
07:43:25,140 --> 07:43:26,000
impetuous manner

28569
07:43:26,000 --> 07:43:27,000
made him start,

28570
07:43:27,000 --> 07:43:27,500
and before

28571
07:43:27,500 --> 07:43:28,460
he could recover himself

28572
07:43:28,460 --> 07:43:29,240
to speak,

28573
07:43:29,240 --> 07:43:30,440
she in whose mind

28574
07:43:30,440 --> 07:43:31,140
every idea

28575
07:43:31,140 --> 07:43:31,800
was superseded

28576
07:43:31,800 --> 07:43:33,000
by Lydia's situation.

28577
07:43:33,200 --> 07:43:34,400
Hastily exclaimed,

28578
07:43:34,760 --> 07:43:35,640
I beg your pardon,

28579
07:43:35,640 --> 07:43:36,620
but I must leave you.

28580
07:43:36,620 --> 07:43:37,800
I must find Mr.

28581
07:43:37,800 --> 07:43:38,180
Gardiner,

28582
07:43:38,180 --> 07:43:39,620
this moment on business

28583
07:43:39,620 --> 07:43:40,820
that cannot be delayed.

28584
07:43:40,880 --> 07:43:41,300
I have not

28585
07:43:41,300 --> 07:43:42,500
an instant to lose.

28586
07:43:43,140 --> 07:43:43,820
Good God.

28587
07:43:43,820 --> 07:43:45,020
What is the matter?

28588
07:43:45,200 --> 07:43:45,720
Cried He,

28589
07:43:45,720 --> 07:43:46,440
with more feeling

28590
07:43:46,440 --> 07:43:47,780
than politeness, then

28591
07:43:47,780 --> 07:43:48,980
recollecting himself.

28592
07:43:49,580 --> 07:43:50,480
I will not detain

28593
07:43:50,480 --> 07:43:51,720
you a minute, but let me

28594
07:43:51,720 --> 07:43:51,980
or let

28595
07:43:51,980 --> 07:43:52,800
the servant go off

28596
07:43:52,800 --> 07:43:53,220
to Mr.

28597
07:43:53,220 --> 07:43:54,320
and Mrs. Gardiner.

28598
07:43:54,320 --> 07:43:55,160
You are not well enough.

28599
07:43:55,160 --> 07:43:56,240
You cannot go yourself.

28600
07:43:57,240 --> 07:43:58,440
Elizabeth hesitated,

28601
07:43:58,580 --> 07:43:58,920
but her

28602
07:43:58,920 --> 07:44:00,120
knees trembled under her

28603
07:44:00,260 --> 07:44:00,860
and she felt

28604
07:44:00,860 --> 07:44:01,260
how little

28605
07:44:01,260 --> 07:44:02,040
would be gained by her

28606
07:44:02,040 --> 07:44:02,420
attempting

28607
07:44:02,420 --> 07:44:03,540
to pursue them,

28608
07:44:03,540 --> 07:44:04,160
calling back.

28609
07:44:04,160 --> 07:44:04,680
The servant,

28610
07:44:04,680 --> 07:44:05,280
therefore she

28611
07:44:05,280 --> 07:44:06,180
commissioned him,

28612
07:44:06,180 --> 07:44:07,140
though in so breathless

28613
07:44:07,140 --> 07:44:08,060
an accent has made her

28614
07:44:08,060 --> 07:44:09,260
almost unintelligible.

28615
07:44:09,360 --> 07:44:10,400
To fetch his master

28616
07:44:10,400 --> 07:44:10,980
and mistress,

28617
07:44:10,980 --> 07:44:12,180
whom instantly.

28618
07:44:12,320 --> 07:44:12,780
On his.

28619
07:44:12,780 --> 07:44:13,520
Quitting the room,

28620
07:44:13,520 --> 07:44:14,720
she down unable

28621
07:44:14,720 --> 07:44:15,800
to support herself,

28622
07:44:15,800 --> 07:44:16,340
and looking

28623
07:44:16,340 --> 07:44:17,240
so miserably ill

28624
07:44:17,240 --> 07:44:18,120
that it was impossible

28625
07:44:18,120 --> 07:44:19,320
for Dorothy to leave her

28626
07:44:19,340 --> 07:44:20,060
or to refrain

28627
07:44:20,060 --> 07:44:20,660
from saying

28628
07:44:20,660 --> 07:44:21,620
in a tone of gentleness

28629
07:44:21,620 --> 07:44:22,820
and commiseration.

28630
07:44:22,920 --> 07:44:24,120
Let me call your.

28631
07:44:24,240 --> 07:44:24,900
Is there nothing

28632
07:44:24,900 --> 07:44:25,380
you could take

28633
07:44:25,380 --> 07:44:25,700
to give you

28634
07:44:25,700 --> 07:44:26,900
present relief?

28635
07:44:27,060 --> 07:44:28,100
A glass of wine.

28636
07:44:28,100 --> 07:44:29,280
Shall I get you one?

28637
07:44:29,280 --> 07:44:30,480
You are very ill.

28638
07:44:30,840 --> 07:44:32,160
No, I thank you.

28639
07:44:32,460 --> 07:44:33,620
She replied, endeavoring

28640
07:44:33,620 --> 07:44:34,820
to recover herself.

28641
07:44:34,980 --> 07:44:35,520
There is nothing

28642
07:44:35,520 --> 07:44:36,540
the matter with me.

28643
07:44:36,540 --> 07:44:37,740
I am quite well.

28644
07:44:37,860 --> 07:44:39,140
I am only distressed

28645
07:44:39,140 --> 07:44:40,140
by some dreadful news

28646
07:44:40,140 --> 07:44:40,460
which I have

28647
07:44:40,460 --> 07:44:41,040
just received

28648
07:44:41,040 --> 07:44:42,240
from long ball.

28649
07:44:42,420 --> 07:44:43,460
She burst into tears,

28650
07:44:43,460 --> 07:44:44,640
as she alluded to it

28651
07:44:44,640 --> 07:44:45,620
and for a few minutes

28652
07:44:45,620 --> 07:44:46,220
could not speak

28653
07:44:46,220 --> 07:44:47,340
another word.

28654
07:44:47,340 --> 07:44:48,080
Darcy, in

28655
07:44:48,080 --> 07:44:49,080
wretched suspense,

28656
07:44:49,080 --> 07:44:50,060
could only say something

28657
07:44:50,060 --> 07:44:50,700
indistinctly

28658
07:44:50,700 --> 07:44:51,720
of his concern

28659
07:44:51,720 --> 07:44:52,440
and observe her

28660
07:44:52,440 --> 07:44:53,160
in compassionate

28661
07:44:53,160 --> 07:44:54,360
silence.

28662
07:44:54,380 --> 07:44:54,920
At length

28663
07:44:54,920 --> 07:44:56,120
she spoke again.

28664
07:44:56,700 --> 07:44:57,720
I have just had a letter

28665
07:44:57,720 --> 07:44:58,260
from Jane

28666
07:44:58,260 --> 07:44:59,880
with such dreadful news.

28667
07:45:00,260 --> 07:45:01,260
It cannot be concealed

28668
07:45:01,260 --> 07:45:02,420
from anyone.

28669
07:45:02,420 --> 07:45:03,320
My younger sister

28670
07:45:03,320 --> 07:45:04,560
has all her friends,

28671
07:45:04,920 --> 07:45:05,940
has eloped,

28672
07:45:05,940 --> 07:45:06,800
has thrown herself

28673
07:45:06,800 --> 07:45:08,000
into the power of

28674
07:45:08,460 --> 07:45:09,000
of Mr.

28675
07:45:09,000 --> 07:45:10,200
Wickham

28676
07:45:10,220 --> 07:45:11,160
had gone off together

28677
07:45:11,160 --> 07:45:12,360
from Brighton.

28678
07:45:12,420 --> 07:45:13,380
You know him too

28679
07:45:13,380 --> 07:45:14,580
well to doubt the rest.

28680
07:45:14,900 --> 07:45:15,800
She has no money,

28681
07:45:15,800 --> 07:45:16,620
no connections,

28682
07:45:16,620 --> 07:45:17,160
nothing that

28683
07:45:17,160 --> 07:45:18,200
contempt him.

28684
07:45:18,200 --> 07:45:19,640
She is lost forever.

28685
07:45:20,480 --> 07:45:21,600
Darcy was fixed

28686
07:45:21,600 --> 07:45:23,400
in astonishment when.

28687
07:45:23,400 --> 07:45:24,600
I consider.

28688
07:45:24,720 --> 07:45:25,680
She added, in a yet

28689
07:45:25,680 --> 07:45:26,880
more agitated voice.

28690
07:45:27,140 --> 07:45:28,040
That I might have

28691
07:45:28,040 --> 07:45:29,120
prevented it.

28692
07:45:29,120 --> 07:45:30,600
I who knew what he was

28693
07:45:31,100 --> 07:45:32,280
had I explained

28694
07:45:32,280 --> 07:45:33,480
some part of it.

28695
07:45:33,620 --> 07:45:34,500
Some part of what

28696
07:45:34,500 --> 07:45:35,040
I learned to

28697
07:45:35,040 --> 07:45:36,240
my own family.

28698
07:45:36,440 --> 07:45:37,200
Had his character

28699
07:45:37,200 --> 07:45:37,620
being known,

28700
07:45:37,620 --> 07:45:37,920
this could

28701
07:45:37,920 --> 07:45:39,120
not have happened.

28702
07:45:39,300 --> 07:45:40,500
But it is all

28703
07:45:40,640 --> 07:45:42,020
all too late now.

28704
07:45:42,860 --> 07:45:44,060
I am grieved, indeed.

28705
07:45:44,580 --> 07:45:45,780
Cried Darcy.

28706
07:45:45,860 --> 07:45:46,980
Grieved, shocked.

28707
07:45:46,980 --> 07:45:47,960
But is it certain?

28708
07:45:47,960 --> 07:45:48,980
Absolutely certain.

28709
07:45:50,300 --> 07:45:51,200
Oh, yes.

28710
07:45:51,200 --> 07:45:52,080
They left Brighton

28711
07:45:52,080 --> 07:45:53,160
together on Sunday night

28712
07:45:53,160 --> 07:45:53,700
and were traced

28713
07:45:53,700 --> 07:45:54,540
almost to London,

28714
07:45:54,540 --> 07:45:55,620
but not beyond.

28715
07:45:55,620 --> 07:45:56,540
They are certainly not

28716
07:45:56,540 --> 07:45:57,740
gone to Scotland.

28717
07:45:58,040 --> 07:45:59,240
And what has been done?

28718
07:45:59,300 --> 07:46:00,260
What has been attempted

28719
07:46:00,260 --> 07:46:01,460
to recover her?

28720
07:46:01,740 --> 07:46:02,360
My father has

28721
07:46:02,360 --> 07:46:03,320
gone to London

28722
07:46:03,320 --> 07:46:04,040
and Jane has written

28723
07:46:04,040 --> 07:46:04,800
to beg my uncle's

28724
07:46:04,800 --> 07:46:06,000
immediate assistance.

28725
07:46:06,020 --> 07:46:06,900
Had we shall be off,

28726
07:46:06,900 --> 07:46:08,100
I hope, in half an hour.

28727
07:46:08,660 --> 07:46:09,920
But nothing can be done.

28728
07:46:10,160 --> 07:46:10,980
I know very well

28729
07:46:10,980 --> 07:46:11,360
that nothing

28730
07:46:11,360 --> 07:46:12,380
can be done.

28731
07:46:12,380 --> 07:46:13,260
How is such a man

28732
07:46:13,260 --> 07:46:14,340
to be worked on?

28733
07:46:14,340 --> 07:46:14,780
How are they

28734
07:46:14,780 --> 07:46:15,980
even to be discovered?

28735
07:46:16,320 --> 07:46:16,640
I have not

28736
07:46:16,640 --> 07:46:17,840
the smallest hope.

28737
07:46:17,840 --> 07:46:19,040
It is every way

28738
07:46:19,060 --> 07:46:20,260
horrible.

28739
07:46:20,600 --> 07:46:21,080
Darcy

28740
07:46:21,080 --> 07:46:22,400
shook his head, silent.

28741
07:46:22,400 --> 07:46:23,600
Acquiescence.

28742
07:46:24,000 --> 07:46:25,020
When my eyes

28743
07:46:25,020 --> 07:46:25,460
were opened,

28744
07:46:25,460 --> 07:46:26,660
his real character,

28745
07:46:27,120 --> 07:46:28,160
who had I known

28746
07:46:28,160 --> 07:46:28,880
what I thought,

28747
07:46:28,880 --> 07:46:30,240
what I dared to do.

28748
07:46:30,600 --> 07:46:31,800
But I knew not.

28749
07:46:31,820 --> 07:46:32,840
I was afraid of doing

28750
07:46:32,840 --> 07:46:34,400
too much wretched,

28751
07:46:34,640 --> 07:46:36,020
wretched mistake.

28752
07:46:36,840 --> 07:46:37,320
Darcy

28753
07:46:37,320 --> 07:46:38,520
made no answer.

28754
07:46:38,520 --> 07:46:39,600
He seemed scarcely

28755
07:46:39,600 --> 07:46:40,380
to hear her

28756
07:46:40,380 --> 07:46:41,240
and was walking up

28757
07:46:41,240 --> 07:46:41,700
and down

28758
07:46:41,700 --> 07:46:42,060
room in

28759
07:46:42,060 --> 07:46:43,260
earnest meditation.

28760
07:46:43,400 --> 07:46:44,660
His brow contracted

28761
07:46:44,820 --> 07:46:45,380
his air.

28762
07:46:45,380 --> 07:46:46,820
Gloomy, Elizabeth

28763
07:46:46,820 --> 07:46:47,640
soon observed,

28764
07:46:47,640 --> 07:46:48,240
and instantly

28765
07:46:48,240 --> 07:46:49,320
understood it.

28766
07:46:49,320 --> 07:46:50,520
Her power was sinking.

28767
07:46:50,780 --> 07:46:52,400
Everything must under

28768
07:46:52,400 --> 07:46:53,000
such a proof

28769
07:46:53,000 --> 07:46:54,200
of family weakness.

28770
07:46:54,320 --> 07:46:55,340
Such an assurance

28771
07:46:55,340 --> 07:46:56,760
of the deepest disgrace.

28772
07:46:57,260 --> 07:46:57,920
She could neither

28773
07:46:57,920 --> 07:46:59,120
wonder nor condemn.

28774
07:46:59,400 --> 07:47:00,060
But the belief

28775
07:47:00,060 --> 07:47:01,140
of his self conquest

28776
07:47:01,140 --> 07:47:02,340
brought nothing

28777
07:47:02,400 --> 07:47:03,300
to her bosom,

28778
07:47:03,300 --> 07:47:04,580
afforded no palliation

28779
07:47:04,580 --> 07:47:05,780
of her distress.

28780
07:47:05,820 --> 07:47:07,140
It was, on the contrary,

28781
07:47:07,140 --> 07:47:08,280
exactly calculated

28782
07:47:08,280 --> 07:47:09,200
to make her understand

28783
07:47:09,200 --> 07:47:10,280
her own wishes

28784
07:47:10,280 --> 07:47:11,160
had never had she

28785
07:47:11,160 --> 07:47:12,080
so honestly

28786
07:47:12,080 --> 07:47:12,440
that she could

28787
07:47:12,440 --> 07:47:13,760
have loved him as now,

28788
07:47:13,940 --> 07:47:14,880
when all love

28789
07:47:14,880 --> 07:47:16,080
must be in vain.

28790
07:47:16,700 --> 07:47:17,540
But self,

28791
07:47:17,540 --> 07:47:18,740
though it would intrude,

28792
07:47:18,780 --> 07:47:20,000
could not engross her

28793
07:47:20,480 --> 07:47:21,680
Lydia, the

28794
07:47:22,340 --> 07:47:22,920
the misery

28795
07:47:22,920 --> 07:47:23,480
she was bringing

28796
07:47:23,480 --> 07:47:24,200
on them all.

28797
07:47:24,200 --> 07:47:25,200
Soon swallowed up

28798
07:47:25,200 --> 07:47:26,400
every private care

28799
07:47:26,600 --> 07:47:27,660
and covering her face

28800
07:47:27,660 --> 07:47:28,740
with her handkerchief.

28801
07:47:28,740 --> 07:47:29,640
Elizabeth was soon

28802
07:47:29,640 --> 07:47:30,900
lost to everything else,

28803
07:47:31,260 --> 07:47:32,240
and after a pause

28804
07:47:32,240 --> 07:47:33,200
of several minutes,

28805
07:47:33,200 --> 07:47:34,320
was only recalled to

28806
07:47:34,320 --> 07:47:35,580
a sense of her situation

28807
07:47:35,760 --> 07:47:36,320
by the voice

28808
07:47:36,320 --> 07:47:37,520
of her companion,

28809
07:47:37,560 --> 07:47:38,480
who in a manner

28810
07:47:38,480 --> 07:47:39,360
which though it spake

28811
07:47:39,360 --> 07:47:40,580
compassion, spoke,

28812
07:47:41,100 --> 07:47:42,060
restraint said.

28813
07:47:43,640 --> 07:47:44,420
I am afraid

28814
07:47:44,420 --> 07:47:44,820
you have been

28815
07:47:44,820 --> 07:47:45,500
long desiring

28816
07:47:45,500 --> 07:47:46,700
my absence.

28817
07:47:47,400 --> 07:47:47,960
Nor have I

28818
07:47:47,960 --> 07:47:48,500
anything to

28819
07:47:48,500 --> 07:47:49,400
plead an excuse

28820
07:47:49,400 --> 07:47:50,600
of my stay.

28821
07:47:50,940 --> 07:47:51,620
But real though

28822
07:47:51,620 --> 07:47:52,820
unavailing concern

28823
07:47:53,940 --> 07:47:55,020
with to heaven

28824
07:47:55,020 --> 07:47:55,680
that anything

28825
07:47:55,680 --> 07:47:55,940
could be

28826
07:47:55,940 --> 07:47:56,420
either said

28827
07:47:56,420 --> 07:47:57,620
or done on my part

28828
07:47:57,720 --> 07:47:58,200
that might

28829
07:47:58,200 --> 07:47:59,160
offer consolation

28830
07:47:59,160 --> 07:48:00,360
to such distress.

28831
07:48:00,560 --> 07:48:01,640
But I will not torment

28832
07:48:01,640 --> 07:48:02,840
you with vain wishes,

28833
07:48:03,060 --> 07:48:04,320
which may seem purposely

28834
07:48:04,320 --> 07:48:05,520
to ask for your things.

28835
07:48:05,880 --> 07:48:06,780
This unfortunate

28836
07:48:06,780 --> 07:48:07,380
affair will,

28837
07:48:07,380 --> 07:48:08,280
I fear, prevent

28838
07:48:08,280 --> 07:48:08,820
my sisters

28839
07:48:08,820 --> 07:48:09,600
having the pleasure

28840
07:48:09,600 --> 07:48:10,140
of seeing

28841
07:48:10,140 --> 07:48:11,340
at Pemberley today?

28842
07:48:12,140 --> 07:48:13,160
Oh, yes.

28843
07:48:13,160 --> 07:48:13,860
Be so kind

28844
07:48:13,860 --> 07:48:14,600
as to apologize

28845
07:48:14,600 --> 07:48:15,800
for us to Miss Darcy.

28846
07:48:16,020 --> 07:48:16,820
Say that

28847
07:48:16,820 --> 07:48:18,120
urgent business calls

28848
07:48:18,120 --> 07:48:19,320
as I immediately

28849
07:48:19,320 --> 07:48:20,700
conceal unhappy truth.

28850
07:48:20,700 --> 07:48:21,180
As long as

28851
07:48:21,180 --> 07:48:22,220
it is possible.

28852
07:48:22,220 --> 07:48:22,700
I know

28853
07:48:22,700 --> 07:48:23,900
it cannot be long.

28854
07:48:24,900 --> 07:48:25,980
He readily assures her

28855
07:48:25,980 --> 07:48:27,420
of his secrecy, again

28856
07:48:27,420 --> 07:48:28,520
expressed his sorrow

28857
07:48:28,520 --> 07:48:29,540
for her distress.

28858
07:48:29,540 --> 07:48:30,200
Wished it a.

28859
07:48:30,200 --> 07:48:31,160
Happier conclusion

28860
07:48:31,160 --> 07:48:31,440
that there

28861
07:48:31,440 --> 07:48:32,060
was at present

28862
07:48:32,060 --> 07:48:33,060
reason to hope.

28863
07:48:33,060 --> 07:48:33,660
And leaving

28864
07:48:33,660 --> 07:48:34,340
his compliments

28865
07:48:34,340 --> 07:48:35,340
for her relations

28866
07:48:35,340 --> 07:48:36,780
with only one serious

28867
07:48:36,780 --> 07:48:38,480
parting look went away.

28868
07:48:39,540 --> 07:48:40,740
As he quitted the room.

28869
07:48:40,940 --> 07:48:41,820
Elizabeth felt

28870
07:48:41,820 --> 07:48:42,600
how improbable

28871
07:48:42,600 --> 07:48:43,040
it was that

28872
07:48:43,040 --> 07:48:43,340
they should

28873
07:48:43,340 --> 07:48:43,980
ever see each

28874
07:48:43,980 --> 07:48:44,540
other again

28875
07:48:44,540 --> 07:48:45,380
on such terms

28876
07:48:45,380 --> 07:48:46,440
of cordiality,

28877
07:48:46,440 --> 07:48:47,100
as had marked

28878
07:48:47,100 --> 07:48:47,960
their several meetings

28879
07:48:47,960 --> 07:48:49,100
in Derbyshire.

28880
07:48:49,100 --> 07:48:49,800
And as she threw

28881
07:48:49,800 --> 07:48:50,940
a retrospective glance

28882
07:48:50,940 --> 07:48:51,200
over the

28883
07:48:51,200 --> 07:48:51,480
whole of

28884
07:48:51,480 --> 07:48:52,520
their acquaintance.

28885
07:48:52,520 --> 07:48:52,820
So.

28886
07:48:52,820 --> 07:48:54,000
Full of contradictions

28887
07:48:54,000 --> 07:48:55,640
and varieties, sighed

28888
07:48:55,640 --> 07:48:56,300
at the perverse

28889
07:48:56,300 --> 07:48:57,240
ness of those feelings

28890
07:48:57,240 --> 07:48:57,780
which would have now

28891
07:48:57,780 --> 07:48:58,980
promoted its

28892
07:48:59,300 --> 07:49:00,120
and would formally

28893
07:49:00,120 --> 07:49:00,740
have rejoiced

28894
07:49:00,740 --> 07:49:01,940
in its termination.

28895
07:49:02,720 --> 07:49:04,200
If gratitude and esteem

28896
07:49:04,200 --> 07:49:04,460
are good

28897
07:49:04,460 --> 07:49:05,000
foundations

28898
07:49:05,000 --> 07:49:05,900
of affection.

28899
07:49:05,900 --> 07:49:07,020
Elizabeth's change

28900
07:49:07,020 --> 07:49:07,640
of sentiment

28901
07:49:07,640 --> 07:49:09,000
will be improbable

28902
07:49:09,000 --> 07:49:10,200
nor faulty.

28903
07:49:10,280 --> 07:49:11,480
But if otherwise,

28904
07:49:11,600 --> 07:49:12,300
if regard

28905
07:49:12,300 --> 07:49:12,960
springing from

28906
07:49:12,960 --> 07:49:13,740
such sources

28907
07:49:13,740 --> 07:49:14,640
is unreasonable

28908
07:49:14,640 --> 07:49:15,680
or unnatural

28909
07:49:15,680 --> 07:49:16,580
in comparison of

28910
07:49:16,580 --> 07:49:17,340
what is so often

28911
07:49:17,340 --> 07:49:17,960
described

28912
07:49:17,960 --> 07:49:18,600
arising on a

28913
07:49:18,600 --> 07:49:19,340
first interview

28914
07:49:19,340 --> 07:49:20,460
with its object

28915
07:49:20,460 --> 07:49:21,240
and even before

28916
07:49:21,240 --> 07:49:21,800
two words

28917
07:49:21,800 --> 07:49:23,000
have been exchanged,

28918
07:49:23,060 --> 07:49:23,780
nothing can be

28919
07:49:23,780 --> 07:49:24,980
said in her defense,

28920
07:49:25,140 --> 07:49:25,760
except that

28921
07:49:25,760 --> 07:49:26,240
she had given

28922
07:49:26,240 --> 07:49:27,140
somewhat of a trial

28923
07:49:27,140 --> 07:49:28,040
to the latter

28924
07:49:28,040 --> 07:49:28,920
in her partiality

28925
07:49:28,920 --> 07:49:29,720
for Wickham,

28926
07:49:29,720 --> 07:49:30,540
and that its ill

28927
07:49:30,540 --> 07:49:31,940
success might perhaps

28928
07:49:32,220 --> 07:49:32,940
authorize her

28929
07:49:32,940 --> 07:49:33,780
to seek the other,

28930
07:49:33,780 --> 07:49:34,580
less interesting

28931
07:49:34,580 --> 07:49:35,780
mode of attachment.

28932
07:49:36,120 --> 07:49:37,320
Be that as it may,

28933
07:49:37,500 --> 07:49:38,120
she saw him

28934
07:49:38,120 --> 07:49:39,320
go with regret.

28935
07:49:39,360 --> 07:49:39,920
And in this

28936
07:49:39,920 --> 07:49:40,740
early example

28937
07:49:40,740 --> 07:49:41,940
of what Lydia's infamy

28938
07:49:41,940 --> 07:49:42,980
must produce

28939
07:49:42,980 --> 07:49:44,300
found additional anguish

28940
07:49:44,300 --> 07:49:45,020
as she reflected

28941
07:49:45,020 --> 07:49:45,380
on that

28942
07:49:45,380 --> 07:49:46,580
wretched business.

28943
07:49:46,760 --> 07:49:47,820
Never since reading

28944
07:49:47,820 --> 07:49:49,020
Jane's second letter

28945
07:49:49,080 --> 07:49:49,980
had she entertained

28946
07:49:49,980 --> 07:49:50,880
a hope of Wickham's

28947
07:49:50,880 --> 07:49:52,080
meaning to marry her.

28948
07:49:52,200 --> 07:49:53,300
No one but Jane,

28949
07:49:53,300 --> 07:49:54,000
she thought,

28950
07:49:54,000 --> 07:49:54,560
could flatter

28951
07:49:54,560 --> 07:49:55,400
herself with such an.

28952
07:49:55,400 --> 07:49:56,300
Expectation.

28953
07:49:57,320 --> 07:49:58,020
Was the least of her

28954
07:49:58,020 --> 07:49:58,460
feelings

28955
07:49:58,460 --> 07:49:59,660
on this development.

28956
07:49:59,720 --> 07:50:00,540
While the contents

28957
07:50:00,540 --> 07:50:01,220
of the first letter

28958
07:50:01,220 --> 07:50:02,300
remained in her mind,

28959
07:50:02,300 --> 07:50:03,500
she was all surprise,

28960
07:50:03,680 --> 07:50:04,580
all astonishment

28961
07:50:04,580 --> 07:50:05,100
that Wickham

28962
07:50:05,100 --> 07:50:05,960
should marry a girl

28963
07:50:05,960 --> 07:50:06,920
whom it was impossible

28964
07:50:06,920 --> 07:50:08,120
could marry for money.

28965
07:50:08,180 --> 07:50:09,080
And how Lydia could

28966
07:50:09,080 --> 07:50:09,880
ever have attached

28967
07:50:09,880 --> 07:50:10,520
him had appeared

28968
07:50:10,520 --> 07:50:11,720
incomprehensible.

28969
07:50:11,940 --> 07:50:12,960
But now it was

28970
07:50:12,960 --> 07:50:14,160
all too natural

28971
07:50:14,480 --> 07:50:15,620
for such an attachment

28972
07:50:15,620 --> 07:50:16,380
as this.

28973
07:50:16,380 --> 07:50:16,920
She have

28974
07:50:16,920 --> 07:50:18,120
sufficient charms.

28975
07:50:18,200 --> 07:50:18,980
And though she did not.

28976
07:50:18,980 --> 07:50:19,640
Suppose Lydia

28977
07:50:19,640 --> 07:50:19,860
to be

28978
07:50:19,860 --> 07:50:20,880
deliberately engaging

28979
07:50:20,880 --> 07:50:21,540
in an elopement

28980
07:50:21,540 --> 07:50:21,920
without the

28981
07:50:21,920 --> 07:50:23,120
intention of marriage,

28982
07:50:23,220 --> 07:50:24,320
she had no difficulty

28983
07:50:24,320 --> 07:50:24,800
in believing

28984
07:50:24,800 --> 07:50:26,000
that neither her virtue

28985
07:50:26,060 --> 07:50:27,260
nor understanding

28986
07:50:27,320 --> 07:50:28,020
would preserve her

28987
07:50:28,020 --> 07:50:28,700
from falling

28988
07:50:28,700 --> 07:50:29,820
an easy prey

28989
07:50:29,820 --> 07:50:31,100
she had never perceived,

28990
07:50:31,100 --> 07:50:31,760
while the regiment

28991
07:50:31,760 --> 07:50:32,960
was in Hertfordshire

28992
07:50:32,960 --> 07:50:33,860
that Lydia had any

28993
07:50:33,860 --> 07:50:35,060
partiality for him.

28994
07:50:35,400 --> 07:50:36,380
But she was convinced

28995
07:50:36,380 --> 07:50:37,320
that Lydia wanted

28996
07:50:37,320 --> 07:50:38,300
only encouragement

28997
07:50:38,300 --> 07:50:39,180
to attach herself

28998
07:50:39,180 --> 07:50:40,280
to anybody.

28999
07:50:40,280 --> 07:50:41,640
Sometimes one officer,

29000
07:50:41,640 --> 07:50:42,180
sometimes

29001
07:50:42,180 --> 07:50:42,860
another had been

29002
07:50:42,860 --> 07:50:43,640
her favorite

29003
07:50:43,640 --> 07:50:44,580
as their attentions

29004
07:50:44,580 --> 07:50:45,240
raised them in

29005
07:50:45,240 --> 07:50:46,260
her opinion.

29006
07:50:46,260 --> 07:50:47,120
her affections had

29007
07:50:47,120 --> 07:50:47,700
continually

29008
07:50:47,700 --> 07:50:48,620
been fluctuating,

29009
07:50:48,620 --> 07:50:49,100
but never

29010
07:50:49,100 --> 07:50:50,300
without an object.

29011
07:50:50,340 --> 07:50:51,180
The mischief of.

29012
07:50:51,180 --> 07:50:52,440
Neglect and mistaken

29013
07:50:52,440 --> 07:50:53,360
indulgence towards

29014
07:50:53,360 --> 07:50:54,540
such a girl.

29015
07:50:54,540 --> 07:50:55,620
Oh, how acutely

29016
07:50:55,620 --> 07:50:56,820
did she now feel it?

29017
07:50:57,180 --> 07:50:58,320
She was wild to be.

29018
07:50:58,320 --> 07:50:59,580
At home, to hear,

29019
07:50:59,580 --> 07:51:00,920
to see, to be upon.

29020
07:51:00,920 --> 07:51:01,460
The spot,

29021
07:51:01,460 --> 07:51:02,420
to share with Jane

29022
07:51:02,420 --> 07:51:03,000
in the cares

29023
07:51:03,000 --> 07:51:03,660
that must now

29024
07:51:03,660 --> 07:51:04,920
fall wholly upon her

29025
07:51:05,160 --> 07:51:06,720
in a family so deranged.

29026
07:51:06,900 --> 07:51:08,100
A father absent,

29027
07:51:08,120 --> 07:51:09,200
a mother incapable

29028
07:51:09,200 --> 07:51:09,920
of exertion

29029
07:51:09,920 --> 07:51:10,680
and requiring

29030
07:51:10,680 --> 07:51:11,880
constant attendance.

29031
07:51:12,080 --> 07:51:12,600
And though

29032
07:51:12,600 --> 07:51:13,580
almost persuaded.

29033
07:51:13,580 --> 07:51:14,040
That nothing

29034
07:51:14,040 --> 07:51:15,240
could be done for Lydia,

29035
07:51:15,320 --> 07:51:16,580
her uncles interference

29036
07:51:16,580 --> 07:51:17,060
seemed of the

29037
07:51:17,060 --> 07:51:18,260
utmost importance.

29038
07:51:18,480 --> 07:51:19,280
Until he entered

29039
07:51:19,280 --> 07:51:19,740
the room,

29040
07:51:19,740 --> 07:51:20,400
her patients

29041
07:51:20,400 --> 07:51:21,500
were severe.

29042
07:51:21,500 --> 07:51:22,380
Mr. and Mrs.

29043
07:51:22,380 --> 07:51:22,860
Gardner

29044
07:51:22,860 --> 07:51:23,240
had hurried

29045
07:51:23,240 --> 07:51:24,300
back in alarm.

29046
07:51:24,300 --> 07:51:24,980
Supposing by

29047
07:51:24,980 --> 07:51:25,460
the servants

29048
07:51:25,460 --> 07:51:25,980
account,

29049
07:51:25,980 --> 07:51:26,840
their niece was taken

29050
07:51:26,840 --> 07:51:27,980
suddenly ill.

29051
07:51:27,980 --> 07:51:29,000
But satisfying them

29052
07:51:29,000 --> 07:51:30,200
instantly on that head,

29053
07:51:30,380 --> 07:51:31,560
she eagerly communicated

29054
07:51:31,560 --> 07:51:32,040
the cause of

29055
07:51:32,040 --> 07:51:33,260
their summons, reading

29056
07:51:33,260 --> 07:51:34,460
the two letters aloud

29057
07:51:34,500 --> 07:51:35,100
and dwelling

29058
07:51:35,100 --> 07:51:35,820
on the postscript

29059
07:51:35,820 --> 07:51:36,360
of the last

29060
07:51:36,360 --> 07:51:37,560
with trembling energy.

29061
07:51:37,680 --> 07:51:37,880
Though

29062
07:51:37,880 --> 07:51:38,720
Lydia had never been

29063
07:51:38,720 --> 07:51:39,780
a favorite with them.

29064
07:51:39,780 --> 07:51:40,500
Mr. and Mrs.

29065
07:51:40,500 --> 07:51:41,340
Gardner could not be

29066
07:51:41,340 --> 07:51:42,540
but deeply afflicted.

29067
07:51:42,920 --> 07:51:44,120
Not Lydia only,

29068
07:51:44,120 --> 07:51:44,720
but all were

29069
07:51:44,720 --> 07:51:45,680
concerned in it.

29070
07:51:45,680 --> 07:51:46,220
And after the

29071
07:51:46,220 --> 07:51:47,240
first exclamations

29072
07:51:47,240 --> 07:51:47,880
of surprise

29073
07:51:47,880 --> 07:51:48,980
and horror, Mr.

29074
07:51:48,980 --> 07:51:49,400
Gardner

29075
07:51:49,400 --> 07:51:49,800
promised

29076
07:51:49,800 --> 07:51:50,640
every assistance

29077
07:51:50,640 --> 07:51:51,840
in his power.

29078
07:51:51,840 --> 07:51:52,620
Elizabeth, though

29079
07:51:52,620 --> 07:51:53,820
expecting no less,

29080
07:51:53,840 --> 07:51:54,380
thanked him

29081
07:51:54,380 --> 07:51:55,580
with tears of gratitude.

29082
07:51:55,860 --> 07:51:56,640
And all three

29083
07:51:56,640 --> 07:51:57,380
being actuated

29084
07:51:57,380 --> 07:51:58,580
by one spirit.

29085
07:51:58,580 --> 07:51:59,480
Everything relating

29086
07:51:59,480 --> 07:52:00,080
to their journey

29087
07:52:00,080 --> 07:52:01,280
was speedily settled.

29088
07:52:01,500 --> 07:52:02,360
They were to be off

29089
07:52:02,360 --> 07:52:03,560
as soon as possible.

29090
07:52:04,020 --> 07:52:04,520
But what is

29091
07:52:04,520 --> 07:52:05,720
to be done about?

29092
07:52:06,080 --> 07:52:06,680
Cried Mrs.

29093
07:52:06,680 --> 07:52:07,520
Gardner.

29094
07:52:07,520 --> 07:52:08,540
John told us Mr.

29095
07:52:08,540 --> 07:52:09,300
Darcy was here

29096
07:52:09,300 --> 07:52:10,280
when you sent for us.

29097
07:52:10,280 --> 07:52:11,480
Was it so?

29098
07:52:11,720 --> 07:52:12,480
Yes.

29099
07:52:12,480 --> 07:52:13,160
And I told him

29100
07:52:13,160 --> 07:52:13,620
we should not

29101
07:52:13,620 --> 07:52:13,800
be able

29102
07:52:13,800 --> 07:52:15,000
to keep our engagement.

29103
07:52:15,120 --> 07:52:16,380
That is all settled.

29104
07:52:16,900 --> 07:52:18,100
What is all settled?

29105
07:52:18,240 --> 07:52:19,140
Repeated the other

29106
07:52:19,140 --> 07:52:19,440
as she

29107
07:52:19,440 --> 07:52:19,980
ran into her

29108
07:52:19,980 --> 07:52:21,180
room to prepare.

29109
07:52:21,180 --> 07:52:22,140
And are they upon

29110
07:52:22,140 --> 07:52:22,880
such terms

29111
07:52:22,880 --> 07:52:23,900
as for how to disclose

29112
07:52:23,900 --> 07:52:25,080
the real truth?

29113
07:52:25,080 --> 07:52:25,460
Oh, that.

29114
07:52:25,460 --> 07:52:26,660
I knew how it was,

29115
07:52:27,420 --> 07:52:28,080
but wishes.

29116
07:52:28,080 --> 07:52:29,540
Were vain, or at least

29117
07:52:29,540 --> 07:52:30,240
could only serve

29118
07:52:30,240 --> 07:52:30,840
to amuse her

29119
07:52:30,840 --> 07:52:31,320
in the hurry

29120
07:52:31,320 --> 07:52:31,980
and confusion

29121
07:52:31,980 --> 07:52:33,180
of the following hour.

29122
07:52:33,380 --> 07:52:34,080
Had Elizabeth

29123
07:52:34,080 --> 07:52:34,640
been at leisure

29124
07:52:34,640 --> 07:52:35,580
to be idle.

29125
07:52:35,580 --> 07:52:36,000
She would have

29126
07:52:36,000 --> 07:52:36,800
remained certain

29127
07:52:36,800 --> 07:52:37,860
that all employment

29128
07:52:37,860 --> 07:52:39,000
was impossible to one

29129
07:52:39,000 --> 07:52:40,200
so wretched as herself.

29130
07:52:40,560 --> 07:52:41,480
But she had her share

29131
07:52:41,480 --> 07:52:42,020
of business

29132
07:52:42,020 --> 07:52:43,140
as well as her aunt.

29133
07:52:43,140 --> 07:52:44,340
And amongst the rest

29134
07:52:44,340 --> 07:52:45,120
notes to be written

29135
07:52:45,120 --> 07:52:45,980
to all their friends

29136
07:52:45,980 --> 07:52:47,360
at Lampton with false

29137
07:52:47,360 --> 07:52:48,060
excuses

29138
07:52:48,060 --> 07:52:48,300
for their

29139
07:52:48,300 --> 07:52:49,500
sudden departure.

29140
07:52:49,700 --> 07:52:50,780
An hour, however, saw

29141
07:52:50,780 --> 07:52:51,980
the whole completed

29142
07:52:51,980 --> 07:52:52,440
and Mr.

29143
07:52:52,440 --> 07:52:52,860
Gardiner,

29144
07:52:52,860 --> 07:52:53,480
meanwhile having

29145
07:52:53,480 --> 07:52:54,180
settled his account

29146
07:52:54,180 --> 07:52:54,980
at the end.

29147
07:52:54,980 --> 07:52:55,700
Nothing remained

29148
07:52:55,700 --> 07:52:56,900
to be done but to go.

29149
07:52:57,300 --> 07:52:58,280
And Elizabeth,

29150
07:52:58,280 --> 07:52:58,880
after all

29151
07:52:58,880 --> 07:52:59,340
the misery

29152
07:52:59,340 --> 07:53:00,240
of the morning,

29153
07:53:00,240 --> 07:53:00,980
found herself

29154
07:53:00,980 --> 07:53:01,440
in a shorter

29155
07:53:01,440 --> 07:53:02,100
space of time

29156
07:53:02,100 --> 07:53:02,540
that she could have.

29157
07:53:02,540 --> 07:53:03,320
Supposed.

29158
07:53:03,320 --> 07:53:04,520
Seated the carriage

29159
07:53:04,520 --> 07:53:04,880
and on

29160
07:53:04,880 --> 07:53:06,120
the road to London.

29161
07:53:08,240 --> 07:53:09,440
Chapter 47.

29162
07:53:10,760 --> 07:53:11,280
I have been

29163
07:53:11,280 --> 07:53:12,200
thinking it over again.

29164
07:53:12,200 --> 07:53:13,280
Elizabeth said

29165
07:53:13,280 --> 07:53:13,800
her uncle,

29166
07:53:13,800 --> 07:53:14,280
as they drove

29167
07:53:14,280 --> 07:53:15,420
from the town.

29168
07:53:15,420 --> 07:53:16,520
And really, upon

29169
07:53:16,520 --> 07:53:17,760
serious consideration,

29170
07:53:18,000 --> 07:53:19,320
I am much more inclined

29171
07:53:19,320 --> 07:53:19,980
than I was

29172
07:53:19,980 --> 07:53:20,400
to judge,

29173
07:53:20,400 --> 07:53:21,360
as your eldest sister

29174
07:53:21,360 --> 07:53:22,560
does, on the matter.

29175
07:53:22,640 --> 07:53:23,420
It appears to me

29176
07:53:23,420 --> 07:53:24,300
so very unlikely

29177
07:53:24,300 --> 07:53:25,040
that any young man

29178
07:53:25,040 --> 07:53:25,520
should form

29179
07:53:25,520 --> 07:53:26,180
such a design

29180
07:53:26,180 --> 07:53:27,120
against a girl

29181
07:53:27,120 --> 07:53:28,100
who is by means

29182
07:53:28,100 --> 07:53:28,760
unprotected

29183
07:53:28,760 --> 07:53:29,660
or friendless,

29184
07:53:29,660 --> 07:53:30,120
and who is

29185
07:53:30,120 --> 07:53:30,960
actually staying

29186
07:53:30,960 --> 07:53:32,160
in his colonel's family,

29187
07:53:32,240 --> 07:53:32,600
that I am

29188
07:53:32,600 --> 07:53:33,420
strongly inclined

29189
07:53:33,420 --> 07:53:34,620
to hope the best.

29190
07:53:34,760 --> 07:53:35,520
Could he expect

29191
07:53:35,520 --> 07:53:36,020
that her friends

29192
07:53:36,020 --> 07:53:37,220
would not step forward?

29193
07:53:37,340 --> 07:53:38,180
Could he expect

29194
07:53:38,180 --> 07:53:39,020
to be noticed again

29195
07:53:39,020 --> 07:53:39,680
by the regiment

29196
07:53:39,680 --> 07:53:40,520
after such an affront

29197
07:53:40,520 --> 07:53:41,720
to Colonel Foster?

29198
07:53:41,820 --> 07:53:42,600
His temptation

29199
07:53:42,600 --> 07:53:43,260
is not adequate

29200
07:53:43,260 --> 07:53:44,460
to the risk.

29201
07:53:44,760 --> 07:53:45,960
Do you really think so?

29202
07:53:46,220 --> 07:53:47,060
Cried Elizabeth,

29203
07:53:47,060 --> 07:53:47,660
brightening up

29204
07:53:47,660 --> 07:53:48,860
for a moment.

29205
07:53:49,020 --> 07:53:50,220
Upon my word.

29206
07:53:50,340 --> 07:53:50,840
Said Mrs.

29207
07:53:50,840 --> 07:53:51,680
Gardiner.

29208
07:53:51,680 --> 07:53:52,460
I begin to be of

29209
07:53:52,460 --> 07:53:53,660
your uncle's opinion.

29210
07:53:53,780 --> 07:53:54,920
It is really too great

29211
07:53:54,920 --> 07:53:55,520
a violation

29212
07:53:55,520 --> 07:53:56,600
of decency, honor

29213
07:53:56,600 --> 07:53:57,800
and for him

29214
07:53:57,800 --> 07:53:59,000
to be guilty of.

29215
07:53:59,060 --> 07:53:59,940
I cannot think so.

29216
07:53:59,940 --> 07:54:01,140
Very ill of Wickham.

29217
07:54:01,160 --> 07:54:02,100
Can you yourself,

29218
07:54:02,100 --> 07:54:02,400
Lizzie,

29219
07:54:02,400 --> 07:54:03,560
so wholly give him up?

29220
07:54:03,560 --> 07:54:03,860
Has to

29221
07:54:03,860 --> 07:54:04,220
believe I am

29222
07:54:04,220 --> 07:54:05,100
capable of it.

29223
07:54:06,120 --> 07:54:07,160
Not Perhaps of

29224
07:54:07,160 --> 07:54:07,800
neglecting his

29225
07:54:07,800 --> 07:54:08,660
own interest,

29226
07:54:08,660 --> 07:54:09,260
but of every

29227
07:54:09,260 --> 07:54:09,920
other neglect.

29228
07:54:09,920 --> 07:54:10,740
I can believe him

29229
07:54:10,740 --> 07:54:12,320
capable, if indeed

29230
07:54:12,320 --> 07:54:13,520
it should be so.

29231
07:54:13,880 --> 07:54:15,080
But I dare not hope it.

29232
07:54:15,560 --> 07:54:16,380
Why should they not

29233
07:54:16,380 --> 07:54:17,240
go on to Scotland

29234
07:54:17,240 --> 07:54:17,580
if that had

29235
07:54:17,580 --> 07:54:18,780
been the case.

29236
07:54:18,860 --> 07:54:20,060
In the first place?

29237
07:54:20,360 --> 07:54:21,020
Replied Mr.

29238
07:54:21,020 --> 07:54:22,020
Gardner.

29239
07:54:22,020 --> 07:54:22,500
There is no

29240
07:54:22,500 --> 07:54:23,220
absolute proof

29241
07:54:23,220 --> 07:54:24,000
that they are not gone

29242
07:54:24,000 --> 07:54:25,200
to Scotland.

29243
07:54:25,340 --> 07:54:26,520
Oh, but they're removing

29244
07:54:26,520 --> 07:54:26,940
the shares

29245
07:54:26,940 --> 07:54:27,840
and into a Hackney coach

29246
07:54:27,840 --> 07:54:29,040
is such a presumption.

29247
07:54:29,280 --> 07:54:30,240
And besides, no.

29248
07:54:30,240 --> 07:54:30,980
Traces of them

29249
07:54:30,980 --> 07:54:31,640
were to be found

29250
07:54:31,640 --> 07:54:32,840
on the Barnet Road.

29251
07:54:34,440 --> 07:54:35,400
Well, then,

29252
07:54:35,400 --> 07:54:36,200
supposing them

29253
07:54:36,200 --> 07:54:37,400
be in London.

29254
07:54:38,060 --> 07:54:38,580
They may be

29255
07:54:38,580 --> 07:54:39,140
there, though,

29256
07:54:39,140 --> 07:54:39,720
for the purpose

29257
07:54:39,720 --> 07:54:40,460
of concealment

29258
07:54:40,460 --> 07:54:41,000
for no more

29259
07:54:41,000 --> 07:54:42,260
exceptional purpose.

29260
07:54:43,880 --> 07:54:44,760
It is not likely

29261
07:54:44,760 --> 07:54:45,180
that money

29262
07:54:45,180 --> 07:54:46,500
should be very on either

29263
07:54:46,500 --> 07:54:47,700
side.

29264
07:54:48,260 --> 07:54:49,340
And it might strike them

29265
07:54:49,340 --> 07:54:50,040
that they could be

29266
07:54:50,040 --> 07:54:51,020
more economically,

29267
07:54:51,020 --> 07:54:51,500
though

29268
07:54:51,500 --> 07:54:52,760
less expeditiously

29269
07:54:52,980 --> 07:54:54,180
married in London

29270
07:54:54,200 --> 07:54:55,140
than in Scotland.

29271
07:54:56,160 --> 07:54:56,900
But why all

29272
07:54:56,900 --> 07:54:58,100
this secrecy?

29273
07:54:58,260 --> 07:54:58,740
Why any

29274
07:54:58,740 --> 07:54:59,940
fear of detection?

29275
07:55:00,140 --> 07:55:01,280
Why must their marriage

29276
07:55:01,280 --> 07:55:02,480
be private?

29277
07:55:02,580 --> 07:55:03,540
Oh, no, no.

29278
07:55:03,540 --> 07:55:04,740
This is not likely.

29279
07:55:05,220 --> 07:55:06,460
Most particular friend,

29280
07:55:06,500 --> 07:55:07,200
you see, by

29281
07:55:07,200 --> 07:55:07,980
Jean's account

29282
07:55:07,980 --> 07:55:08,760
was persuaded

29283
07:55:08,760 --> 07:55:08,960
of his

29284
07:55:08,960 --> 07:55:09,680
never intending

29285
07:55:09,680 --> 07:55:10,640
to marry her.

29286
07:55:10,640 --> 07:55:11,480
Wickham will never

29287
07:55:11,480 --> 07:55:12,080
marry a woman

29288
07:55:12,080 --> 07:55:13,200
without some money.

29289
07:55:13,200 --> 07:55:14,400
He cannot afford it.

29290
07:55:14,760 --> 07:55:15,780
And What claims

29291
07:55:15,780 --> 07:55:16,740
has Lydia?

29292
07:55:16,740 --> 07:55:17,840
What attraction has

29293
07:55:17,840 --> 07:55:19,220
she beyond youth health

29294
07:55:19,220 --> 07:55:19,940
and good humor

29295
07:55:19,940 --> 07:55:20,960
that could make him,

29296
07:55:20,960 --> 07:55:22,260
for her sake, forego.

29297
07:55:22,260 --> 07:55:22,980
Every chance

29298
07:55:22,980 --> 07:55:24,000
of benefiting himself.

29299
07:55:24,000 --> 07:55:24,620
By marrying?

29300
07:55:24,620 --> 07:55:25,820
Well

29301
07:55:26,540 --> 07:55:27,680
As to what restraint

29302
07:55:27,680 --> 07:55:28,560
the apprehensions

29303
07:55:28,560 --> 07:55:29,240
of disgrace

29304
07:55:29,240 --> 07:55:30,200
in the Corps might throw

29305
07:55:30,200 --> 07:55:30,900
on dishonorable

29306
07:55:30,900 --> 07:55:32,000
elopement with her.

29307
07:55:32,000 --> 07:55:32,580
I am not able

29308
07:55:32,580 --> 07:55:33,660
to judge, for

29309
07:55:33,660 --> 07:55:34,280
I know nothing

29310
07:55:34,280 --> 07:55:34,880
of the effect

29311
07:55:34,880 --> 07:55:35,580
that such a step

29312
07:55:35,580 --> 07:55:36,780
might produce.

29313
07:55:37,560 --> 07:55:38,120
But as to your

29314
07:55:38,120 --> 07:55:39,320
other objection,

29315
07:55:39,340 --> 07:55:39,900
I am afraid

29316
07:55:39,900 --> 07:55:40,800
it will hardly hold.

29317
07:55:40,800 --> 07:55:41,640
Good.

29318
07:55:41,640 --> 07:55:43,040
Lydia has no brothers

29319
07:55:43,040 --> 07:55:44,120
to step forward,

29320
07:55:44,120 --> 07:55:44,640
and he might

29321
07:55:44,640 --> 07:55:45,180
imagine for.

29322
07:55:45,180 --> 07:55:45,740
My father's.

29323
07:55:45,740 --> 07:55:46,520
Behavior

29324
07:55:46,520 --> 07:55:47,420
from his indolence

29325
07:55:47,420 --> 07:55:47,600
and the.

29326
07:55:47,600 --> 07:55:48,440
Little attention he's

29327
07:55:48,440 --> 07:55:49,200
ever seemed to give to.

29328
07:55:49,200 --> 07:55:50,040
What was going forward

29329
07:55:50,040 --> 07:55:50,900
in his family,

29330
07:55:50,900 --> 07:55:51,480
that he would

29331
07:55:51,480 --> 07:55:52,680
do as little.

29332
07:55:52,800 --> 07:55:53,460
And think as

29333
07:55:53,460 --> 07:55:54,660
little about it as any

29334
07:55:54,800 --> 07:55:55,500
could do in such.

29335
07:55:55,500 --> 07:55:56,000
A matter.

29336
07:55:57,560 --> 07:55:58,560
But can you think that

29337
07:55:58,560 --> 07:55:58,940
Lydia

29338
07:55:58,940 --> 07:56:00,120
so lost to everything

29339
07:56:00,120 --> 07:56:01,100
but love of him

29340
07:56:01,100 --> 07:56:01,860
as to consent,

29341
07:56:01,860 --> 07:56:02,520
to live with him

29342
07:56:02,520 --> 07:56:03,080
in any terms

29343
07:56:03,080 --> 07:56:04,280
other than marriage?

29344
07:56:04,880 --> 07:56:06,080
It does seem,

29345
07:56:06,180 --> 07:56:06,980
and it is most

29346
07:56:06,980 --> 07:56:08,180
shocking indeed.

29347
07:56:08,360 --> 07:56:09,240
Replied Elizabeth,

29348
07:56:09,240 --> 07:56:10,440
with tears in her eyes.

29349
07:56:10,880 --> 07:56:11,660
That a sister's

29350
07:56:11,660 --> 07:56:12,840
sense of decency

29351
07:56:12,840 --> 07:56:13,440
and virtue

29352
07:56:13,440 --> 07:56:14,160
in such a point

29353
07:56:14,160 --> 07:56:15,360
could admit of doubt.

29354
07:56:15,860 --> 07:56:16,700
But really, I know

29355
07:56:16,700 --> 07:56:17,900
not what to say.

29356
07:56:18,080 --> 07:56:19,020
Perhaps I am not

29357
07:56:19,020 --> 07:56:20,220
doing her justice.

29358
07:56:20,480 --> 07:56:21,680
But she is very young.

29359
07:56:21,900 --> 07:56:22,400
She has never

29360
07:56:22,400 --> 07:56:23,280
been taught to think

29361
07:56:23,280 --> 07:56:24,480
on a serious.

29362
07:56:24,740 --> 07:56:25,320
And for the

29363
07:56:25,320 --> 07:56:26,520
last half year,

29364
07:56:26,760 --> 07:56:27,980
nay, for 12 month,

29365
07:56:28,220 --> 07:56:29,220
she has been given up

29366
07:56:29,220 --> 07:56:30,660
to nothing but amusement

29367
07:56:30,660 --> 07:56:31,820
and to vanity.

29368
07:56:31,820 --> 07:56:32,600
She's been allowed

29369
07:56:32,600 --> 07:56:33,720
to dispose of her time

29370
07:56:33,720 --> 07:56:34,560
in the most idle

29371
07:56:34,560 --> 07:56:35,760
and frivolous manner

29372
07:56:35,960 --> 07:56:36,780
and to adopt

29373
07:56:36,780 --> 07:56:37,520
any opinions.

29374
07:56:37,520 --> 07:56:38,060
That came in.

29375
07:56:38,060 --> 07:56:39,860
Her way since the Blank

29376
07:56:40,020 --> 07:56:40,800
were first courted

29377
07:56:40,800 --> 07:56:41,580
in Britain.

29378
07:56:41,580 --> 07:56:42,120
Nothing but

29379
07:56:42,120 --> 07:56:43,160
love, flirtation,

29380
07:56:43,160 --> 07:56:43,800
and officers

29381
07:56:43,800 --> 07:56:44,940
have been in her head.

29382
07:56:44,940 --> 07:56:45,380
She has been

29383
07:56:45,380 --> 07:56:46,100
doing everything

29384
07:56:46,100 --> 07:56:46,640
in her power

29385
07:56:46,640 --> 07:56:47,180
by thinking.

29386
07:56:47,180 --> 07:56:47,720
And talking

29387
07:56:47,720 --> 07:56:48,560
on the subject

29388
07:56:48,560 --> 07:56:49,760
to give greater,

29389
07:56:49,860 --> 07:56:51,060
what shall I call it,

29390
07:56:51,140 --> 07:56:52,320
susceptibility to her

29391
07:56:52,320 --> 07:56:52,860
feelings,

29392
07:56:52,860 --> 07:56:53,580
which naturally

29393
07:56:53,580 --> 07:56:54,780
lively enough.

29394
07:56:54,800 --> 07:56:55,860
And we all know that

29395
07:56:55,860 --> 07:56:57,180
Wickham has every charm

29396
07:56:57,180 --> 07:56:58,340
of person and address

29397
07:56:58,340 --> 07:56:58,620
that can

29398
07:56:58,620 --> 07:56:59,600
captivate a woman.

29399
07:57:00,680 --> 07:57:01,680
But do you see that?

29400
07:57:01,680 --> 07:57:03,140
Jane said her Aunt.

29401
07:57:03,480 --> 07:57:04,560
Just not thinks a very

29402
07:57:04,560 --> 07:57:05,220
ill of Wickham

29403
07:57:05,220 --> 07:57:05,720
as to believe

29404
07:57:05,720 --> 07:57:06,320
and capable

29405
07:57:06,320 --> 07:57:07,520
of the attempt.

29406
07:57:07,880 --> 07:57:08,480
Of whom does

29407
07:57:08,480 --> 07:57:09,860
Jane ever think ill?

29408
07:57:10,280 --> 07:57:11,340
And who is there?

29409
07:57:11,340 --> 07:57:12,120
Whatever might be

29410
07:57:12,120 --> 07:57:13,320
that form of conduct

29411
07:57:13,400 --> 07:57:14,100
that she would think

29412
07:57:14,100 --> 07:57:14,720
capable of

29413
07:57:14,720 --> 07:57:15,720
such an attempt

29414
07:57:15,720 --> 07:57:16,620
till it were proved

29415
07:57:16,620 --> 07:57:17,820
against them?

29416
07:57:18,000 --> 07:57:19,100
But Jane knows.

29417
07:57:19,100 --> 07:57:20,180
As well as I do.

29418
07:57:20,180 --> 07:57:21,500
What Wickham really is.

29419
07:57:21,900 --> 07:57:22,580
We both know

29420
07:57:22,580 --> 07:57:22,980
that he has

29421
07:57:22,980 --> 07:57:23,700
been profligate

29422
07:57:23,700 --> 07:57:24,540
in every sense

29423
07:57:24,540 --> 07:57:25,340
of the word,

29424
07:57:25,340 --> 07:57:25,700
but he has

29425
07:57:25,700 --> 07:57:26,660
neither integrity

29426
07:57:26,660 --> 07:57:28,100
nor honor that he is

29427
07:57:28,100 --> 07:57:29,480
as false and deceitful

29428
07:57:29,480 --> 07:57:30,680
as he is insinuating.

29429
07:57:31,620 --> 07:57:32,660
And do you really know

29430
07:57:32,660 --> 07:57:34,320
all this kind, Mrs.

29431
07:57:34,320 --> 07:57:35,000
Gardiner?

29432
07:57:35,000 --> 07:57:35,900
His curiosity

29433
07:57:35,900 --> 07:57:36,740
as to the mode of her

29434
07:57:36,740 --> 07:57:37,520
intelligence was

29435
07:57:37,520 --> 07:57:38,720
all alive?

29436
07:57:39,000 --> 07:57:40,200
I do indeed.

29437
07:57:40,200 --> 07:57:40,580
Replied

29438
07:57:40,580 --> 07:57:41,780
Elizabeth Coloring.

29439
07:57:42,000 --> 07:57:42,980
I Told you the other.

29440
07:57:42,980 --> 07:57:43,940
Day of his infamous

29441
07:57:43,940 --> 07:57:44,480
behavior to.

29442
07:57:44,480 --> 07:57:45,680
Mr. Darcy.

29443
07:57:45,720 --> 07:57:46,820
And you yourself,

29444
07:57:46,820 --> 07:57:48,300
when last at long boon

29445
07:57:48,500 --> 07:57:49,560
heard, in what manner?

29446
07:57:49,560 --> 07:57:50,480
He spoke of the man

29447
07:57:50,480 --> 07:57:51,180
who had behaved

29448
07:57:51,180 --> 07:57:52,380
with such forbearance

29449
07:57:52,400 --> 07:57:53,720
liberality towards him.

29450
07:57:54,360 --> 07:57:54,960
And there are

29451
07:57:54,960 --> 07:57:56,060
other circumstances

29452
07:57:56,060 --> 07:57:56,600
which I am not

29453
07:57:56,600 --> 07:57:58,020
at liberty, which

29454
07:57:58,020 --> 07:57:58,980
it is not worthwhile

29455
07:57:58,980 --> 07:58:00,000
to relate.

29456
07:58:00,000 --> 07:58:00,380
But his.

29457
07:58:00,380 --> 07:58:01,040
Lies about.

29458
07:58:01,040 --> 07:58:01,380
The whole

29459
07:58:01,380 --> 07:58:02,580
Pemberley family

29460
07:58:02,580 --> 07:58:03,620
Endless.

29461
07:58:03,620 --> 07:58:04,460
From what he said of

29462
07:58:04,460 --> 07:58:05,120
Miss Darcy,

29463
07:58:05,120 --> 07:58:05,780
I was thoroughly

29464
07:58:05,780 --> 07:58:06,180
prepared

29465
07:58:06,180 --> 07:58:06,920
to see a proud,

29466
07:58:06,920 --> 07:58:07,520
reserved,

29467
07:58:07,520 --> 07:58:08,720
disagreeable girl.

29468
07:58:09,020 --> 07:58:09,800
Yet he knew

29469
07:58:09,800 --> 07:58:11,000
to the contrary himself.

29470
07:58:11,220 --> 07:58:12,060
He must know.

29471
07:58:12,060 --> 07:58:13,140
That was as amiable

29472
07:58:13,140 --> 07:58:13,440
and on

29473
07:58:13,440 --> 07:58:14,040
pretending as

29474
07:58:14,040 --> 07:58:14,880
we have found. Her.

29475
07:58:15,860 --> 07:58:16,220
But does

29476
07:58:16,220 --> 07:58:16,680
Lydia know

29477
07:58:16,680 --> 07:58:17,660
nothing of this?

29478
07:58:17,660 --> 07:58:18,680
Can she be as ignorant

29479
07:58:18,680 --> 07:58:19,000
of what

29480
07:58:19,000 --> 07:58:19,880
you and Jane seem so

29481
07:58:19,880 --> 07:58:21,080
well to understand?

29482
07:58:21,920 --> 07:58:23,280
Yes That is

29483
07:58:23,280 --> 07:58:24,480
the worst of it all.

29484
07:58:24,960 --> 07:58:26,040
Till I was in Kent

29485
07:58:26,040 --> 07:58:26,900
and saw so much.

29486
07:58:26,900 --> 07:58:27,440
Both of Mr.

29487
07:58:27,440 --> 07:58:28,560
Darcy and his relation,

29488
07:58:28,560 --> 07:58:29,760
Colonel Fitzwilliam.

29489
07:58:29,760 --> 07:58:30,480
I was ignorant

29490
07:58:30,480 --> 07:58:31,680
of the truth myself.

29491
07:58:32,060 --> 07:58:33,300
And when I returned home

29492
07:58:33,500 --> 07:58:33,960
the blank,

29493
07:58:33,960 --> 07:58:34,580
she was to leave.

29494
07:58:34,580 --> 07:58:35,340
Married in a week

29495
07:58:35,340 --> 07:58:36,540
or fortnight's time,

29496
07:58:36,860 --> 07:58:37,760
as that was the case.

29497
07:58:37,760 --> 07:58:39,060
Neither Jane, to whom

29498
07:58:39,060 --> 07:58:40,440
I related the whole nor

29499
07:58:40,440 --> 07:58:41,480
I thought it necessary

29500
07:58:41,480 --> 07:58:41,900
to make our

29501
07:58:41,900 --> 07:58:43,100
knowledge public

29502
07:58:43,280 --> 07:58:44,100
for what to use.

29503
07:58:44,100 --> 07:58:44,340
Could it

29504
07:58:44,340 --> 07:58:45,600
apparently be to anyone

29505
07:58:45,740 --> 07:58:46,880
that the good opinion,

29506
07:58:46,880 --> 07:58:47,220
which all

29507
07:58:47,220 --> 07:58:47,820
the neighborhood

29508
07:58:47,820 --> 07:58:48,320
had of him,

29509
07:58:48,320 --> 07:58:48,660
should then

29510
07:58:48,660 --> 07:58:49,860
be overthrown?

29511
07:58:49,920 --> 07:58:50,540
And even when

29512
07:58:50,540 --> 07:58:51,120
it was settled

29513
07:58:51,120 --> 07:58:51,960
that Lydia should go

29514
07:58:51,960 --> 07:58:52,380
with Mrs.

29515
07:58:52,380 --> 07:58:53,780
Forster, the necessity

29516
07:58:53,780 --> 07:58:54,660
of opening her eyes

29517
07:58:54,660 --> 07:58:55,280
to his character

29518
07:58:55,280 --> 07:58:56,480
never occurred to me

29519
07:58:56,640 --> 07:58:57,440
that she could be

29520
07:58:57,440 --> 07:58:58,200
in any danger.

29521
07:58:58,200 --> 07:58:58,860
From the deception.

29522
07:58:58,860 --> 07:59:00,060
Never entered my head

29523
07:59:00,500 --> 07:59:01,560
that such a consequence

29524
07:59:01,560 --> 07:59:02,780
as this could ensue,

29525
07:59:02,960 --> 07:59:03,800
you may easily

29526
07:59:03,800 --> 07:59:04,320
believe, was

29527
07:59:04,320 --> 07:59:04,980
far enough from

29528
07:59:04,980 --> 07:59:05,700
my thoughts

29529
07:59:06,720 --> 07:59:07,260
when they all

29530
07:59:07,260 --> 07:59:08,060
removed to Brighton.

29531
07:59:08,060 --> 07:59:08,540
Therefore you

29532
07:59:08,540 --> 07:59:09,240
had no reason,

29533
07:59:09,240 --> 07:59:09,660
I suppose

29534
07:59:09,660 --> 07:59:10,140
to believe them

29535
07:59:10,140 --> 07:59:11,340
fond of each other.

29536
07:59:11,700 --> 07:59:12,900
Not the slightest.

29537
07:59:13,220 --> 07:59:13,800
I can remember

29538
07:59:13,800 --> 07:59:14,900
no symptom of affection

29539
07:59:14,900 --> 07:59:16,040
on either side.

29540
07:59:16,040 --> 07:59:16,820
And had anything

29541
07:59:16,820 --> 07:59:17,300
of the kind

29542
07:59:17,300 --> 07:59:18,320
been perceptible.

29543
07:59:18,320 --> 07:59:19,200
You must be aware

29544
07:59:19,200 --> 07:59:19,800
that ours is

29545
07:59:19,800 --> 07:59:20,420
not a family

29546
07:59:20,420 --> 07:59:20,700
on which

29547
07:59:20,700 --> 07:59:21,900
it could be thrown away.

29548
07:59:22,040 --> 07:59:22,640
When first

29549
07:59:22,640 --> 07:59:23,640
he entered the Corps.

29550
07:59:23,640 --> 07:59:24,140
She was ready

29551
07:59:24,140 --> 07:59:25,340
enough to admire him.

29552
07:59:25,380 --> 07:59:25,620
But.

29553
07:59:25,620 --> 07:59:26,820
So we all were.

29554
07:59:26,940 --> 07:59:28,640
Every girl in or near

29555
07:59:28,640 --> 07:59:29,060
Meriton

29556
07:59:29,060 --> 07:59:30,180
was out of her senses

29557
07:59:30,180 --> 07:59:30,540
about him.

29558
07:59:30,540 --> 07:59:30,720
For the

29559
07:59:30,720 --> 07:59:31,920
first two months,

29560
07:59:32,060 --> 07:59:32,520
but he never

29561
07:59:32,520 --> 07:59:33,740
distinguished her by any

29562
07:59:33,740 --> 07:59:34,940
particular attention.

29563
07:59:35,160 --> 07:59:36,180
And consequently,

29564
07:59:36,180 --> 07:59:36,560
after a.

29565
07:59:36,560 --> 07:59:37,380
Moderate period

29566
07:59:37,380 --> 07:59:38,600
of extravagant and wild.

29567
07:59:38,600 --> 07:59:40,140
Admiration, her fancy

29568
07:59:40,140 --> 07:59:40,440
for him

29569
07:59:40,440 --> 07:59:41,900
gave way and others

29570
07:59:41,900 --> 07:59:42,600
of the regiment

29571
07:59:42,600 --> 07:59:43,400
who treated her

29572
07:59:43,400 --> 07:59:44,600
with more distinction

29573
07:59:44,600 --> 07:59:45,500
again became

29574
07:59:45,500 --> 07:59:46,320
her favorites.

29575
07:59:47,640 --> 07:59:48,300
It may be.

29576
07:59:48,300 --> 07:59:48,740
Easily.

29577
07:59:48,740 --> 07:59:50,040
Believed that however.

29578
07:59:50,040 --> 07:59:50,960
Little of novelty

29579
07:59:50,960 --> 07:59:51,620
could be added.

29580
07:59:51,620 --> 07:59:52,580
Their fears, hopes

29581
07:59:52,580 --> 07:59:53,480
and conjectures

29582
07:59:53,480 --> 07:59:54,240
on this interesting.

29583
07:59:54,240 --> 07:59:54,980
Subject

29584
07:59:54,980 --> 07:59:55,400
by its

29585
07:59:55,400 --> 07:59:56,600
repeated discussion.

29586
07:59:56,780 --> 07:59:57,420
No other

29587
07:59:57,420 --> 07:59:58,200
could detain them

29588
07:59:58,200 --> 07:59:58,500
from it

29589
07:59:58,500 --> 07:59:59,480
long during

29590
07:59:59,480 --> 08:00:00,680
the whole of the journey

29591
08:00:00,960 --> 08:00:02,100
from Elizabeth,

29592
08:00:02,100 --> 08:00:03,300
it was never absent

29593
08:00:03,500 --> 08:00:04,220
fixed there

29594
08:00:04,220 --> 08:00:04,940
by the keenest

29595
08:00:04,940 --> 08:00:05,880
of all anguish,

29596
08:00:05,880 --> 08:00:07,020
self reproach.

29597
08:00:07,020 --> 08:00:07,680
She could find.

29598
08:00:07,680 --> 08:00:08,780
No interval of ease

29599
08:00:08,780 --> 08:00:09,980
or forgetfulness.

29600
08:00:10,580 --> 08:00:11,180
They traveled

29601
08:00:11,180 --> 08:00:12,140
as expeditious

29602
08:00:12,140 --> 08:00:13,020
as possible

29603
08:00:13,020 --> 08:00:13,700
and sleeping

29604
08:00:13,700 --> 08:00:14,840
one night on the road

29605
08:00:14,840 --> 08:00:15,840
reached long borne

29606
08:00:15,840 --> 08:00:16,520
by dinnertime

29607
08:00:16,520 --> 08:00:17,720
the next day.

29608
08:00:17,820 --> 08:00:18,600
It was a comfort

29609
08:00:18,600 --> 08:00:19,140
to Elizabeth

29610
08:00:19,140 --> 08:00:19,740
to consider that

29611
08:00:19,740 --> 08:00:20,360
Jane could not

29612
08:00:20,360 --> 08:00:21,060
have been wearied

29613
08:00:21,060 --> 08:00:22,260
by long expectation.

29614
08:00:22,700 --> 08:00:23,700
The little gardener's,

29615
08:00:23,700 --> 08:00:24,200
attracted

29616
08:00:24,200 --> 08:00:24,680
by the sight

29617
08:00:24,680 --> 08:00:25,400
of his shares,

29618
08:00:25,400 --> 08:00:26,000
were standing

29619
08:00:26,000 --> 08:00:26,540
on the steps

29620
08:00:26,540 --> 08:00:27,060
of the house

29621
08:00:27,060 --> 08:00:27,560
as they entered

29622
08:00:27,560 --> 08:00:28,340
the paddock,

29623
08:00:28,340 --> 08:00:29,100
and when the carriage

29624
08:00:29,100 --> 08:00:30,140
drove up to the door,

29625
08:00:30,140 --> 08:00:31,140
the joyful surprise

29626
08:00:31,140 --> 08:00:31,740
that lighted up

29627
08:00:31,740 --> 08:00:32,600
their faces

29628
08:00:32,600 --> 08:00:33,540
and displayed itself

29629
08:00:33,540 --> 08:00:34,680
over their whole bodies

29630
08:00:34,680 --> 08:00:36,000
in a variety of capers

29631
08:00:36,000 --> 08:00:36,800
and frisks

29632
08:00:36,800 --> 08:00:37,920
was the first pleasing

29633
08:00:37,920 --> 08:00:38,340
earnest

29634
08:00:38,340 --> 08:00:39,540
of their welcome.

29635
08:00:39,600 --> 08:00:40,800
Elizabeth jumped out,

29636
08:00:40,940 --> 08:00:41,940
and after giving each

29637
08:00:41,940 --> 08:00:43,140
of them, a hasty kiss

29638
08:00:43,200 --> 08:00:43,740
hurried into

29639
08:00:43,740 --> 08:00:44,940
the vestibule, where

29640
08:00:44,940 --> 08:00:45,380
Jane,

29641
08:00:45,380 --> 08:00:46,260
who came running down

29642
08:00:46,260 --> 08:00:46,760
from her mother's

29643
08:00:46,760 --> 08:00:48,060
apartment, immediately

29644
08:00:48,060 --> 08:00:49,700
met her Elizabeth,

29645
08:00:49,700 --> 08:00:50,580
as she affectionately

29646
08:00:50,580 --> 08:00:51,380
embraced her,

29647
08:00:51,380 --> 08:00:52,280
whilst tears

29648
08:00:52,280 --> 08:00:52,980
filled the eyes of.

29649
08:00:52,980 --> 08:00:54,680
Both lost not a moment.

29650
08:00:54,680 --> 08:00:55,200
And asking

29651
08:00:55,200 --> 08:00:55,800
whether anything

29652
08:00:55,800 --> 08:00:56,540
had been heard of.

29653
08:00:56,540 --> 08:00:57,740
Fugitives.

29654
08:00:57,900 --> 08:00:58,860
Not yet,

29655
08:00:58,860 --> 08:01:00,020
replied Jane.

29656
08:01:00,020 --> 08:01:00,500
But now that

29657
08:01:00,500 --> 08:01:01,340
my dear uncle,

29658
08:01:01,340 --> 08:01:01,580
come,

29659
08:01:01,580 --> 08:01:01,860
I hope

29660
08:01:01,860 --> 08:01:03,060
everything will be well.

29661
08:01:03,560 --> 08:01:04,760
Is my father in town?

29662
08:01:05,360 --> 08:01:05,820
Yes.

29663
08:01:05,820 --> 08:01:06,740
He went on Tuesday,

29664
08:01:06,740 --> 08:01:07,280
as I wrote you.

29665
08:01:07,280 --> 08:01:08,360
Word.

29666
08:01:08,360 --> 08:01:09,140
And have you heard

29667
08:01:09,140 --> 08:01:10,340
from him often?

29668
08:01:10,440 --> 08:01:11,760
We have heard twice.

29669
08:01:12,080 --> 08:01:12,620
He wrote to me

29670
08:01:12,620 --> 08:01:13,380
a few lines on.

29671
08:01:13,380 --> 08:01:14,180
Wednesday to say that

29672
08:01:14,180 --> 08:01:14,700
he had arrived

29673
08:01:14,700 --> 08:01:15,540
in. Safety

29674
08:01:15,540 --> 08:01:16,100
and to give me

29675
08:01:16,100 --> 08:01:17,000
his directions,

29676
08:01:17,000 --> 08:01:17,940
which I particularly

29677
08:01:17,940 --> 08:01:19,140
begged him to do.

29678
08:01:19,280 --> 08:01:20,160
He merely added

29679
08:01:20,160 --> 08:01:20,700
that he should

29680
08:01:20,700 --> 08:01:21,380
write again

29681
08:01:21,380 --> 08:01:22,140
till he had something

29682
08:01:22,140 --> 08:01:22,760
of importance

29683
08:01:22,760 --> 08:01:23,960
to mention.

29684
08:01:24,180 --> 08:01:25,340
And my mother.

29685
08:01:25,340 --> 08:01:26,340
How is she?

29686
08:01:26,340 --> 08:01:27,540
How are you all?

29687
08:01:27,920 --> 08:01:28,500
My mother is

29688
08:01:28,500 --> 08:01:29,360
tolerably well.

29689
08:01:29,360 --> 08:01:30,500
I trust, though

29690
08:01:30,500 --> 08:01:31,140
his spirits are

29691
08:01:31,140 --> 08:01:32,340
greatly shaken.

29692
08:01:32,360 --> 08:01:33,240
She is upstairs.

29693
08:01:33,240 --> 08:01:33,560
And will have.

29694
08:01:33,560 --> 08:01:34,440
Great satisfaction

29695
08:01:34,440 --> 08:01:35,460
in seeing you all.

29696
08:01:35,460 --> 08:01:36,120
She does not yet

29697
08:01:36,120 --> 08:01:37,320
leave her dressing room.

29698
08:01:37,460 --> 08:01:38,660
Mary and Kitty, thank.

29699
08:01:38,660 --> 08:01:39,860
Heaven a quite well.

29700
08:01:40,500 --> 08:01:41,520
But you.

29701
08:01:41,520 --> 08:01:42,620
How are you?

29702
08:01:42,620 --> 08:01:43,800
Cried Elizabeth.

29703
08:01:43,800 --> 08:01:45,000
You look pale.

29704
08:01:45,060 --> 08:01:45,920
How much you must have

29705
08:01:45,920 --> 08:01:47,120
gone through?

29706
08:01:47,300 --> 08:01:47,880
Her sister,

29707
08:01:47,880 --> 08:01:48,740
however, assured her

29708
08:01:48,740 --> 08:01:49,940
of being perfectly well.

29709
08:01:50,040 --> 08:01:51,180
And their conversation,

29710
08:01:51,180 --> 08:01:52,020
which had been passing

29711
08:01:52,020 --> 08:01:52,880
while Mr. and Mrs.

29712
08:01:52,880 --> 08:01:53,780
Gardner were engaged

29713
08:01:53,780 --> 08:01:54,840
with their children,

29714
08:01:54,840 --> 08:01:55,880
was now put an end

29715
08:01:55,880 --> 08:01:56,760
to by the approach

29716
08:01:56,760 --> 08:01:57,960
of the whole party.

29717
08:01:57,980 --> 08:01:59,120
Jane ran to her uncle

29718
08:01:59,120 --> 08:02:00,440
and and welcomed

29719
08:02:00,440 --> 08:02:01,460
and thanked them both

29720
08:02:01,460 --> 08:02:02,720
with alternate smiles

29721
08:02:02,720 --> 08:02:03,920
and tears

29722
08:02:04,020 --> 08:02:04,700
when they were all

29723
08:02:04,700 --> 08:02:05,600
in the drawing room.

29724
08:02:05,600 --> 08:02:06,300
The questions

29725
08:02:06,300 --> 08:02:06,900
which Elizabeth

29726
08:02:06,900 --> 08:02:07,740
had already asked

29727
08:02:07,740 --> 08:02:08,300
were, of course,

29728
08:02:08,300 --> 08:02:09,500
repeated by the others,

29729
08:02:09,720 --> 08:02:10,860
and they soon found that

29730
08:02:10,860 --> 08:02:12,060
Jane had no intelligence

29731
08:02:12,060 --> 08:02:12,980
to give.

29732
08:02:12,980 --> 08:02:13,620
The sanguine

29733
08:02:13,620 --> 08:02:14,700
hope of good, however,

29734
08:02:14,700 --> 08:02:15,540
which the benevolence

29735
08:02:15,540 --> 08:02:16,620
of her heart suggested

29736
08:02:16,620 --> 08:02:17,240
had not yet

29737
08:02:17,240 --> 08:02:18,260
deserted her.

29738
08:02:18,260 --> 08:02:19,380
She still expected that

29739
08:02:19,380 --> 08:02:20,580
it would all end well,

29740
08:02:20,660 --> 08:02:21,720
and that every morning

29741
08:02:21,720 --> 08:02:22,860
would bring some letter

29742
08:02:22,860 --> 08:02:23,760
either from Lydia

29743
08:02:23,760 --> 08:02:24,680
or her father

29744
08:02:24,680 --> 08:02:25,380
to explain

29745
08:02:25,380 --> 08:02:26,280
their proceedings

29746
08:02:26,280 --> 08:02:27,600
and perhaps announce

29747
08:02:27,600 --> 08:02:28,800
their marriage.

29748
08:02:28,980 --> 08:02:29,360
Mrs.

29749
08:02:29,360 --> 08:02:29,880
Bennet, to

29750
08:02:29,880 --> 08:02:30,600
whose apartment

29751
08:02:30,600 --> 08:02:31,400
they all repaired

29752
08:02:31,400 --> 08:02:32,220
after a few minutes

29753
08:02:32,220 --> 08:02:33,420
conversation together,

29754
08:02:33,560 --> 08:02:34,740
received them exactly

29755
08:02:34,740 --> 08:02:35,940
as might be expected

29756
08:02:36,060 --> 08:02:36,800
with tears

29757
08:02:36,800 --> 08:02:37,640
and lamentations

29758
08:02:37,640 --> 08:02:38,840
of regret in

29759
08:02:39,240 --> 08:02:39,660
against the

29760
08:02:39,660 --> 08:02:40,580
villainous conduct

29761
08:02:40,580 --> 08:02:41,240
of Wickham.

29762
08:02:41,240 --> 08:02:41,520
And.

29763
08:02:41,520 --> 08:02:42,500
Complaints of her own

29764
08:02:42,500 --> 08:02:43,160
sufferings

29765
08:02:43,160 --> 08:02:44,360
and ill usage.

29766
08:02:44,420 --> 08:02:45,480
Blaming everybody

29767
08:02:45,480 --> 08:02:46,280
but the person to

29768
08:02:46,280 --> 08:02:46,800
whose ill

29769
08:02:46,800 --> 08:02:47,720
judging indulgence

29770
08:02:47,720 --> 08:02:48,320
the heirs of

29771
08:02:48,320 --> 08:02:48,800
her daughter

29772
08:02:48,800 --> 08:02:50,100
must principally be own.

29773
08:02:50,940 --> 08:02:52,620
If I had been able,

29774
08:02:52,920 --> 08:02:54,260
said she, to carry

29775
08:02:54,300 --> 08:02:54,800
my point

29776
08:02:54,800 --> 08:02:55,740
in going to Brighton

29777
08:02:55,740 --> 08:02:56,940
with all my family,

29778
08:02:57,200 --> 08:02:57,860
this would not

29779
08:02:57,860 --> 08:02:58,740
have happened.

29780
08:02:58,740 --> 08:02:59,700
But poor dear

29781
08:02:59,700 --> 08:03:00,740
Lydia had nobody

29782
08:03:00,740 --> 08:03:01,940
to take care of her.

29783
08:03:02,100 --> 08:03:03,060
Why did the forced

29784
08:03:03,060 --> 08:03:03,480
as ever

29785
08:03:03,480 --> 08:03:04,020
let go out

29786
08:03:04,020 --> 08:03:05,220
of their sight?

29787
08:03:05,280 --> 08:03:05,780
I am sure

29788
08:03:05,780 --> 08:03:06,200
there was some

29789
08:03:06,200 --> 08:03:07,100
great neglect

29790
08:03:07,100 --> 08:03:08,300
or other on that side,

29791
08:03:08,300 --> 08:03:09,420
for she is not the kind

29792
08:03:09,420 --> 08:03:09,720
of girl

29793
08:03:09,720 --> 08:03:10,560
to do such a thing.

29794
08:03:10,560 --> 08:03:11,060
If she had been

29795
08:03:11,060 --> 08:03:12,260
well looked after.

29796
08:03:12,540 --> 08:03:13,400
I always thought

29797
08:03:13,400 --> 08:03:14,180
they were very unfit

29798
08:03:14,180 --> 08:03:14,540
to have the

29799
08:03:14,540 --> 08:03:15,420
charge of her.

29800
08:03:15,420 --> 08:03:16,460
But I was overruled,

29801
08:03:16,460 --> 08:03:17,660
as I always am.

29802
08:03:18,120 --> 08:03:19,320
Dear child.

29803
08:03:19,340 --> 08:03:20,340
And now his Mr.

29804
08:03:20,340 --> 08:03:21,480
Bennett gone away.

29805
08:03:21,480 --> 08:03:22,140
And I know he will

29806
08:03:22,140 --> 08:03:23,040
fight Wicked

29807
08:03:23,040 --> 08:03:24,240
whenever he meets him.

29808
08:03:24,260 --> 08:03:24,740
And then he would

29809
08:03:24,740 --> 08:03:25,460
be killed.

29810
08:03:25,460 --> 08:03:26,220
I would just become

29811
08:03:26,220 --> 08:03:27,600
this all the colonies

29812
08:03:27,620 --> 08:03:28,320
will turn us out

29813
08:03:28,320 --> 08:03:28,740
before he is

29814
08:03:28,740 --> 08:03:29,940
cold in his grave.

29815
08:03:30,120 --> 08:03:30,600
And if you

29816
08:03:30,600 --> 08:03:31,280
are not kind to

29817
08:03:31,280 --> 08:03:32,060
us, brother,

29818
08:03:32,060 --> 08:03:32,700
I do not know

29819
08:03:32,700 --> 08:03:33,900
what we shall do.

29820
08:03:34,460 --> 08:03:34,920
They all.

29821
08:03:34,920 --> 08:03:35,520
Exclaimed.

29822
08:03:35,520 --> 08:03:36,260
Against such

29823
08:03:36,260 --> 08:03:37,400
terrific ideas.

29824
08:03:37,400 --> 08:03:37,860
And Mr.

29825
08:03:37,860 --> 08:03:38,360
Gardner,

29826
08:03:38,360 --> 08:03:39,540
after general assurances

29827
08:03:39,540 --> 08:03:40,620
of his affection for her

29828
08:03:40,620 --> 08:03:41,820
and all her family,

29829
08:03:41,960 --> 08:03:42,420
told her

29830
08:03:42,420 --> 08:03:43,020
that he meant to be

29831
08:03:43,020 --> 08:03:43,460
in London

29832
08:03:43,460 --> 08:03:44,660
the very next day

29833
08:03:44,720 --> 08:03:45,780
and would assist Mr.

29834
08:03:45,780 --> 08:03:46,100
Bennett

29835
08:03:46,100 --> 08:03:46,980
in every endeavor

29836
08:03:46,980 --> 08:03:48,180
for recovering Lydia.

29837
08:03:48,720 --> 08:03:49,400
Do not give way

29838
08:03:49,400 --> 08:03:51,500
to useless alarm, added

29839
08:03:51,500 --> 08:03:52,760
he though

29840
08:03:52,760 --> 08:03:53,220
it is right

29841
08:03:53,220 --> 08:03:53,840
to be prepared

29842
08:03:53,840 --> 08:03:54,680
for the worst.

29843
08:03:54,680 --> 08:03:55,640
There is no occasion

29844
08:03:55,640 --> 08:03:56,240
to look on it.

29845
08:03:56,240 --> 08:03:57,420
A certain

29846
08:03:57,420 --> 08:03:58,560
It is not quite a week

29847
08:03:58,560 --> 08:03:59,000
since they

29848
08:03:59,000 --> 08:04:00,200
left Brighton.

29849
08:04:00,360 --> 08:04:01,460
In a few days more

29850
08:04:01,460 --> 08:04:02,040
we may gain

29851
08:04:02,040 --> 08:04:03,180
some news of them

29852
08:04:03,180 --> 08:04:04,020
until we know

29853
08:04:04,020 --> 08:04:04,560
that they are

29854
08:04:04,560 --> 08:04:05,180
not married

29855
08:04:05,180 --> 08:04:06,360
and have no design

29856
08:04:06,360 --> 08:04:07,220
of marrying.

29857
08:04:07,220 --> 08:04:08,220
Do not let us give

29858
08:04:08,220 --> 08:04:09,660
the matter over as lost.

29859
08:04:10,220 --> 08:04:11,000
As soon as I get

29860
08:04:11,000 --> 08:04:11,640
to town.

29861
08:04:11,640 --> 08:04:12,840
I shall go to my brother

29862
08:04:12,900 --> 08:04:13,920
and make him come home

29863
08:04:13,920 --> 08:04:14,660
with me to Grace

29864
08:04:14,660 --> 08:04:15,660
Church Street.

29865
08:04:15,660 --> 08:04:16,320
And then we may

29866
08:04:16,320 --> 08:04:17,220
consult together

29867
08:04:17,220 --> 08:04:17,820
as to what is

29868
08:04:17,820 --> 08:04:18,360
to be done.

29869
08:04:19,400 --> 08:04:20,660
Oh, my

29870
08:04:20,660 --> 08:04:22,040
dear brother,

29871
08:04:22,440 --> 08:04:23,220
replied Mrs.

29872
08:04:23,220 --> 08:04:23,960
Bennett.

29873
08:04:23,960 --> 08:04:25,020
That is exactly

29874
08:04:25,020 --> 08:04:25,440
what I could

29875
08:04:25,440 --> 08:04:26,640
most wish for.

29876
08:04:27,240 --> 08:04:27,800
Now, do you,

29877
08:04:27,800 --> 08:04:28,160
when you shall

29878
08:04:28,160 --> 08:04:28,860
get to town,

29879
08:04:28,860 --> 08:04:29,660
find them out

29880
08:04:29,660 --> 08:04:30,860
wherever they may be.

29881
08:04:30,860 --> 08:04:31,400
And if they are

29882
08:04:31,400 --> 08:04:32,600
not married already,

29883
08:04:32,660 --> 08:04:33,860
make them marry

29884
08:04:34,080 --> 08:04:34,700
and ask for

29885
08:04:34,700 --> 08:04:35,540
wedding clothes.

29886
08:04:35,540 --> 08:04:36,440
Do not let them

29887
08:04:36,440 --> 08:04:37,160
wait that.

29888
08:04:37,160 --> 08:04:38,100
But tell Lydia

29889
08:04:38,100 --> 08:04:38,520
she shall have

29890
08:04:38,520 --> 08:04:39,140
as much money

29891
08:04:39,140 --> 08:04:39,800
as she chooses

29892
08:04:39,800 --> 08:04:40,340
to buy them

29893
08:04:40,340 --> 08:04:41,540
after they married.

29894
08:04:41,780 --> 08:04:43,500
And above all, keep Mr.

29895
08:04:43,500 --> 08:04:44,700
Bennett from fighting.

29896
08:04:44,900 --> 08:04:45,440
Tell him what

29897
08:04:45,440 --> 08:04:46,400
a dreadful state

29898
08:04:46,400 --> 08:04:47,180
I am in that

29899
08:04:47,180 --> 08:04:47,820
I am frightened

29900
08:04:47,820 --> 08:04:48,720
out of my wits

29901
08:04:48,720 --> 08:04:50,060
and have such trembling,

29902
08:04:50,060 --> 08:04:51,440
such fluttering all over

29903
08:04:51,440 --> 08:04:52,800
me, such spasms

29904
08:04:52,800 --> 08:04:53,400
in my side

29905
08:04:53,400 --> 08:04:54,420
and pains in my head

29906
08:04:54,420 --> 08:04:55,260
and such beatings

29907
08:04:55,260 --> 08:04:55,820
at heart

29908
08:04:55,820 --> 08:04:56,840
that I can get no rest

29909
08:04:56,840 --> 08:04:58,040
by night or day.

29910
08:04:58,220 --> 08:04:59,700
And tell my dear Lydia

29911
08:04:59,720 --> 08:05:00,380
not to give

29912
08:05:00,380 --> 08:05:01,080
any directions

29913
08:05:01,080 --> 08:05:01,820
about her clothes

29914
08:05:01,820 --> 08:05:03,000
till she has seen me,

29915
08:05:03,000 --> 08:05:03,260
because she

29916
08:05:03,260 --> 08:05:03,920
does not know

29917
08:05:03,920 --> 08:05:04,200
which are the

29918
08:05:04,200 --> 08:05:05,400
best warehouses.

29919
08:05:05,720 --> 08:05:06,800
So rather

29920
08:05:06,800 --> 08:05:08,000
how kind you are.

29921
08:05:08,180 --> 08:05:09,140
I know you will contrive

29922
08:05:09,140 --> 08:05:09,740
it all.

29923
08:05:09,740 --> 08:05:10,280
But Mr.

29924
08:05:10,280 --> 08:05:11,040
Gardiner, though

29925
08:05:11,040 --> 08:05:11,960
he assured her again

29926
08:05:11,960 --> 08:05:13,100
of his earnest endeavors

29927
08:05:13,100 --> 08:05:13,880
in the cause.

29928
08:05:13,880 --> 08:05:14,600
Could not avoid.

29929
08:05:14,600 --> 08:05:15,840
Recommending moderation

29930
08:05:15,960 --> 08:05:16,860
her as well

29931
08:05:16,860 --> 08:05:17,540
in her hopes

29932
08:05:17,540 --> 08:05:18,480
as her fear.

29933
08:05:18,480 --> 08:05:18,980
And after

29934
08:05:18,980 --> 08:05:19,620
talking with her

29935
08:05:19,620 --> 08:05:20,220
in this manner

29936
08:05:20,220 --> 08:05:20,660
till dinner

29937
08:05:20,660 --> 08:05:21,660
was on the table,

29938
08:05:21,660 --> 08:05:22,460
they all left her

29939
08:05:22,460 --> 08:05:22,860
to vent

29940
08:05:22,860 --> 08:05:23,580
all her feelings

29941
08:05:23,580 --> 08:05:24,660
on the housekeeper

29942
08:05:24,660 --> 08:05:25,340
who attended.

29943
08:05:25,340 --> 08:05:26,100
In the absence.

29944
08:05:26,100 --> 08:05:27,300
Her daughters,

29945
08:05:27,380 --> 08:05:28,200
though her brother

29946
08:05:28,200 --> 08:05:28,740
and sister,

29947
08:05:28,740 --> 08:05:29,340
were persuaded

29948
08:05:29,340 --> 08:05:29,760
that there was

29949
08:05:29,760 --> 08:05:30,560
no real occasion

29950
08:05:30,560 --> 08:05:31,460
for such a seclusion

29951
08:05:31,460 --> 08:05:32,480
from the family.

29952
08:05:32,480 --> 08:05:33,300
They did not attempt

29953
08:05:33,300 --> 08:05:34,460
to oppose it, for.

29954
08:05:34,460 --> 08:05:34,920
They knew that

29955
08:05:34,920 --> 08:05:36,080
she had not prudence

29956
08:05:36,080 --> 08:05:36,800
to hold her tongue

29957
08:05:36,800 --> 08:05:37,880
before the servants,

29958
08:05:37,880 --> 08:05:38,520
while they waited.

29959
08:05:38,520 --> 08:05:39,960
At the table and judged.

29960
08:05:39,960 --> 08:05:41,120
It better that one

29961
08:05:41,120 --> 08:05:42,320
only of the household

29962
08:05:42,360 --> 08:05:43,200
and the one whom

29963
08:05:43,200 --> 08:05:44,400
they could most trust

29964
08:05:44,420 --> 08:05:45,240
should comprehend

29965
08:05:45,240 --> 08:05:46,020
all her fears

29966
08:05:46,020 --> 08:05:46,760
and solicitude

29967
08:05:46,760 --> 08:05:47,960
on the subject.

29968
08:05:48,200 --> 08:05:49,040
In the dining room,

29969
08:05:49,040 --> 08:05:49,520
they were soon

29970
08:05:49,520 --> 08:05:50,040
joined by

29971
08:05:50,040 --> 08:05:51,120
Mary and Kitty,

29972
08:05:51,120 --> 08:05:52,100
who had been too busily

29973
08:05:52,100 --> 08:05:52,580
engaged

29974
08:05:52,580 --> 08:05:52,820
in their

29975
08:05:52,820 --> 08:05:53,660
separate apartments

29976
08:05:53,660 --> 08:05:54,120
to make their

29977
08:05:54,120 --> 08:05:55,320
appearance before

29978
08:05:55,640 --> 08:05:56,900
one came from her books

29979
08:05:57,120 --> 08:05:57,780
and the other

29980
08:05:57,780 --> 08:05:58,980
from her toilette.

29981
08:05:59,100 --> 08:06:00,060
The faces of both,

29982
08:06:00,060 --> 08:06:00,380
however,

29983
08:06:00,380 --> 08:06:01,580
were tolerably calm.

29984
08:06:01,680 --> 08:06:02,100
And no.

29985
08:06:02,100 --> 08:06:03,120
Change was visible

29986
08:06:03,120 --> 08:06:03,960
in either,

29987
08:06:03,960 --> 08:06:05,160
except that the loss,

29988
08:06:05,180 --> 08:06:06,380
her favorite sister

29989
08:06:06,420 --> 08:06:07,160
or the anger

29990
08:06:07,160 --> 08:06:08,060
which she had herself

29991
08:06:08,060 --> 08:06:08,580
incurred in

29992
08:06:08,580 --> 08:06:09,380
this business.

29993
08:06:09,380 --> 08:06:09,620
Had.

29994
08:06:09,620 --> 08:06:09,900
Given

29995
08:06:09,900 --> 08:06:10,820
more of fruitfulness

29996
08:06:10,820 --> 08:06:11,400
than usual

29997
08:06:11,400 --> 08:06:12,660
to the accents of Kitty.

29998
08:06:13,200 --> 08:06:14,540
As for Mary, she.

29999
08:06:14,540 --> 08:06:15,360
Was mistress.

30000
08:06:15,360 --> 08:06:16,320
Of herself to whisper

30001
08:06:16,320 --> 08:06:17,120
to Elizabeth

30002
08:06:17,120 --> 08:06:17,940
with a countenance

30003
08:06:17,940 --> 08:06:19,040
of grave reflection.

30004
08:06:19,040 --> 08:06:19,460
Soon after,

30005
08:06:19,460 --> 08:06:19,940
they were seated

30006
08:06:19,940 --> 08:06:21,140
at the table.

30007
08:06:21,380 --> 08:06:22,320
This is a most

30008
08:06:22,320 --> 08:06:23,520
unfortunate affair

30009
08:06:23,660 --> 08:06:24,660
and will probably be

30010
08:06:24,660 --> 08:06:25,860
much of.

30011
08:06:25,940 --> 08:06:27,200
But we must stem

30012
08:06:27,200 --> 08:06:28,400
the tide of malice

30013
08:06:28,500 --> 08:06:29,060
and pour

30014
08:06:29,060 --> 08:06:30,260
into the wounded bosoms

30015
08:06:30,260 --> 08:06:30,740
of each other.

30016
08:06:30,740 --> 08:06:31,820
The bottom of sisterly

30017
08:06:31,820 --> 08:06:33,020
consolation.

30018
08:06:33,600 --> 08:06:34,460
Then, perceiving

30019
08:06:34,460 --> 08:06:34,920
Elizabeth

30020
08:06:34,920 --> 08:06:35,660
had no intention

30021
08:06:35,660 --> 08:06:37,140
of replying, she added.

30022
08:06:37,740 --> 08:06:39,000
Unhappy as the event

30023
08:06:39,000 --> 08:06:40,200
must be for Lydia.

30024
08:06:40,260 --> 08:06:41,240
We may draw from it

30025
08:06:41,240 --> 08:06:42,440
this useful lesson

30026
08:06:42,540 --> 08:06:43,320
that loss of.

30027
08:06:43,320 --> 08:06:44,040
Virtue in a.

30028
08:06:44,040 --> 08:06:45,680
Female irretrievable.

30029
08:06:46,020 --> 08:06:47,100
That one false

30030
08:06:47,100 --> 08:06:48,300
step involves

30031
08:06:48,340 --> 08:06:49,540
an endless ruin.

30032
08:06:49,700 --> 08:06:50,660
That reputation

30033
08:06:50,660 --> 08:06:51,840
is no less brittle

30034
08:06:51,840 --> 08:06:53,040
than it is beautiful,

30035
08:06:53,160 --> 08:06:54,120
and that she cannot

30036
08:06:54,120 --> 08:06:55,460
be too guarded in her

30037
08:06:55,460 --> 08:06:56,700
behavior towards the.

30038
08:06:56,700 --> 08:06:57,500
Undeserving of

30039
08:06:57,500 --> 08:06:58,280
the other sex.

30040
08:06:59,360 --> 08:07:00,360
Elizabeth lifted up

30041
08:07:00,360 --> 08:07:01,560
her eyes in amazement,

30042
08:07:01,680 --> 08:07:02,280
but was too

30043
08:07:02,280 --> 08:07:03,060
much oppressed

30044
08:07:03,060 --> 08:07:04,260
to make any reply.

30045
08:07:04,740 --> 08:07:05,480
Mary, however,

30046
08:07:05,480 --> 08:07:05,960
continued to

30047
08:07:05,960 --> 08:07:06,740
console herself

30048
08:07:06,740 --> 08:07:07,400
with such kind

30049
08:07:07,400 --> 08:07:08,460
of moral extractions

30050
08:07:08,460 --> 08:07:09,060
from the evil

30051
08:07:09,060 --> 08:07:10,100
before them.

30052
08:07:10,100 --> 08:07:11,240
In the afternoon,

30053
08:07:11,240 --> 08:07:11,960
the two elder

30054
08:07:11,960 --> 08:07:12,560
Miss Bennetts

30055
08:07:12,560 --> 08:07:13,280
were able to be

30056
08:07:13,280 --> 08:07:14,160
for a half hour

30057
08:07:14,160 --> 08:07:15,020
themselves,

30058
08:07:15,020 --> 08:07:16,220
and Elizabeth instantly

30059
08:07:16,220 --> 08:07:16,940
availed herself

30060
08:07:16,940 --> 08:07:17,820
of the opportunity

30061
08:07:17,820 --> 08:07:19,020
of making any inquiries.

30062
08:07:19,100 --> 08:07:19,760
Which Jane.

30063
08:07:19,760 --> 08:07:20,600
Was equally eager

30064
08:07:20,600 --> 08:07:21,780
to satisfy.

30065
08:07:21,780 --> 08:07:22,520
After joining

30066
08:07:22,520 --> 08:07:22,940
in general,

30067
08:07:22,940 --> 08:07:23,880
Lamentations over,

30068
08:07:23,880 --> 08:07:24,320
the dreadful

30069
08:07:24,320 --> 08:07:25,520
sequel of this event,

30070
08:07:25,580 --> 08:07:26,280
which Elizabeth

30071
08:07:26,280 --> 08:07:27,060
considered as all

30072
08:07:27,060 --> 08:07:28,380
but certain and Mr.

30073
08:07:28,380 --> 08:07:29,280
Bennett could not assert

30074
08:07:29,280 --> 08:07:30,480
to be wholly impossible.

30075
08:07:30,840 --> 08:07:31,340
The former

30076
08:07:31,340 --> 08:07:32,300
continued the subject

30077
08:07:32,300 --> 08:07:33,500
by saying,

30078
08:07:33,600 --> 08:07:34,860
But Tell me all

30079
08:07:34,860 --> 08:07:35,900
and everything about it,

30080
08:07:35,900 --> 08:07:36,140
which I.

30081
08:07:36,140 --> 08:07:37,340
Have not already heard.

30082
08:07:37,520 --> 08:07:38,160
Give me further

30083
08:07:38,160 --> 08:07:39,260
particulars.

30084
08:07:39,260 --> 08:07:40,080
Watched it, Colonel.

30085
08:07:40,080 --> 08:07:41,180
Forced to say

30086
08:07:41,180 --> 08:07:41,720
How do they knew

30087
08:07:41,720 --> 08:07:42,680
apprehension of anything

30088
08:07:42,680 --> 08:07:43,380
before the elopement

30089
08:07:43,380 --> 08:07:44,480
took place?

30090
08:07:44,480 --> 08:07:45,320
They must have seen

30091
08:07:45,320 --> 08:07:46,520
them together forever,

30092
08:07:47,240 --> 08:07:48,120
kind of forced to do it.

30093
08:07:48,120 --> 08:07:48,680
And that he has

30094
08:07:48,680 --> 08:07:49,520
often suspected

30095
08:07:49,520 --> 08:07:50,700
some partiality,

30096
08:07:50,700 --> 08:07:51,440
especially on

30097
08:07:51,440 --> 08:07:52,580
Lydia's side.

30098
08:07:52,580 --> 08:07:53,420
But nothing to

30099
08:07:53,420 --> 08:07:53,840
give him any.

30100
08:07:54,900 --> 08:07:55,380
I am so

30101
08:07:55,380 --> 08:07:56,580
grieved for him.

30102
08:07:56,780 --> 08:07:57,500
His behavior

30103
08:07:57,500 --> 08:07:58,260
was attentive

30104
08:07:58,260 --> 08:07:59,700
and kind to the utmost.

30105
08:08:00,120 --> 08:08:01,500
He was coming to us

30106
08:08:01,500 --> 08:08:01,880
in order

30107
08:08:01,880 --> 08:08:02,360
to assure us

30108
08:08:02,360 --> 08:08:03,440
of his concern

30109
08:08:03,440 --> 08:08:03,980
before he had

30110
08:08:03,980 --> 08:08:04,740
any idea of

30111
08:08:04,740 --> 08:08:05,460
then not being gone

30112
08:08:05,460 --> 08:08:06,540
to Scotland.

30113
08:08:06,540 --> 08:08:07,460
When that apprehension

30114
08:08:07,460 --> 08:08:08,480
first got abroad.

30115
08:08:08,480 --> 08:08:09,780
It hastened his journey

30116
08:08:10,760 --> 08:08:12,120
and was deeply convinced

30117
08:08:12,120 --> 08:08:12,540
that Wickham

30118
08:08:12,540 --> 08:08:13,560
would not marry.

30119
08:08:13,560 --> 08:08:14,240
Did he know of there

30120
08:08:14,240 --> 08:08:15,360
intending to go off?

30121
08:08:15,360 --> 08:08:16,220
Had Colonel forced

30122
08:08:16,220 --> 08:08:17,420
to send any himself?

30123
08:08:18,060 --> 08:08:18,840
Yes.

30124
08:08:18,840 --> 08:08:19,220
But when

30125
08:08:19,220 --> 08:08:20,420
questioned by him,

30126
08:08:20,460 --> 08:08:21,140
Danny denied.

30127
08:08:21,140 --> 08:08:21,840
Knowing anything

30128
08:08:21,840 --> 08:08:22,040
of their.

30129
08:08:22,040 --> 08:08:22,740
Plans

30130
08:08:22,740 --> 08:08:23,780
and not give his real

30131
08:08:23,780 --> 08:08:24,980
opinion about it.

30132
08:08:25,020 --> 08:08:25,740
He did not repeat

30133
08:08:25,740 --> 08:08:26,300
his persuasion

30134
08:08:26,300 --> 08:08:27,500
of their not marrying.

30135
08:08:27,620 --> 08:08:28,440
And from that

30136
08:08:28,440 --> 08:08:29,100
I am inclined to.

30137
08:08:29,100 --> 08:08:29,580
Hope

30138
08:08:29,580 --> 08:08:30,020
he might have

30139
08:08:30,020 --> 08:08:30,740
been misunderstood

30140
08:08:30,740 --> 08:08:31,940
before

30141
08:08:31,980 --> 08:08:32,940
and till Colonel

30142
08:08:32,940 --> 08:08:34,140
Foster came himself.

30143
08:08:34,260 --> 08:08:34,920
Not one of you

30144
08:08:34,920 --> 08:08:35,820
entertained a doubt, I.

30145
08:08:35,820 --> 08:08:36,500
Suppose, of that.

30146
08:08:36,500 --> 08:08:37,700
Being really married.

30147
08:08:37,940 --> 08:08:39,060
How is it possible

30148
08:08:39,060 --> 08:08:39,920
that such an idea

30149
08:08:39,920 --> 08:08:41,120
should enter our brains?

30150
08:08:41,600 --> 08:08:42,860
I felt a little uneasy,

30151
08:08:43,200 --> 08:08:44,100
a little fearful of.

30152
08:08:44,100 --> 08:08:45,140
My sister's happiness.

30153
08:08:45,140 --> 08:08:46,160
With him in marriage,

30154
08:08:46,160 --> 08:08:46,740
because I know

30155
08:08:46,740 --> 08:08:47,480
that his conduct

30156
08:08:47,480 --> 08:08:48,440
had not been always

30157
08:08:48,440 --> 08:08:49,640
quite right.

30158
08:08:49,680 --> 08:08:50,300
My father

30159
08:08:50,300 --> 08:08:50,840
and mother knew

30160
08:08:50,840 --> 08:08:51,860
nothing of that.

30161
08:08:51,860 --> 08:08:52,800
They only felt

30162
08:08:52,800 --> 08:08:53,760
imprudent to match.

30163
08:08:53,760 --> 08:08:54,960
It must be.

30164
08:08:55,080 --> 08:08:56,060
Kitty, then owned

30165
08:08:56,060 --> 08:08:56,220
with a

30166
08:08:56,220 --> 08:08:57,460
very natural triumph

30167
08:08:57,480 --> 08:08:58,100
on knowing more

30168
08:08:58,100 --> 08:08:59,060
than the rest of us

30169
08:08:59,060 --> 08:08:59,720
that in Lydia's

30170
08:08:59,720 --> 08:09:00,720
last letter, she had.

30171
08:09:00,720 --> 08:09:01,560
Prepared for such a.

30172
08:09:01,560 --> 08:09:02,360
Step.

30173
08:09:02,360 --> 08:09:03,180
She had known, it.

30174
08:09:03,180 --> 08:09:03,780
Seems, of their

30175
08:09:03,780 --> 08:09:04,460
being in love with

30176
08:09:04,460 --> 08:09:05,520
each other many. Weeks,

30177
08:09:06,480 --> 08:09:07,280
but not before they

30178
08:09:07,280 --> 08:09:08,480
went to Brighton.

30179
08:09:08,840 --> 08:09:10,220
No, I believe not.

30180
08:09:11,040 --> 08:09:11,840
And did Colonel

30181
08:09:11,840 --> 08:09:12,560
Faust prepared

30182
08:09:12,560 --> 08:09:12,980
think Well,

30183
08:09:12,980 --> 08:09:14,100
if we can himself.

30184
08:09:14,100 --> 08:09:14,640
Does he know

30185
08:09:14,640 --> 08:09:15,840
his real character?

30186
08:09:16,380 --> 08:09:17,280
I must confess

30187
08:09:17,280 --> 08:09:17,600
that he did

30188
08:09:17,600 --> 08:09:18,240
not speak so

30189
08:09:18,240 --> 08:09:18,800
well of Wickham

30190
08:09:18,800 --> 08:09:20,000
as he formally did.

30191
08:09:20,120 --> 08:09:20,760
He believed him

30192
08:09:20,760 --> 08:09:21,660
to be imprudent

30193
08:09:21,660 --> 08:09:22,860
and extravagant.

30194
08:09:23,060 --> 08:09:23,580
And since.

30195
08:09:23,580 --> 08:09:24,120
This sad

30196
08:09:24,120 --> 08:09:24,860
affair has taken.

30197
08:09:24,860 --> 08:09:25,440
Place,

30198
08:09:25,440 --> 08:09:26,580
it is said that he left.

30199
08:09:26,580 --> 08:09:27,860
Meriton greatly in debt.

30200
08:09:28,340 --> 08:09:28,820
But I hope

30201
08:09:28,820 --> 08:09:30,020
this may be false.

30202
08:09:30,540 --> 08:09:30,900
How?

30203
08:09:30,900 --> 08:09:32,360
Jane, had we been

30204
08:09:32,360 --> 08:09:33,560
less secret.

30205
08:09:33,600 --> 08:09:34,560
Had we told what we

30206
08:09:34,560 --> 08:09:35,080
knew of him,

30207
08:09:35,080 --> 08:09:35,700
this could not

30208
08:09:35,700 --> 08:09:36,900
have happened.

30209
08:09:37,320 --> 08:09:38,000
Perhaps it would

30210
08:09:38,000 --> 08:09:39,060
have been better.

30211
08:09:39,060 --> 08:09:40,260
Replied her sister.

30212
08:09:40,520 --> 08:09:41,900
But to expose the former

30213
08:09:41,900 --> 08:09:42,300
faults

30214
08:09:42,300 --> 08:09:43,260
of any person without.

30215
08:09:43,260 --> 08:09:43,620
Knowing what

30216
08:09:43,620 --> 08:09:44,160
that present

30217
08:09:44,160 --> 08:09:44,720
feelings were.

30218
08:09:44,720 --> 08:09:46,020
Seemed unjustifiable.

30219
08:09:46,440 --> 08:09:47,120
We acted with

30220
08:09:47,120 --> 08:09:48,360
the best intentions.

30221
08:09:49,260 --> 08:09:49,940
Could Colonel

30222
08:09:49,940 --> 08:09:50,600
forced to repeat

30223
08:09:50,600 --> 08:09:51,240
the particulars

30224
08:09:51,240 --> 08:09:52,560
of Lydia's to his wife?

30225
08:09:53,280 --> 08:09:54,200
He brought it with him

30226
08:09:54,200 --> 08:09:55,400
for us to see.

30227
08:09:55,820 --> 08:09:56,420
Jane then

30228
08:09:56,420 --> 08:09:56,840
took it from

30229
08:09:56,840 --> 08:09:57,740
her pocketbook

30230
08:09:57,740 --> 08:09:58,940
and gave it to Lydia.

30231
08:09:59,360 --> 08:10:00,560
These were the contents

30232
08:10:01,220 --> 08:10:02,720
of my dearest Harriet.

30233
08:10:03,060 --> 08:10:03,840
You will laugh

30234
08:10:03,840 --> 08:10:04,460
and you know where I am

30235
08:10:04,460 --> 08:10:04,920
gone.

30236
08:10:04,920 --> 08:10:05,940
And I cannot help

30237
08:10:05,940 --> 08:10:06,860
laughing myself

30238
08:10:06,860 --> 08:10:07,520
at your surprise.

30239
08:10:07,520 --> 08:10:08,280
Tomorrow morning,

30240
08:10:08,280 --> 08:10:09,480
as soon as I am missed,

30241
08:10:09,680 --> 08:10:10,500
I am going to

30242
08:10:10,500 --> 08:10:11,520
Gretna green.

30243
08:10:11,520 --> 08:10:12,600
And if you cannot guess

30244
08:10:12,600 --> 08:10:13,160
with who

30245
08:10:13,160 --> 08:10:13,800
I shall think

30246
08:10:13,800 --> 08:10:14,720
you a simpleton.

30247
08:10:14,720 --> 08:10:15,140
But there is

30248
08:10:15,140 --> 08:10:15,840
but one man

30249
08:10:15,840 --> 08:10:16,680
in the world I love.

30250
08:10:16,680 --> 08:10:18,080
And he is an angel.

30251
08:10:18,320 --> 08:10:19,380
I should never be happy

30252
08:10:19,380 --> 08:10:20,160
without him.

30253
08:10:20,160 --> 08:10:20,720
So think it's

30254
08:10:20,720 --> 08:10:21,920
no harm to be off.

30255
08:10:22,100 --> 08:10:22,500
You need

30256
08:10:22,500 --> 08:10:23,120
to send the word

30257
08:10:23,120 --> 08:10:24,000
long one to by going.

30258
08:10:24,000 --> 08:10:25,080
If you do not like it

30259
08:10:25,080 --> 08:10:25,220
here,

30260
08:10:25,220 --> 08:10:25,620
it will make

30261
08:10:25,620 --> 08:10:26,180
the surprise

30262
08:10:26,180 --> 08:10:26,880
the greater.

30263
08:10:26,880 --> 08:10:27,680
When I write to them

30264
08:10:27,680 --> 08:10:28,520
and sign my name.

30265
08:10:28,520 --> 08:10:29,720
Lydia Wickham.

30266
08:10:29,880 --> 08:10:30,620
What a good joke

30267
08:10:30,620 --> 08:10:31,260
will be.

30268
08:10:31,260 --> 08:10:32,340
I can hardly write

30269
08:10:32,340 --> 08:10:33,860
for laughing, pray,

30270
08:10:33,860 --> 08:10:35,220
make my excuses to Pratt

30271
08:10:35,220 --> 08:10:35,820
for not keeping

30272
08:10:35,820 --> 08:10:36,500
my engagement

30273
08:10:36,500 --> 08:10:37,220
and dancing

30274
08:10:37,220 --> 08:10:38,220
with him tonight.

30275
08:10:38,220 --> 08:10:39,120
Tell him I hope he will

30276
08:10:39,120 --> 08:10:39,740
excuse me. What?

30277
08:10:39,740 --> 08:10:40,520
He knows all.

30278
08:10:40,520 --> 08:10:41,180
And tell him

30279
08:10:41,180 --> 08:10:42,140
I will dance with him.

30280
08:10:42,140 --> 08:10:42,780
At the next ball

30281
08:10:42,780 --> 08:10:43,320
We meet with

30282
08:10:43,320 --> 08:10:44,520
great pleasure.

30283
08:10:44,540 --> 08:10:45,060
I shall send

30284
08:10:45,060 --> 08:10:45,560
for my clothes

30285
08:10:45,560 --> 08:10:46,200
when I get along.

30286
08:10:46,200 --> 08:10:46,800
Born.

30287
08:10:46,800 --> 08:10:47,180
But I wish

30288
08:10:47,180 --> 08:10:47,540
you would tell

30289
08:10:47,540 --> 08:10:48,120
Sally to mend

30290
08:10:48,120 --> 08:10:48,740
a great slit

30291
08:10:48,740 --> 08:10:49,940
in my worked bosom gown.

30292
08:10:50,220 --> 08:10:51,300
They are packed up.

30293
08:10:51,300 --> 08:10:52,100
Goodbye.

30294
08:10:52,100 --> 08:10:52,680
Give my love

30295
08:10:52,680 --> 08:10:53,640
to Kyle Foster.

30296
08:10:53,640 --> 08:10:54,500
I hope you will drink

30297
08:10:54,500 --> 08:10:55,700
to our good Ajani,

30298
08:10:55,820 --> 08:10:56,480
your affectionate

30299
08:10:56,480 --> 08:10:57,000
friend.

30300
08:10:57,000 --> 08:10:58,200
Lydia Bennet.

30301
08:10:58,280 --> 08:10:59,720
Oh, thoughtless

30302
08:11:00,080 --> 08:11:00,780
thoughtless.

30303
08:11:00,780 --> 08:11:01,760
Lydia.

30304
08:11:01,760 --> 08:11:02,580
Cried Elizabeth

30305
08:11:02,580 --> 08:11:02,840
when she

30306
08:11:02,840 --> 08:11:04,040
had finished it.

30307
08:11:04,080 --> 08:11:04,940
What a letter

30308
08:11:04,940 --> 08:11:05,460
is this

30309
08:11:05,460 --> 08:11:06,060
to be written

30310
08:11:06,060 --> 08:11:07,260
at such a moment.

30311
08:11:07,940 --> 08:11:08,460
But at least

30312
08:11:08,460 --> 08:11:08,960
it shows that.

30313
08:11:08,960 --> 08:11:10,020
She was serious on

30314
08:11:10,020 --> 08:11:10,460
the subject

30315
08:11:10,460 --> 08:11:11,460
of that journey.

30316
08:11:11,460 --> 08:11:12,320
Whatever he might

30317
08:11:12,320 --> 08:11:12,840
afterwards

30318
08:11:12,840 --> 08:11:14,000
persuade her to.

30319
08:11:14,000 --> 08:11:15,420
It was not on her side.

30320
08:11:15,420 --> 08:11:16,620
A scheme of infamy.

30321
08:11:17,220 --> 08:11:18,420
My poor father.

30322
08:11:18,560 --> 08:11:19,220
How he must

30323
08:11:19,220 --> 08:11:20,420
have felt it.

30324
08:11:20,900 --> 08:11:21,780
I never saw anyone

30325
08:11:21,780 --> 08:11:22,680
so shocked.

30326
08:11:22,680 --> 08:11:23,420
He could not speak

30327
08:11:23,420 --> 08:11:24,120
a word for full

30328
08:11:24,120 --> 08:11:25,160
10 minutes.

30329
08:11:25,160 --> 08:11:26,000
My mother was taken

30330
08:11:26,000 --> 08:11:27,020
ill immediately

30331
08:11:27,020 --> 08:11:27,920
and the whole house,

30332
08:11:27,920 --> 08:11:29,160
in such confusion.

30333
08:11:29,880 --> 08:11:31,040
Oh, Jane.

30334
08:11:31,040 --> 08:11:32,240
Cried Elizabeth.

30335
08:11:32,340 --> 08:11:33,240
Was there a servant

30336
08:11:33,240 --> 08:11:33,960
belonging to it

30337
08:11:33,960 --> 08:11:34,580
to do not to know

30338
08:11:34,580 --> 08:11:35,280
the whole story

30339
08:11:35,280 --> 08:11:35,520
before

30340
08:11:35,520 --> 08:11:36,720
the end of the day?

30341
08:11:37,140 --> 08:11:38,340
I do not know.

30342
08:11:38,420 --> 08:11:39,620
I hope there was.

30343
08:11:39,900 --> 08:11:40,760
But to be guarded

30344
08:11:40,760 --> 08:11:41,160
at such a

30345
08:11:41,160 --> 08:11:42,360
time is very difficult.

30346
08:11:42,680 --> 08:11:43,320
My mother was

30347
08:11:43,320 --> 08:11:44,340
in hysterics,

30348
08:11:44,340 --> 08:11:45,380
and though I endeavored

30349
08:11:45,380 --> 08:11:45,740
to give her

30350
08:11:45,740 --> 08:11:46,500
every assistance

30351
08:11:46,500 --> 08:11:47,640
in my power,

30352
08:11:47,640 --> 08:11:48,840
I'm afraid I did not

30353
08:11:48,900 --> 08:11:49,460
so much as I

30354
08:11:49,460 --> 08:11:50,660
might have done.

30355
08:11:50,660 --> 08:11:51,260
But the horror

30356
08:11:51,260 --> 08:11:51,560
of what

30357
08:11:51,560 --> 08:11:52,520
might possibly happen

30358
08:11:52,520 --> 08:11:53,360
almost took from me

30359
08:11:53,360 --> 08:11:54,560
my faculties.

30360
08:11:54,680 --> 08:11:55,860
Your attendance upon her

30361
08:11:55,860 --> 08:11:56,460
has been too

30362
08:11:56,460 --> 08:11:57,380
much for you.

30363
08:11:57,380 --> 08:11:58,580
You do not look well.

30364
08:11:58,860 --> 08:11:59,480
Oh, that I had

30365
08:11:59,480 --> 08:12:00,540
been with you.

30366
08:12:00,540 --> 08:12:01,640
You have had every care

30367
08:12:01,640 --> 08:12:02,340
and anxiety

30368
08:12:02,340 --> 08:12:03,540
upon yourself alone.

30369
08:12:04,320 --> 08:12:05,040
Mary and Katie

30370
08:12:05,040 --> 08:12:06,180
have been very kind

30371
08:12:06,180 --> 08:12:06,920
and would have shat

30372
08:12:06,920 --> 08:12:07,700
in every fatigue.

30373
08:12:07,700 --> 08:12:08,660
I am sure.

30374
08:12:08,660 --> 08:12:09,480
But I did not think it

30375
08:12:09,480 --> 08:12:09,900
right for.

30376
08:12:09,900 --> 08:12:10,940
Either of them.

30377
08:12:10,940 --> 08:12:11,820
Katie is slight

30378
08:12:11,820 --> 08:12:12,840
and delicate,

30379
08:12:12,840 --> 08:12:13,720
and Mary studies

30380
08:12:13,720 --> 08:12:14,340
so much.

30381
08:12:14,340 --> 08:12:15,320
The 2 hours of repose

30382
08:12:15,320 --> 08:12:15,680
should not to

30383
08:12:15,680 --> 08:12:16,880
be broken in on.

30384
08:12:16,920 --> 08:12:17,760
My Aunt Philips

30385
08:12:17,760 --> 08:12:18,300
came too long.

30386
08:12:18,300 --> 08:12:19,140
Born on Tuesday

30387
08:12:19,140 --> 08:12:19,740
after my father

30388
08:12:19,740 --> 08:12:20,520
went away

30389
08:12:20,520 --> 08:12:21,200
and was so good

30390
08:12:21,200 --> 08:12:21,780
as to stay till.

30391
08:12:21,780 --> 08:12:22,760
Thursday with me.

30392
08:12:22,760 --> 08:12:23,540
She was of great.

30393
08:12:23,540 --> 08:12:24,360
Use and comfort

30394
08:12:24,360 --> 08:12:25,340
to us all.

30395
08:12:25,340 --> 08:12:25,860
And Lady

30396
08:12:25,860 --> 08:12:26,480
Lucas has been

30397
08:12:26,480 --> 08:12:27,420
very kind.

30398
08:12:27,420 --> 08:12:28,160
She walked here

30399
08:12:28,160 --> 08:12:28,640
on Wednesday

30400
08:12:28,640 --> 08:12:29,840
morning to cando with us

30401
08:12:29,940 --> 08:12:31,140
and offered her services

30402
08:12:31,320 --> 08:12:32,520
or any of her daughters

30403
08:12:32,540 --> 08:12:33,080
if they should be

30404
08:12:33,080 --> 08:12:34,280
of any use to us.

30405
08:12:34,800 --> 08:12:35,480
She had better.

30406
08:12:35,480 --> 08:12:36,680
Have stayed at home,

30407
08:12:36,680 --> 08:12:37,820
cried Elizabeth.

30408
08:12:37,820 --> 08:12:38,400
Perhaps she.

30409
08:12:38,400 --> 08:12:38,760
Meant.

30410
08:12:38,760 --> 08:12:39,260
Well,

30411
08:12:39,260 --> 08:12:39,660
but under

30412
08:12:39,660 --> 08:12:40,640
such a misfortune

30413
08:12:40,640 --> 08:12:41,840
as this, one cannot see

30414
08:12:41,840 --> 08:12:42,360
too little

30415
08:12:42,360 --> 08:12:43,560
of one's neighbors.

30416
08:12:43,580 --> 08:12:44,180
Assistance

30417
08:12:44,180 --> 08:12:45,120
is impossible.

30418
08:12:45,120 --> 08:12:46,740
Condolence insufferable.

30419
08:12:47,100 --> 08:12:48,260
Let them triumph over us

30420
08:12:48,260 --> 08:12:48,980
at a distance

30421
08:12:48,980 --> 08:12:50,220
and be satisfied.

30422
08:12:50,360 --> 08:12:51,240
She then proceeded

30423
08:12:51,240 --> 08:12:51,800
to inquire

30424
08:12:51,800 --> 08:12:52,440
into the measures

30425
08:12:52,440 --> 08:12:53,040
which her father

30426
08:12:53,040 --> 08:12:53,540
had intended

30427
08:12:53,540 --> 08:12:54,740
to pursue while in town

30428
08:12:54,920 --> 08:12:55,680
for the recovery

30429
08:12:55,680 --> 08:12:56,880
of his daughter.

30430
08:12:57,180 --> 08:12:58,380
He meant, I believe,

30431
08:12:58,500 --> 08:12:59,700
replied Jane.

30432
08:12:59,700 --> 08:13:00,840
To go to Epsom,

30433
08:13:00,840 --> 08:13:01,440
the place

30434
08:13:01,440 --> 08:13:01,700
where they

30435
08:13:01,700 --> 08:13:03,020
last changed horses,

30436
08:13:03,320 --> 08:13:04,380
see the Bostonians.

30437
08:13:04,380 --> 08:13:04,860
And try

30438
08:13:04,860 --> 08:13:05,300
if anything,

30439
08:13:05,300 --> 08:13:05,760
could be made.

30440
08:13:05,760 --> 08:13:06,780
Out from them.

30441
08:13:06,780 --> 08:13:07,940
His principal

30442
08:13:07,940 --> 08:13:08,840
must be to discover

30443
08:13:08,840 --> 08:13:09,260
the number

30444
08:13:09,260 --> 08:13:10,160
of the Hackney coach

30445
08:13:10,160 --> 08:13:10,580
which took

30446
08:13:10,580 --> 08:13:11,780
them from Clapham.

30447
08:13:11,880 --> 08:13:12,620
It had come with a

30448
08:13:12,620 --> 08:13:13,820
fare from London

30449
08:13:13,860 --> 08:13:14,660
and as he thought

30450
08:13:14,660 --> 08:13:15,620
that the circumstance

30451
08:13:15,620 --> 08:13:15,780
of a.

30452
08:13:15,780 --> 08:13:16,800
Gentleman and ladies

30453
08:13:16,800 --> 08:13:17,360
for moving from

30454
08:13:17,360 --> 08:13:18,180
one carriage into.

30455
08:13:18,180 --> 08:13:18,800
Another

30456
08:13:18,800 --> 08:13:19,940
might be remarked

30457
08:13:19,940 --> 08:13:20,640
he meant to make

30458
08:13:20,640 --> 08:13:21,840
inquiries at Clapham

30459
08:13:22,040 --> 08:13:22,500
if he could

30460
08:13:22,500 --> 08:13:23,360
anyhow discover

30461
08:13:23,360 --> 08:13:23,960
at what house

30462
08:13:23,960 --> 08:13:25,080
the coachman had before

30463
08:13:25,080 --> 08:13:26,280
set down his fare.

30464
08:13:26,420 --> 08:13:27,180
He determined

30465
08:13:27,180 --> 08:13:28,320
make inquiries there

30466
08:13:28,320 --> 08:13:28,820
and hoped

30467
08:13:28,820 --> 08:13:29,420
it might not

30468
08:13:29,420 --> 08:13:30,120
be impossible

30469
08:13:30,120 --> 08:13:31,320
to find out the stand

30470
08:13:31,320 --> 08:13:32,520
and number of the coach.

30471
08:13:33,000 --> 08:13:33,660
I do not know

30472
08:13:33,660 --> 08:13:34,580
of any other designs

30473
08:13:34,580 --> 08:13:35,780
that he had formed, but

30474
08:13:35,780 --> 08:13:36,620
he was in such a hurry

30475
08:13:36,620 --> 08:13:37,580
to gone and.

30476
08:13:37,580 --> 08:13:38,460
His spirit so great.

30477
08:13:38,460 --> 08:13:39,720
He just composed that

30478
08:13:39,720 --> 08:13:40,500
I had difficulty

30479
08:13:40,500 --> 08:13:41,180
in finding out,

30480
08:13:41,180 --> 08:13:42,440
even so much as this.

30481
08:13:44,460 --> 08:13:45,660
Chapter 48.

30482
08:13:46,760 --> 08:13:47,600
The whole party

30483
08:13:47,600 --> 08:13:48,200
were in hopes

30484
08:13:48,200 --> 08:13:49,080
of a letter from Mr.

30485
08:13:49,080 --> 08:13:49,380
Bennett

30486
08:13:49,380 --> 08:13:50,400
to the next morning,

30487
08:13:50,400 --> 08:13:51,440
but the Post came in

30488
08:13:51,440 --> 08:13:52,040
without bringing

30489
08:13:52,040 --> 08:13:53,240
a single line from him.

30490
08:13:53,660 --> 08:13:54,500
His Family knew

30491
08:13:54,500 --> 08:13:55,200
him to be on

30492
08:13:55,200 --> 08:13:56,400
all common occasions,

30493
08:13:56,580 --> 08:13:57,660
a most negligent

30494
08:13:57,660 --> 08:13:58,380
and dilatory

30495
08:13:58,380 --> 08:13:59,700
correspondent, but

30496
08:13:59,700 --> 08:14:00,440
at such a time

30497
08:14:00,440 --> 08:14:00,960
they had hoped

30498
08:14:00,960 --> 08:14:02,160
for exertion.

30499
08:14:02,180 --> 08:14:02,820
They were forced

30500
08:14:02,820 --> 08:14:03,380
to conclude

30501
08:14:03,380 --> 08:14:04,440
that he had no pleasing

30502
08:14:04,440 --> 08:14:05,640
intelligence to send.

30503
08:14:05,880 --> 08:14:06,900
But even of that

30504
08:14:06,900 --> 08:14:07,140
they would

30505
08:14:07,140 --> 08:14:07,680
have been glad

30506
08:14:07,680 --> 08:14:08,780
to be certain.

30507
08:14:08,780 --> 08:14:09,120
Mr.

30508
08:14:09,120 --> 08:14:10,040
Gardiner had waited

30509
08:14:10,040 --> 08:14:11,060
only for the letters

30510
08:14:11,060 --> 08:14:12,260
before he set off.

30511
08:14:12,620 --> 08:14:13,500
When he was gone,

30512
08:14:13,500 --> 08:14:14,120
they were certain

30513
08:14:14,120 --> 08:14:14,540
at least

30514
08:14:14,540 --> 08:14:15,060
of receiving

30515
08:14:15,060 --> 08:14:16,160
constant information

30516
08:14:16,160 --> 08:14:17,360
of what was going on,

30517
08:14:17,400 --> 08:14:18,640
and their uncle promised

30518
08:14:18,660 --> 08:14:19,460
at parting

30519
08:14:19,460 --> 08:14:20,460
to prevail on Mr.

30520
08:14:20,460 --> 08:14:20,720
Bennett

30521
08:14:20,720 --> 08:14:21,920
to return to Long Bourn

30522
08:14:22,040 --> 08:14:22,620
as soon as he.

30523
08:14:22,620 --> 08:14:23,180
Could.

30524
08:14:23,180 --> 08:14:24,360
To the great consolation

30525
08:14:24,360 --> 08:14:25,320
of his sister,

30526
08:14:25,320 --> 08:14:26,000
who considered it

30527
08:14:26,000 --> 08:14:27,060
as the only security

30528
08:14:27,060 --> 08:14:27,780
for her husband's

30529
08:14:27,780 --> 08:14:28,680
not being killed

30530
08:14:28,680 --> 08:14:29,520
in a duel.

30531
08:14:29,520 --> 08:14:29,880
Mrs.

30532
08:14:29,880 --> 08:14:30,320
Gardiner

30533
08:14:30,320 --> 08:14:30,960
and the children

30534
08:14:30,960 --> 08:14:31,400
were to remain

30535
08:14:31,400 --> 08:14:32,100
in Hertfordshire

30536
08:14:32,100 --> 08:14:33,300
a few days longer

30537
08:14:33,300 --> 08:14:34,220
as the former thought

30538
08:14:34,220 --> 08:14:34,760
her presence

30539
08:14:34,760 --> 08:14:35,660
might be serviceable

30540
08:14:35,660 --> 08:14:36,840
to her nieces.

30541
08:14:36,840 --> 08:14:37,500
She shared in

30542
08:14:37,500 --> 08:14:38,520
their attendance on Mrs.

30543
08:14:38,520 --> 08:14:39,060
Bennett

30544
08:14:39,060 --> 08:14:40,100
and was a great comfort

30545
08:14:40,100 --> 08:14:40,400
to them

30546
08:14:40,400 --> 08:14:41,000
in their hours

30547
08:14:41,000 --> 08:14:41,940
of freedom.

30548
08:14:41,940 --> 08:14:43,040
Their other aunt also

30549
08:14:43,040 --> 08:14:44,240
visited them frequently,

30550
08:14:44,360 --> 08:14:45,300
and as always,

30551
08:14:45,300 --> 08:14:46,080
as she said,

30552
08:14:46,080 --> 08:14:46,740
with the design

30553
08:14:46,740 --> 08:14:47,300
of cheering

30554
08:14:47,300 --> 08:14:48,500
and heartening them up,

30555
08:14:48,600 --> 08:14:49,800
though as she never came

30556
08:14:49,800 --> 08:14:50,540
without reporting

30557
08:14:50,540 --> 08:14:51,600
some fresh instance

30558
08:14:51,600 --> 08:14:52,140
of Wickham's

30559
08:14:52,140 --> 08:14:52,800
extravagance

30560
08:14:52,800 --> 08:14:54,000
or irregularity,

30561
08:14:54,000 --> 08:14:55,040
she seldom went away

30562
08:14:55,040 --> 08:14:55,800
without leaving them

30563
08:14:55,800 --> 08:14:56,700
more dispirited

30564
08:14:56,700 --> 08:14:57,600
than she found. Them.

30565
08:14:58,740 --> 08:14:59,400
All merit

30566
08:14:59,400 --> 08:15:00,380
and seemed striving

30567
08:15:00,380 --> 08:15:01,820
to blacken the man who.

30568
08:15:01,820 --> 08:15:03,020
But three months before

30569
08:15:03,260 --> 08:15:04,160
had been almost

30570
08:15:04,160 --> 08:15:05,360
an angel of light.

30571
08:15:05,820 --> 08:15:06,540
He was declared

30572
08:15:06,540 --> 08:15:07,160
to be indebted

30573
08:15:07,160 --> 08:15:08,160
to every tradesman

30574
08:15:08,160 --> 08:15:09,000
in the place,

30575
08:15:09,000 --> 08:15:10,020
and his intrigues,

30576
08:15:10,020 --> 08:15:10,740
all honored

30577
08:15:10,740 --> 08:15:11,280
with the title

30578
08:15:11,280 --> 08:15:12,200
of seduction,

30579
08:15:12,200 --> 08:15:13,280
had extended into

30580
08:15:13,280 --> 08:15:14,820
every tradesman family.

30581
08:15:15,260 --> 08:15:16,220
Everybody declared

30582
08:15:16,220 --> 08:15:16,620
that he was

30583
08:15:16,620 --> 08:15:17,240
the wickedest

30584
08:15:17,240 --> 08:15:18,380
young man in the world

30585
08:15:18,380 --> 08:15:19,400
and everybody began

30586
08:15:19,400 --> 08:15:19,980
to find out

30587
08:15:19,980 --> 08:15:20,340
that they had

30588
08:15:20,340 --> 08:15:21,540
always distrusted

30589
08:15:21,540 --> 08:15:22,160
the appearance

30590
08:15:22,160 --> 08:15:23,360
of his goodness.

30591
08:15:23,400 --> 08:15:24,060
Elizabeth,

30592
08:15:24,060 --> 08:15:24,780
though she did not

30593
08:15:24,780 --> 08:15:25,320
credit above

30594
08:15:25,320 --> 08:15:26,520
half of what was said,

30595
08:15:26,640 --> 08:15:27,440
believed enough

30596
08:15:27,440 --> 08:15:27,800
to make her

30597
08:15:27,800 --> 08:15:28,760
former assurance

30598
08:15:28,760 --> 08:15:29,400
of her sister's

30599
08:15:29,400 --> 08:15:30,600
ruin more certain.

30600
08:15:30,720 --> 08:15:31,760
And even Jane,

30601
08:15:31,760 --> 08:15:33,200
who still less of it,

30602
08:15:33,380 --> 08:15:34,860
became almost hopeless.

30603
08:15:35,160 --> 08:15:36,120
More especially

30604
08:15:36,120 --> 08:15:36,620
as the time

30605
08:15:36,620 --> 08:15:37,340
was now, come.

30606
08:15:37,340 --> 08:15:38,460
When if they had.

30607
08:15:38,460 --> 08:15:39,500
Gone to Scotland.

30608
08:15:39,500 --> 08:15:39,920
Which.

30609
08:15:39,920 --> 08:15:40,800
She had never before,

30610
08:15:40,800 --> 08:15:42,000
entirely despaired.

30611
08:15:42,200 --> 08:15:42,780
They must, in

30612
08:15:42,780 --> 08:15:43,760
all probability, have

30613
08:15:43,760 --> 08:15:44,280
gained some

30614
08:15:44,280 --> 08:15:44,960
news of them.

30615
08:15:45,920 --> 08:15:46,260
Mr.

30616
08:15:46,260 --> 08:15:46,940
Gardiner left

30617
08:15:46,940 --> 08:15:48,140
along born on Sunday.

30618
08:15:48,320 --> 08:15:49,100
On Tuesday,

30619
08:15:49,100 --> 08:15:49,880
his wife received

30620
08:15:49,880 --> 08:15:50,940
a letter from him.

30621
08:15:50,940 --> 08:15:52,080
It told them that

30622
08:15:52,080 --> 08:15:53,120
on his arrival

30623
08:15:53,120 --> 08:15:53,880
he had immediately

30624
08:15:53,880 --> 08:15:55,040
found out his brother

30625
08:15:55,040 --> 08:15:55,880
and persuaded him

30626
08:15:55,880 --> 08:15:56,520
to come to Grace

30627
08:15:56,520 --> 08:15:57,480
Church Street.

30628
08:15:57,480 --> 08:15:57,960
But Mr.

30629
08:15:57,960 --> 08:15:58,520
Bennett had been

30630
08:15:58,520 --> 08:15:59,720
to Epsom and Clapham

30631
08:15:59,720 --> 08:16:00,980
before his arrival, but

30632
08:16:00,980 --> 08:16:01,800
without getting any

30633
08:16:01,800 --> 08:16:02,480
satisfactory

30634
08:16:02,480 --> 08:16:03,540
information,

30635
08:16:03,540 --> 08:16:04,200
and that he was

30636
08:16:04,200 --> 08:16:04,880
now determined

30637
08:16:04,880 --> 08:16:05,460
to inquire

30638
08:16:05,460 --> 08:16:05,820
at all

30639
08:16:05,820 --> 08:16:06,740
the principal hotels

30640
08:16:06,740 --> 08:16:08,040
in town as Mr.

30641
08:16:08,040 --> 08:16:08,300
Bennett

30642
08:16:08,300 --> 08:16:09,060
thought it possible

30643
08:16:09,060 --> 08:16:09,260
that they

30644
08:16:09,260 --> 08:16:09,780
might have gone

30645
08:16:09,780 --> 08:16:10,560
to one of them

30646
08:16:10,560 --> 08:16:10,860
on their

30647
08:16:10,860 --> 08:16:12,060
first coming to London

30648
08:16:12,120 --> 08:16:12,660
before they

30649
08:16:12,660 --> 08:16:13,860
procured lodgings.

30650
08:16:14,040 --> 08:16:14,360
Mr.

30651
08:16:14,360 --> 08:16:15,240
Gardner himself

30652
08:16:15,240 --> 08:16:16,100
did not expect

30653
08:16:16,100 --> 08:16:16,860
any success

30654
08:16:16,860 --> 08:16:17,820
from this measure,

30655
08:16:17,820 --> 08:16:18,680
but as his brother

30656
08:16:18,680 --> 08:16:19,580
was eager in it,

30657
08:16:19,580 --> 08:16:20,600
he meant to assist him

30658
08:16:20,600 --> 08:16:21,740
in pursuing it.

30659
08:16:21,740 --> 08:16:22,620
He added that Mr.

30660
08:16:22,620 --> 08:16:23,160
Bennett seemed

30661
08:16:23,160 --> 08:16:24,140
wholly disinclined

30662
08:16:24,140 --> 08:16:24,740
at present

30663
08:16:24,740 --> 08:16:25,740
to leave London

30664
08:16:25,740 --> 08:16:26,360
and promised

30665
08:16:26,360 --> 08:16:27,000
to write again

30666
08:16:27,000 --> 08:16:28,100
very soon.

30667
08:16:28,100 --> 08:16:28,700
There was also

30668
08:16:28,700 --> 08:16:29,400
a postscript

30669
08:16:29,400 --> 08:16:30,600
to this fact.

30670
08:16:30,980 --> 08:16:31,680
I have written

30671
08:16:31,680 --> 08:16:32,720
to Colonel Foster

30672
08:16:32,720 --> 08:16:33,600
to desire him

30673
08:16:33,600 --> 08:16:34,460
to find out,

30674
08:16:34,460 --> 08:16:35,660
if possible,

30675
08:16:35,700 --> 08:16:36,300
from some of

30676
08:16:36,300 --> 08:16:36,920
the young men's

30677
08:16:36,920 --> 08:16:37,520
intimates in

30678
08:16:37,520 --> 08:16:38,540
the regiment,

30679
08:16:38,540 --> 08:16:39,380
whether Wickham has

30680
08:16:39,380 --> 08:16:40,260
any relations

30681
08:16:40,260 --> 08:16:41,460
or connections.

30682
08:16:41,600 --> 08:16:42,440
Who would be likely

30683
08:16:42,440 --> 08:16:43,340
to know

30684
08:16:43,340 --> 08:16:44,520
in what part of the town

30685
08:16:44,520 --> 08:16:45,060
he has now

30686
08:16:45,060 --> 08:16:46,260
concealed himself?

30687
08:16:46,760 --> 08:16:47,780
If there were anyone

30688
08:16:47,780 --> 08:16:49,100
that one could apply to

30689
08:16:49,400 --> 08:16:50,480
with the probability

30690
08:16:50,480 --> 08:16:50,940
gaining

30691
08:16:50,940 --> 08:16:52,140
such a clue as that

30692
08:16:52,800 --> 08:16:53,280
it might be

30693
08:16:53,280 --> 08:16:53,780
of essential

30694
08:16:53,780 --> 08:16:54,480
consequence.

30695
08:16:55,500 --> 08:16:56,300
At present, we have

30696
08:16:56,300 --> 08:16:57,500
nothing to guide us.

30697
08:16:58,160 --> 08:16:59,220
Colonel Foster will,

30698
08:16:59,220 --> 08:17:00,420
I daresay,

30699
08:17:00,540 --> 08:17:01,100
do everything

30700
08:17:01,100 --> 08:17:01,580
in his power

30701
08:17:01,580 --> 08:17:02,700
to satisfy us

30702
08:17:02,700 --> 08:17:03,780
on this head.

30703
08:17:03,780 --> 08:17:05,520
But on second thoughts.

30704
08:17:05,820 --> 08:17:06,540
Perhaps Lizzy

30705
08:17:06,540 --> 08:17:06,980
could tell us

30706
08:17:06,980 --> 08:17:07,740
what relations

30707
08:17:07,740 --> 08:17:08,000
he has

30708
08:17:08,000 --> 08:17:08,480
now living

30709
08:17:08,480 --> 08:17:09,140
better than any

30710
08:17:09,140 --> 08:17:10,340
other person.

30711
08:17:11,060 --> 08:17:11,600
Elizabeth

30712
08:17:11,600 --> 08:17:12,480
was at no loss

30713
08:17:12,480 --> 08:17:13,100
to understand

30714
08:17:13,100 --> 08:17:13,520
from whence

30715
08:17:13,520 --> 08:17:14,220
this deference

30716
08:17:14,220 --> 08:17:14,480
to her

30717
08:17:14,480 --> 08:17:15,680
authority proceeded.

30718
08:17:15,780 --> 08:17:16,140
But it was.

30719
08:17:16,140 --> 08:17:16,820
Not in her power

30720
08:17:16,820 --> 08:17:17,820
to give any information

30721
08:17:17,820 --> 08:17:18,800
of so satisfactory

30722
08:17:18,800 --> 08:17:19,220
a nature

30723
08:17:19,220 --> 08:17:20,420
as the compliment.

30724
08:17:21,000 --> 08:17:21,540
She had never

30725
08:17:21,540 --> 08:17:22,260
heard of his having

30726
08:17:22,260 --> 08:17:23,360
had any relations

30727
08:17:23,360 --> 08:17:24,200
except to father

30728
08:17:24,200 --> 08:17:25,620
and mother, both of whom

30729
08:17:25,620 --> 08:17:26,240
had been dead

30730
08:17:26,240 --> 08:17:27,380
many years.

30731
08:17:27,380 --> 08:17:28,260
It was possible,

30732
08:17:28,260 --> 08:17:28,680
however, that

30733
08:17:28,680 --> 08:17:29,720
some of his companions,

30734
08:17:29,720 --> 08:17:30,600
the blank share,

30735
08:17:30,600 --> 08:17:31,220
might be able

30736
08:17:31,220 --> 08:17:31,520
to give

30737
08:17:31,520 --> 08:17:32,720
more information.

30738
08:17:32,720 --> 08:17:33,120
And though

30739
08:17:33,120 --> 08:17:33,600
she was not

30740
08:17:33,600 --> 08:17:34,320
very sanguine

30741
08:17:34,320 --> 08:17:35,360
in expecting it,

30742
08:17:35,360 --> 08:17:36,200
the application

30743
08:17:36,200 --> 08:17:36,840
was something

30744
08:17:36,840 --> 08:17:38,040
to look forward to

30745
08:17:38,400 --> 08:17:39,680
every day as long born

30746
08:17:39,680 --> 08:17:40,140
was now

30747
08:17:40,140 --> 08:17:41,420
a day of anxiety.

30748
08:17:41,660 --> 08:17:42,620
But the most anxious

30749
08:17:42,620 --> 08:17:43,500
part of each was

30750
08:17:43,500 --> 08:17:44,100
when the post

30751
08:17:44,100 --> 08:17:45,260
was expected.

30752
08:17:45,260 --> 08:17:46,400
The arrival of letters

30753
08:17:46,400 --> 08:17:47,480
was the grand object

30754
08:17:47,480 --> 08:17:48,260
of every morning.

30755
08:17:48,260 --> 08:17:49,440
Some patience

30756
08:17:49,440 --> 08:17:50,220
through letters,

30757
08:17:50,220 --> 08:17:51,380
whatever of good or bad

30758
08:17:51,380 --> 08:17:51,780
was to be

30759
08:17:51,780 --> 08:17:53,040
told to be communicated.

30760
08:17:53,280 --> 08:17:54,560
And every succeeding day

30761
08:17:54,560 --> 08:17:55,220
was expected

30762
08:17:55,220 --> 08:17:55,580
to bring

30763
08:17:55,580 --> 08:17:57,000
some news of importance.

30764
08:17:57,540 --> 08:17:58,460
But before they heard

30765
08:17:58,460 --> 08:17:59,180
again, Mr.

30766
08:17:59,180 --> 08:18:00,420
Gardiner, a letter

30767
08:18:00,420 --> 08:18:01,760
arrived for their father

30768
08:18:01,760 --> 08:18:02,960
from a different quarter

30769
08:18:03,180 --> 08:18:03,680
from Mr.

30770
08:18:03,680 --> 08:18:04,560
Collins.

30771
08:18:04,560 --> 08:18:05,660
Which, as Jane, had.

30772
08:18:05,660 --> 08:18:06,560
Received directions

30773
08:18:06,560 --> 08:18:06,980
to open

30774
08:18:06,980 --> 08:18:07,880
all that came for him

30775
08:18:07,880 --> 08:18:08,780
in his absence.

30776
08:18:08,780 --> 08:18:09,980
She accordingly read

30777
08:18:10,160 --> 08:18:11,100
and Elizabeth

30778
08:18:11,100 --> 08:18:11,520
who knew

30779
08:18:11,520 --> 08:18:12,440
what curiosities

30780
08:18:12,440 --> 08:18:13,640
his letters always were

30781
08:18:13,800 --> 08:18:14,660
looked over her

30782
08:18:14,660 --> 08:18:15,860
and read it likewise.

30783
08:18:16,200 --> 08:18:17,280
It was as follows.

30784
08:18:18,480 --> 08:18:19,680
My dear sir,

30785
08:18:20,000 --> 08:18:21,060
I feel myself

30786
08:18:21,060 --> 08:18:22,020
called upon

30787
08:18:22,020 --> 08:18:22,980
by our relationship

30788
08:18:22,980 --> 08:18:24,680
and my situation in life

30789
08:18:24,900 --> 08:18:25,920
to condole with you

30790
08:18:25,920 --> 08:18:26,120
on the

30791
08:18:26,120 --> 08:18:27,320
grievous affliction

30792
08:18:27,320 --> 08:18:28,560
you are now under,

30793
08:18:28,880 --> 08:18:29,340
of which

30794
08:18:29,340 --> 08:18:29,960
we were yesterday

30795
08:18:29,960 --> 08:18:30,960
informed by a letter

30796
08:18:30,960 --> 08:18:32,160
from Hertfordshire.

30797
08:18:32,280 --> 08:18:33,480
Be assured, my dear

30798
08:18:33,480 --> 08:18:34,820
sir, that Mrs.

30799
08:18:34,820 --> 08:18:36,380
Collins and myself

30800
08:18:36,500 --> 08:18:37,940
sincerely sympathize

30801
08:18:38,100 --> 08:18:38,520
you and

30802
08:18:38,520 --> 08:18:39,180
all your

30803
08:18:39,180 --> 08:18:40,320
respectable family

30804
08:18:40,320 --> 08:18:40,820
in your

30805
08:18:40,820 --> 08:18:42,060
present distress,

30806
08:18:42,180 --> 08:18:43,280
which must be of the

30807
08:18:43,280 --> 08:18:44,480
bitterest kind,

30808
08:18:44,580 --> 08:18:45,600
because proceeding

30809
08:18:45,600 --> 08:18:46,220
from a cause

30810
08:18:46,220 --> 08:18:47,340
which no time

30811
08:18:47,340 --> 08:18:48,540
can remove,

30812
08:18:48,740 --> 08:18:49,640
no arguments

30813
08:18:49,640 --> 08:18:50,280
shall be wanting

30814
08:18:50,280 --> 08:18:50,900
on my part

30815
08:18:50,900 --> 08:18:51,680
that can alleviate

30816
08:18:51,680 --> 08:18:53,520
so severe a misfortune,

30817
08:18:53,880 --> 08:18:54,880
or that may comfort

30818
08:18:54,880 --> 08:18:56,220
you under a circumstance

30819
08:18:56,220 --> 08:18:57,060
that must be

30820
08:18:57,060 --> 08:18:58,080
of all others

30821
08:18:58,080 --> 08:18:58,500
the most

30822
08:18:58,500 --> 08:18:59,780
afflicting to a parent's

30823
08:18:59,780 --> 08:19:00,620
mind.

30824
08:19:00,620 --> 08:19:01,200
The death of

30825
08:19:01,200 --> 08:19:01,760
your daughter

30826
08:19:01,760 --> 08:19:02,280
would have been

30827
08:19:02,280 --> 08:19:02,940
a blessing

30828
08:19:02,940 --> 08:19:04,140
in comparison of this.

30829
08:19:04,400 --> 08:19:05,180
And it is the

30830
08:19:05,180 --> 08:19:06,380
more to be lamented

30831
08:19:06,480 --> 08:19:07,460
because there is reason

30832
08:19:07,460 --> 08:19:08,180
to suppose,

30833
08:19:08,180 --> 08:19:08,760
as my dear

30834
08:19:08,760 --> 08:19:09,540
Charlotte informs

30835
08:19:09,540 --> 08:19:10,140
me, that

30836
08:19:10,140 --> 08:19:11,460
this licentiousness

30837
08:19:11,460 --> 08:19:12,080
of behavior

30838
08:19:12,080 --> 08:19:12,920
in your daughter

30839
08:19:12,920 --> 08:19:13,700
has proceeded

30840
08:19:13,700 --> 08:19:14,420
from a faulty

30841
08:19:14,420 --> 08:19:15,620
degree of indulgence,

30842
08:19:15,780 --> 08:19:17,240
though at the same time,

30843
08:19:17,360 --> 08:19:18,320
for the consolation

30844
08:19:18,320 --> 08:19:19,160
of yourself and Mrs.

30845
08:19:19,160 --> 08:19:19,740
Bennett,

30846
08:19:19,740 --> 08:19:20,820
I am inclined to think

30847
08:19:20,820 --> 08:19:21,980
that her own disposition

30848
08:19:21,980 --> 08:19:23,660
must be naturally bad,

30849
08:19:23,840 --> 08:19:24,500
or she could not

30850
08:19:24,500 --> 08:19:25,020
be guilty

30851
08:19:25,020 --> 08:19:26,180
of such an enormity.

30852
08:19:26,180 --> 08:19:27,540
And so early in age,

30853
08:19:28,100 --> 08:19:29,300
howsoever that may be,

30854
08:19:29,460 --> 08:19:30,740
you are grievously

30855
08:19:30,740 --> 08:19:31,560
to be pitied,

30856
08:19:31,560 --> 08:19:32,340
in which opinion

30857
08:19:32,340 --> 08:19:33,300
I am not only joined

30858
08:19:33,300 --> 08:19:33,840
by Mrs.

30859
08:19:33,840 --> 08:19:35,220
Collins, but likewise

30860
08:19:35,220 --> 08:19:36,500
by Lady Catherine

30861
08:19:36,500 --> 08:19:37,700
and her daughter,

30862
08:19:37,920 --> 08:19:39,120
to whom I have related

30863
08:19:39,120 --> 08:19:40,140
the affair.

30864
08:19:40,140 --> 08:19:41,100
They agree with me

30865
08:19:41,100 --> 08:19:41,960
in apprehending

30866
08:19:41,960 --> 08:19:43,320
that this false step

30867
08:19:43,320 --> 08:19:44,400
in one daughter

30868
08:19:44,400 --> 08:19:45,360
would be injurious

30869
08:19:45,360 --> 08:19:46,100
to the fortunes

30870
08:19:46,100 --> 08:19:47,300
of all the others.

30871
08:19:47,340 --> 08:19:48,360
For who,

30872
08:19:48,360 --> 08:19:48,920
as Lady

30873
08:19:48,920 --> 08:19:49,800
Catherine herself

30874
08:19:49,800 --> 08:19:51,200
condescendingly says,

30875
08:19:51,480 --> 08:19:52,860
will connect themselves

30876
08:19:52,860 --> 08:19:54,240
with such a family.

30877
08:19:54,840 --> 08:19:56,100
And this consideration

30878
08:19:56,100 --> 08:19:57,480
leads me to reflect

30879
08:19:57,660 --> 08:19:58,860
with augmented

30880
08:19:58,860 --> 08:19:59,760
satisfaction

30881
08:19:59,760 --> 08:20:00,480
on a certain

30882
08:20:00,480 --> 08:20:01,940
event of last November

30883
08:20:02,220 --> 08:20:02,460
four.

30884
08:20:02,460 --> 08:20:03,500
Had it been otherwise,

30885
08:20:03,500 --> 08:20:04,140
I must have

30886
08:20:04,140 --> 08:20:04,760
been involved

30887
08:20:04,760 --> 08:20:05,280
in all

30888
08:20:05,280 --> 08:20:05,880
your sorrow

30889
08:20:05,880 --> 08:20:06,920
and disgrace.

30890
08:20:06,920 --> 08:20:07,980
Let me then advise

30891
08:20:07,980 --> 08:20:08,760
you, dear sir,

30892
08:20:08,760 --> 08:20:09,800
to console yourself

30893
08:20:09,800 --> 08:20:10,980
as much as possible

30894
08:20:10,980 --> 08:20:11,700
to throw off her

30895
08:20:11,700 --> 08:20:12,440
unworthy child

30896
08:20:12,440 --> 08:20:12,720
from your

30897
08:20:12,720 --> 08:20:13,760
affection forever

30898
08:20:13,760 --> 08:20:14,520
and leave her

30899
08:20:14,520 --> 08:20:15,360
to reap the fruits

30900
08:20:15,360 --> 08:20:16,580
of her own happiness.

30901
08:20:17,900 --> 08:20:18,480
Now I am

30902
08:20:18,480 --> 08:20:19,800
dear sir, etc., etc..

30903
08:20:21,000 --> 08:20:21,320
Mr.

30904
08:20:21,320 --> 08:20:21,900
Gardner did

30905
08:20:21,900 --> 08:20:22,640
not write again

30906
08:20:22,640 --> 08:20:23,400
till he had received

30907
08:20:23,400 --> 08:20:23,940
an answer

30908
08:20:23,940 --> 08:20:25,140
from Colonel Forrester.

30909
08:20:25,220 --> 08:20:26,240
And then he had nothing

30910
08:20:26,240 --> 08:20:26,780
of a pleasant

30911
08:20:26,780 --> 08:20:27,980
nature to send.

30912
08:20:28,020 --> 08:20:28,880
It was not known

30913
08:20:28,880 --> 08:20:29,520
that Wickham had a.

30914
08:20:29,520 --> 08:20:30,440
Single relationship

30915
08:20:30,440 --> 08:20:30,720
with whom

30916
08:20:30,720 --> 08:20:31,200
he kept up

30917
08:20:31,200 --> 08:20:32,360
any connection,

30918
08:20:32,360 --> 08:20:33,020
and it was certain

30919
08:20:33,020 --> 08:20:33,380
that he had

30920
08:20:33,380 --> 08:20:34,580
no one near living.

30921
08:20:34,740 --> 08:20:35,360
His former

30922
08:20:35,360 --> 08:20:36,140
acquaintances had

30923
08:20:36,140 --> 08:20:37,040
been numerous,

30924
08:20:37,040 --> 08:20:37,560
but since

30925
08:20:37,560 --> 08:20:38,100
he had been in the.

30926
08:20:38,100 --> 08:20:39,320
Militia it did not.

30927
08:20:39,320 --> 08:20:39,720
Appear that

30928
08:20:39,720 --> 08:20:40,440
he was on terms

30929
08:20:40,440 --> 08:20:41,580
of particular friendship

30930
08:20:41,580 --> 08:20:42,780
with any of them.

30931
08:20:42,800 --> 08:20:43,640
There was no one

30932
08:20:43,640 --> 08:20:44,120
there for

30933
08:20:44,120 --> 08:20:45,080
who could be pointed out

30934
08:20:45,080 --> 08:20:45,800
as likely

30935
08:20:45,800 --> 08:20:47,000
give any news of him.

30936
08:20:47,280 --> 08:20:47,660
And in the

30937
08:20:47,660 --> 08:20:48,380
wretched state.

30938
08:20:48,380 --> 08:20:49,580
Of his own finances,

30939
08:20:49,680 --> 08:20:50,280
there was a very

30940
08:20:50,280 --> 08:20:51,120
powerful motive

30941
08:20:51,120 --> 08:20:52,140
for secrecy.

30942
08:20:52,140 --> 08:20:52,680
In addition

30943
08:20:52,680 --> 08:20:53,840
to his fear of discovery

30944
08:20:53,840 --> 08:20:55,040
by Lydia's relations,

30945
08:20:55,320 --> 08:20:55,620
for it

30946
08:20:55,620 --> 08:20:56,660
had just transpired

30947
08:20:56,660 --> 08:20:57,240
that he had left

30948
08:20:57,240 --> 08:20:58,580
gaming debts behind him

30949
08:20:58,580 --> 08:20:59,000
to a very

30950
08:20:59,000 --> 08:21:00,200
considerable amount.

30951
08:21:00,500 --> 08:21:01,320
Colonel Forrester

30952
08:21:01,320 --> 08:21:01,880
believed that

30953
08:21:01,880 --> 08:21:03,260
more than ?1,000

30954
08:21:03,260 --> 08:21:04,020
would be necessary

30955
08:21:04,020 --> 08:21:05,220
to clear his expenses.

30956
08:21:05,220 --> 08:21:06,180
Brighton.

30957
08:21:06,180 --> 08:21:07,140
He owed a great

30958
08:21:07,140 --> 08:21:08,220
deal in town.

30959
08:21:08,220 --> 08:21:08,900
But his debts.

30960
08:21:08,900 --> 08:21:09,360
Of honor

30961
08:21:09,360 --> 08:21:09,720
were still

30962
08:21:09,720 --> 08:21:10,920
more formidable.

30963
08:21:11,000 --> 08:21:11,340
Mr.

30964
08:21:11,340 --> 08:21:12,320
Gardner did not attempt

30965
08:21:12,320 --> 08:21:12,840
to conceal

30966
08:21:12,840 --> 08:21:13,560
these particulars

30967
08:21:13,560 --> 08:21:14,040
from the long

30968
08:21:14,040 --> 08:21:15,240
born family.

30969
08:21:15,260 --> 08:21:16,160
Jane heard them

30970
08:21:16,160 --> 08:21:17,360
with horror.

30971
08:21:17,400 --> 08:21:18,560
Games after.

30972
08:21:18,560 --> 08:21:19,520
She cried.

30973
08:21:19,520 --> 08:21:19,880
This is

30974
08:21:19,880 --> 08:21:21,200
wholly unexpected.

30975
08:21:21,480 --> 08:21:23,120
I had not an idea of it.

30976
08:21:23,840 --> 08:21:24,200
Mr.

30977
08:21:24,200 --> 08:21:24,960
Gardner added

30978
08:21:24,960 --> 08:21:25,760
in his letter

30979
08:21:25,760 --> 08:21:26,640
that they might expect

30980
08:21:26,640 --> 08:21:27,480
to see their father

30981
08:21:27,480 --> 08:21:27,900
at home

30982
08:21:27,900 --> 08:21:29,000
on the following day,

30983
08:21:29,000 --> 08:21:30,200
which was Saturday,

30984
08:21:30,300 --> 08:21:31,380
rendered spiritless

30985
08:21:31,380 --> 08:21:31,640
by the

30986
08:21:31,640 --> 08:21:32,360
ill success

30987
08:21:32,360 --> 08:21:33,560
of all their endeavors.

30988
08:21:33,680 --> 08:21:34,260
He had yielded

30989
08:21:34,260 --> 08:21:34,760
to his brother

30990
08:21:34,760 --> 08:21:35,580
in law's entreaty

30991
08:21:35,580 --> 08:21:35,940
that he would

30992
08:21:35,940 --> 08:21:37,140
return to his family

30993
08:21:37,260 --> 08:21:38,240
and leave it to him

30994
08:21:38,240 --> 08:21:38,520
to do

30995
08:21:38,520 --> 08:21:39,320
whatever occasion

30996
08:21:39,320 --> 08:21:39,980
might suggest

30997
08:21:39,980 --> 08:21:40,940
to be advisable

30998
08:21:40,940 --> 08:21:41,660
for continuing

30999
08:21:41,660 --> 08:21:42,840
their pursuit.

31000
08:21:42,840 --> 08:21:43,340
When Mrs.

31001
08:21:43,340 --> 08:21:43,760
Bennett was

31002
08:21:43,760 --> 08:21:44,540
told of this,

31003
08:21:44,540 --> 08:21:45,060
she did not

31004
08:21:45,060 --> 08:21:46,020
express so much.

31005
08:21:46,020 --> 08:21:46,800
Satisfaction

31006
08:21:46,800 --> 08:21:47,360
as her children

31007
08:21:47,360 --> 08:21:48,200
expected,

31008
08:21:48,200 --> 08:21:48,900
considering what

31009
08:21:48,900 --> 08:21:50,240
her anxiety for his life

31010
08:21:50,240 --> 08:21:51,440
had been before.

31011
08:21:51,680 --> 08:21:53,360
What is he coming home

31012
08:21:53,580 --> 08:21:54,800
and without Lydia?

31013
08:21:55,100 --> 08:21:56,060
She cried.

31014
08:21:56,060 --> 08:21:56,460
Sure,

31015
08:21:56,460 --> 08:21:57,620
he will not leave London

31016
08:21:57,620 --> 08:21:57,920
before

31017
08:21:57,920 --> 08:21:59,100
he has found them.

31018
08:21:59,100 --> 08:22:00,320
Who is to fight Wickham

31019
08:22:00,320 --> 08:22:01,520
and make him marry her?

31020
08:22:01,620 --> 08:22:03,200
If he comes away as.

31021
08:22:03,200 --> 08:22:04,320
Mrs. Gardner to.

31022
08:22:04,320 --> 08:22:05,460
Wish to be at home.

31023
08:22:05,460 --> 08:22:06,140
It was settled

31024
08:22:06,140 --> 08:22:06,600
that she and

31025
08:22:06,600 --> 08:22:07,040
the children

31026
08:22:07,040 --> 08:22:07,820
should go to London

31027
08:22:07,820 --> 08:22:08,520
at the same time

31028
08:22:08,520 --> 08:22:08,880
that Mr.

31029
08:22:08,880 --> 08:22:10,080
Bennett came from it.

31030
08:22:10,220 --> 08:22:10,740
The coach

31031
08:22:10,740 --> 08:22:11,600
therefore took them

31032
08:22:11,600 --> 08:22:12,260
at the first stage

31033
08:22:12,260 --> 08:22:13,160
of their journey

31034
08:22:13,160 --> 08:22:14,220
and brought Master

31035
08:22:14,220 --> 08:22:15,420
back to Long Bourne.

31036
08:22:15,860 --> 08:22:16,220
Mrs.

31037
08:22:16,220 --> 08:22:17,100
Gardner went away

31038
08:22:17,100 --> 08:22:18,120
in all the perplexity

31039
08:22:18,120 --> 08:22:18,840
about Elizabeth

31040
08:22:18,840 --> 08:22:19,020
and her

31041
08:22:19,020 --> 08:22:20,060
Derbyshire friend

31042
08:22:20,060 --> 08:22:20,400
that had

31043
08:22:20,400 --> 08:22:21,080
attended her from

31044
08:22:21,080 --> 08:22:22,280
that part of the world.

31045
08:22:22,460 --> 08:22:23,580
His name had never been

31046
08:22:23,580 --> 08:22:24,680
voluntarily mentioned

31047
08:22:24,680 --> 08:22:25,520
before them by her.

31048
08:22:25,520 --> 08:22:26,720
Niece and the kind.

31049
08:22:26,720 --> 08:22:27,980
Of half expectation

31050
08:22:27,980 --> 08:22:28,440
which Mrs.

31051
08:22:28,440 --> 08:22:29,580
Gardner had formed

31052
08:22:29,580 --> 08:22:29,940
of there

31053
08:22:29,940 --> 08:22:30,560
being followed

31054
08:22:30,560 --> 08:22:31,740
by a letter from him,

31055
08:22:31,740 --> 08:22:33,000
had ended in nothing.

31056
08:22:33,380 --> 08:22:34,460
Elizabeth had received

31057
08:22:34,460 --> 08:22:35,660
none since her return

31058
08:22:35,820 --> 08:22:36,440
that could come

31059
08:22:36,440 --> 08:22:37,520
from Pemberley.

31060
08:22:37,520 --> 08:22:38,660
The present unhappy

31061
08:22:38,660 --> 08:22:39,660
state of the family

31062
08:22:39,660 --> 08:22:40,040
rendered

31063
08:22:40,040 --> 08:22:41,040
any other excuse

31064
08:22:41,040 --> 08:22:41,640
for the onus

31065
08:22:41,640 --> 08:22:42,320
of her spirits

31066
08:22:42,320 --> 08:22:43,500
unnecessary.

31067
08:22:43,500 --> 08:22:44,360
Nothing, therefore,

31068
08:22:44,360 --> 08:22:44,640
could be

31069
08:22:44,640 --> 08:22:45,480
fairly conjectured

31070
08:22:45,480 --> 08:22:46,640
from that, though.

31071
08:22:46,640 --> 08:22:47,360
Elizabeth,

31072
08:22:47,360 --> 08:22:48,380
who was by this time

31073
08:22:48,380 --> 08:22:48,900
tolerably

31074
08:22:48,900 --> 08:22:49,620
well acquainted with

31075
08:22:49,620 --> 08:22:50,640
her own feelings,

31076
08:22:50,640 --> 08:22:51,720
was perfectly aware

31077
08:22:51,720 --> 08:22:52,760
that had she know

31078
08:22:52,760 --> 08:22:53,960
nothing of Darcy,

31079
08:22:53,960 --> 08:22:54,680
she could have borne

31080
08:22:54,680 --> 08:22:55,040
the dread

31081
08:22:55,040 --> 08:22:55,880
of Lydia's infamy

31082
08:22:55,880 --> 08:22:57,080
somewhat better.

31083
08:22:57,080 --> 08:22:57,540
It would have

31084
08:22:57,540 --> 08:22:58,740
spared her, she thought,

31085
08:22:58,740 --> 08:22:59,540
one sleepless

31086
08:22:59,540 --> 08:23:00,740
night out of two.

31087
08:23:01,500 --> 08:23:01,940
When Mr.

31088
08:23:01,940 --> 08:23:02,760
Bennett arrived,

31089
08:23:02,760 --> 08:23:03,800
he all the appearance

31090
08:23:03,800 --> 08:23:04,380
of his usual

31091
08:23:04,380 --> 08:23:05,660
philosophic composure.

31092
08:23:06,020 --> 08:23:07,320
He said as little as

31093
08:23:07,320 --> 08:23:07,820
he had ever been

31094
08:23:07,820 --> 08:23:09,020
in the habit of saying,

31095
08:23:09,120 --> 08:23:09,900
made no mention

31096
08:23:09,900 --> 08:23:10,460
of the business

31097
08:23:10,460 --> 08:23:11,640
that had taken him away.

31098
08:23:11,640 --> 08:23:12,560
And it was some time

31099
08:23:12,560 --> 08:23:13,400
before his daughters

31100
08:23:13,400 --> 08:23:13,920
had courage

31101
08:23:13,920 --> 08:23:15,120
to speak of it.

31102
08:23:15,200 --> 08:23:15,920
It was not until

31103
08:23:15,920 --> 08:23:16,640
the afternoon

31104
08:23:16,640 --> 08:23:17,240
when he had joined them

31105
08:23:17,240 --> 08:23:17,900
at tea

31106
08:23:17,900 --> 08:23:18,840
that Elizabeth ventured

31107
08:23:18,840 --> 08:23:19,340
to introduce.

31108
08:23:19,340 --> 08:23:20,340
The subject.

31109
08:23:20,340 --> 08:23:21,300
And then on her

31110
08:23:21,300 --> 08:23:21,680
briefly

31111
08:23:21,680 --> 08:23:22,640
expressing her sorrow

31112
08:23:22,640 --> 08:23:22,880
for what

31113
08:23:22,880 --> 08:23:24,000
he must have endured,

31114
08:23:24,000 --> 08:23:25,200
he replied.

31115
08:23:25,620 --> 08:23:26,820
Say nothing of that.

31116
08:23:26,880 --> 08:23:27,600
Who should suffer

31117
08:23:27,600 --> 08:23:28,700
but myself?

31118
08:23:28,700 --> 08:23:29,840
It has been my own doing

31119
08:23:29,840 --> 08:23:30,840
and I ought to feel it.

31120
08:23:32,340 --> 08:23:33,320
You must not be too

31121
08:23:33,320 --> 08:23:34,520
severe upon yourself.

31122
08:23:34,820 --> 08:23:36,020
Replied Elizabeth.

31123
08:23:37,280 --> 08:23:38,240
You may well warn me

31124
08:23:38,240 --> 08:23:39,440
against such an evil.

31125
08:23:39,960 --> 08:23:40,700
Human nature

31126
08:23:40,700 --> 08:23:41,340
is so prone

31127
08:23:41,340 --> 08:23:42,540
to fall into it.

31128
08:23:42,660 --> 08:23:43,860
No, Lizzie,

31129
08:23:44,340 --> 08:23:45,480
let me once in my life

31130
08:23:45,480 --> 08:23:46,400
feel how much I have

31131
08:23:46,400 --> 08:23:47,600
been to blame.

31132
08:23:48,840 --> 08:23:49,680
I'm not afraid of

31133
08:23:49,680 --> 08:23:50,520
being overpowered

31134
08:23:50,520 --> 08:23:51,660
by the impression

31135
08:23:51,660 --> 08:23:52,820
it will pass away soon

31136
08:23:52,820 --> 08:23:54,020
enough.

31137
08:23:54,980 --> 08:23:55,700
Do you suppose, then,

31138
08:23:55,700 --> 08:23:56,900
to be in London?

31139
08:23:57,260 --> 08:23:57,620
Yes.

31140
08:23:57,620 --> 08:23:57,980
Where else

31141
08:23:57,980 --> 08:23:58,580
can they be so

31142
08:23:58,580 --> 08:23:59,780
well concealed?

31143
08:24:00,440 --> 08:24:01,040
And Lydia

31144
08:24:01,040 --> 08:24:01,620
used to want to

31145
08:24:01,620 --> 08:24:02,820
go to London.

31146
08:24:02,840 --> 08:24:04,040
Added Kitty.

31147
08:24:04,520 --> 08:24:05,720
She's happy then.

31148
08:24:05,760 --> 08:24:07,020
Said her father dryly.

31149
08:24:07,260 --> 08:24:08,160
And her residents

31150
08:24:08,160 --> 08:24:09,140
there will probably be

31151
08:24:09,140 --> 08:24:10,340
of some duration.

31152
08:24:10,680 --> 08:24:11,040
Then,

31153
08:24:11,040 --> 08:24:12,140
after a short silence,

31154
08:24:12,140 --> 08:24:13,340
he continued.

31155
08:24:13,680 --> 08:24:14,100
Lizzie,

31156
08:24:14,100 --> 08:24:15,420
I beg you no ill will

31157
08:24:15,420 --> 08:24:16,460
for being justified

31158
08:24:16,460 --> 08:24:17,420
in your advice to me

31159
08:24:17,420 --> 08:24:18,440
last May, which,

31160
08:24:18,440 --> 08:24:19,640
considering the event,

31161
08:24:19,920 --> 08:24:21,000
shows some greatness

31162
08:24:21,000 --> 08:24:22,200
of mind.

31163
08:24:22,200 --> 08:24:23,040
They were interrupted

31164
08:24:23,040 --> 08:24:23,900
by Miss Bennett,

31165
08:24:23,900 --> 08:24:24,720
who came to fetch her

31166
08:24:24,720 --> 08:24:25,920
mother's tea.

31167
08:24:26,000 --> 08:24:27,200
This is a parade.

31168
08:24:27,260 --> 08:24:27,960
Cried he,

31169
08:24:27,960 --> 08:24:29,160
which does one good.

31170
08:24:29,400 --> 08:24:30,740
It gives such elegance

31171
08:24:30,740 --> 08:24:31,940
to misfortune.

31172
08:24:32,040 --> 08:24:32,600
Another day

31173
08:24:32,600 --> 08:24:33,620
I will do the same.

31174
08:24:33,620 --> 08:24:34,100
I will sit

31175
08:24:34,100 --> 08:24:35,040
in my library,

31176
08:24:35,040 --> 08:24:35,940
in my nightcap

31177
08:24:35,940 --> 08:24:37,140
and powdering gown

31178
08:24:37,140 --> 08:24:38,180
and give as much trouble

31179
08:24:38,180 --> 08:24:39,240
as I can.

31180
08:24:39,240 --> 08:24:40,500
Or perhaps I may defer

31181
08:24:40,500 --> 08:24:41,940
it till Kitty runs away.

31182
08:24:43,320 --> 08:24:44,040
I am not

31183
08:24:44,040 --> 08:24:45,240
going to run away, Papa.

31184
08:24:45,380 --> 08:24:46,580
Said Kitty, frightfully.

31185
08:24:46,760 --> 08:24:47,700
If I should ever go

31186
08:24:47,700 --> 08:24:48,300
to Brighton.

31187
08:24:48,300 --> 08:24:48,980
I would behave

31188
08:24:48,980 --> 08:24:50,180
better than Lydia.

31189
08:24:50,540 --> 08:24:51,900
You go to Brighton.

31190
08:24:52,140 --> 08:24:53,100
I would not trust you

31191
08:24:53,100 --> 08:24:54,620
so near it as Eastbourne

31192
08:24:54,620 --> 08:24:55,820
for ?50.

31193
08:24:56,040 --> 08:24:56,820
No, Kitty,

31194
08:24:56,820 --> 08:24:57,360
I have at least

31195
08:24:57,360 --> 08:24:58,560
learned to be cautious.

31196
08:24:58,620 --> 08:24:59,340
And you will feel

31197
08:24:59,340 --> 08:25:00,380
the effects it.

31198
08:25:00,380 --> 08:25:01,640
No officer is ever

31199
08:25:01,640 --> 08:25:03,060
to enter my house again,

31200
08:25:03,180 --> 08:25:04,280
nor even to pass through

31201
08:25:04,280 --> 08:25:05,480
the village.

31202
08:25:05,540 --> 08:25:06,360
Bulls will be

31203
08:25:06,360 --> 08:25:07,580
absolutely prohibited

31204
08:25:07,580 --> 08:25:08,580
unless you stand up

31205
08:25:08,580 --> 08:25:09,780
with one of your sisters

31206
08:25:09,980 --> 08:25:10,380
and you are

31207
08:25:10,380 --> 08:25:10,820
never to

31208
08:25:10,820 --> 08:25:12,020
stir out of doors

31209
08:25:12,140 --> 08:25:12,980
till you can prove

31210
08:25:12,980 --> 08:25:13,800
that you have spent

31211
08:25:13,800 --> 08:25:15,320
10 minutes of every day

31212
08:25:15,320 --> 08:25:16,620
in a rational manner.

31213
08:25:17,540 --> 08:25:18,540
Kitty, who took.

31214
08:25:18,540 --> 08:25:19,340
All these threats

31215
08:25:19,340 --> 08:25:20,540
in a serious

31216
08:25:20,540 --> 08:25:21,740
began to cry.

31217
08:25:21,960 --> 08:25:23,660
Well, well, said he.

31218
08:25:23,820 --> 08:25:24,840
Do not make yourself

31219
08:25:24,840 --> 08:25:25,680
unhappy

31220
08:25:25,680 --> 08:25:26,780
if you are a good girl

31221
08:25:26,780 --> 08:25:27,980
for the next ten years.

31222
08:25:28,200 --> 08:25:29,220
I will take you to a

31223
08:25:29,220 --> 08:25:29,900
review at the

31224
08:25:29,900 --> 08:25:30,480
end of them.

31225
08:25:32,540 --> 08:25:33,740
Chapter 49.

31226
08:25:34,860 --> 08:25:36,060
Two days after Mr.

31227
08:25:36,060 --> 08:25:37,080
Bennett's return.

31228
08:25:37,080 --> 08:25:38,280
As Jane and Elizabeth

31229
08:25:38,280 --> 08:25:39,180
were walking together

31230
08:25:39,180 --> 08:25:39,780
in the shrubbery

31231
08:25:39,780 --> 08:25:40,880
behind the house.

31232
08:25:40,880 --> 08:25:41,900
They saw the housekeeper

31233
08:25:41,900 --> 08:25:43,100
coming towards them.

31234
08:25:43,200 --> 08:25:43,440
And.

31235
08:25:43,440 --> 08:25:44,060
Concluding that

31236
08:25:44,060 --> 08:25:44,900
she came to call them

31237
08:25:44,900 --> 08:25:45,740
to their mother,

31238
08:25:45,740 --> 08:25:46,380
went forward

31239
08:25:46,380 --> 08:25:47,360
to meet her.

31240
08:25:47,360 --> 08:25:48,020
But instead of

31241
08:25:48,020 --> 08:25:49,200
the expected summons

31242
08:25:49,200 --> 08:25:49,440
when they

31243
08:25:49,440 --> 08:25:50,280
approached her,

31244
08:25:50,280 --> 08:25:50,820
she said to

31245
08:25:50,820 --> 08:25:52,020
Miss Bennett.

31246
08:25:52,280 --> 08:25:52,860
I beg your.

31247
08:25:52,860 --> 08:25:53,580
Pardon, madam,

31248
08:25:53,580 --> 08:25:54,620
for interrupting you,

31249
08:25:54,620 --> 08:25:55,400
but I was in hopes

31250
08:25:55,400 --> 08:25:55,940
that you might have had

31251
08:25:55,940 --> 08:25:56,600
some good news

31252
08:25:56,600 --> 08:25:57,420
from town.

31253
08:25:57,420 --> 08:25:58,260
So I took the liberty

31254
08:25:58,260 --> 08:25:59,460
of coming to ask,

31255
08:25:59,840 --> 08:26:01,040
What do you mean?

31256
08:26:01,080 --> 08:26:02,340
We've nothing from town,

31257
08:26:03,140 --> 08:26:04,260
Dear Madam.

31258
08:26:04,260 --> 08:26:04,880
Cried Mrs.

31259
08:26:04,880 --> 08:26:05,240
Hale in

31260
08:26:05,240 --> 08:26:06,440
great astonishment.

31261
08:26:06,500 --> 08:26:07,040
Don't you know

31262
08:26:07,040 --> 08:26:07,700
there is an express

31263
08:26:07,700 --> 08:26:08,640
come for Master of Mr.

31264
08:26:08,640 --> 08:26:09,440
Gardner?

31265
08:26:09,440 --> 08:26:10,080
He's been here

31266
08:26:10,080 --> 08:26:10,920
this half hour

31267
08:26:10,920 --> 08:26:11,480
and Master

31268
08:26:11,480 --> 08:26:12,680
has had a letter.

31269
08:26:12,920 --> 08:26:14,160
A way round the girls

31270
08:26:14,340 --> 08:26:15,380
too eager to get in,

31271
08:26:15,380 --> 08:26:16,580
to have time for speech.

31272
08:26:16,760 --> 08:26:17,360
They ran through

31273
08:26:17,360 --> 08:26:17,940
the vestibule

31274
08:26:17,940 --> 08:26:19,080
into the breakfast room

31275
08:26:19,080 --> 08:26:19,620
from thence

31276
08:26:19,620 --> 08:26:20,600
to the library.

31277
08:26:20,600 --> 08:26:21,140
Their father

31278
08:26:21,140 --> 08:26:22,020
was in neither,

31279
08:26:22,020 --> 08:26:22,460
and they were

31280
08:26:22,460 --> 08:26:22,920
on the point

31281
08:26:22,920 --> 08:26:23,940
of seeking him upstairs

31282
08:26:23,940 --> 08:26:24,740
with their mother

31283
08:26:24,740 --> 08:26:25,340
when they were met

31284
08:26:25,340 --> 08:26:26,540
by the butler, who said.

31285
08:26:27,020 --> 08:26:27,600
If you were looking

31286
08:26:27,600 --> 08:26:28,620
for my master, ma'am,

31287
08:26:28,620 --> 08:26:29,220
he is walking

31288
08:26:29,220 --> 08:26:29,540
towards the

31289
08:26:29,540 --> 08:26:30,740
little copse.

31290
08:26:30,860 --> 08:26:32,060
Upon this information.

31291
08:26:32,240 --> 08:26:33,200
They instantly passed

31292
08:26:33,200 --> 08:26:33,680
through the hall

31293
08:26:33,680 --> 08:26:34,940
once more and ran

31294
08:26:34,940 --> 08:26:35,700
across the lawn

31295
08:26:35,700 --> 08:26:36,800
after their father.

31296
08:26:36,800 --> 08:26:37,640
He was deliberately

31297
08:26:37,640 --> 08:26:38,480
pursuing his way

31298
08:26:38,480 --> 08:26:39,680
towards the small wood

31299
08:26:39,680 --> 08:26:40,380
on one side

31300
08:26:40,380 --> 08:26:41,480
of the paddock.

31301
08:26:41,480 --> 08:26:42,600
Jane, who was not.

31302
08:26:42,600 --> 08:26:43,220
So light

31303
08:26:43,220 --> 08:26:44,300
nor so much in the habit

31304
08:26:44,300 --> 08:26:45,500
of running as Elizabeth,

31305
08:26:45,560 --> 08:26:46,760
soon lagged behind

31306
08:26:46,940 --> 08:26:47,720
while her sister

31307
08:26:47,720 --> 08:26:48,780
panting for breath.

31308
08:26:48,780 --> 08:26:49,560
Came up with him.

31309
08:26:49,560 --> 08:26:50,760
And eagerly out.

31310
08:26:51,180 --> 08:26:51,780
Her papa.

31311
08:26:51,780 --> 08:26:52,440
What news?

31312
08:26:52,440 --> 08:26:53,360
What news?

31313
08:26:53,360 --> 08:26:53,900
Have you heard

31314
08:26:53,900 --> 08:26:55,100
from my uncle?

31315
08:26:55,320 --> 08:26:56,400
Yes, I've had a letter

31316
08:26:56,400 --> 08:26:57,600
from him by Express.

31317
08:26:58,640 --> 08:26:59,180
Well, and

31318
08:26:59,180 --> 08:27:00,140
what news does it bring,

31319
08:27:00,140 --> 08:27:01,340
good or bad?

31320
08:27:01,640 --> 08:27:02,240
What is there of

31321
08:27:02,240 --> 08:27:03,440
good to be expected?

31322
08:27:03,660 --> 08:27:04,320
Said he,

31323
08:27:04,320 --> 08:27:05,100
taking the letter

31324
08:27:05,100 --> 08:27:06,300
from his pocket.

31325
08:27:06,480 --> 08:27:07,020
But perhaps

31326
08:27:07,020 --> 08:27:07,440
you would like

31327
08:27:07,440 --> 08:27:08,640
to read it.

31328
08:27:08,660 --> 08:27:09,740
Elizabeth impatiently

31329
08:27:09,740 --> 08:27:10,940
caught it from his hand.

31330
08:27:10,980 --> 08:27:12,180
Jane now came up.

31331
08:27:12,720 --> 08:27:13,760
Read it aloud.

31332
08:27:13,760 --> 08:27:14,960
Said their father.

31333
08:27:15,060 --> 08:27:16,200
For I hardly know myself

31334
08:27:16,200 --> 08:27:17,400
what it is about.

31335
08:27:18,140 --> 08:27:19,080
Grace Church Street,

31336
08:27:19,080 --> 08:27:20,480
Monday, August 2nd.

31337
08:27:20,840 --> 08:27:21,380
My dear

31338
08:27:21,380 --> 08:27:22,880
brother, at last,

31339
08:27:22,880 --> 08:27:23,880
I am able to send you

31340
08:27:23,880 --> 08:27:25,080
some tidings of my niece

31341
08:27:25,320 --> 08:27:26,340
and such as upon

31342
08:27:26,340 --> 08:27:26,820
the whole.

31343
08:27:26,820 --> 08:27:27,180
I hope

31344
08:27:27,180 --> 08:27:27,500
it will give

31345
08:27:27,500 --> 08:27:28,700
you satisfaction.

31346
08:27:28,740 --> 08:27:29,480
Soon after you

31347
08:27:29,480 --> 08:27:30,500
left me on Saturday,

31348
08:27:30,500 --> 08:27:31,500
I was fortunate enough

31349
08:27:31,500 --> 08:27:32,180
to find out in

31350
08:27:32,180 --> 08:27:33,060
what part of London

31351
08:27:33,060 --> 08:27:33,840
they were.

31352
08:27:33,840 --> 08:27:35,060
The particulars I was of

31353
08:27:35,060 --> 08:27:35,760
Till we meet.

31354
08:27:35,760 --> 08:27:36,620
It is enough to know

31355
08:27:36,620 --> 08:27:37,640
they are discovered.

31356
08:27:37,640 --> 08:27:38,840
I have seen them both.

31357
08:27:39,420 --> 08:27:39,840
Then it is

31358
08:27:39,840 --> 08:27:41,060
as I always hoped.

31359
08:27:41,300 --> 08:27:42,200
Cried Jane.

31360
08:27:42,200 --> 08:27:43,400
They are married.

31361
08:27:43,820 --> 08:27:44,400
Elizabeth.

31362
08:27:44,400 --> 08:27:45,440
Read on.

31363
08:27:45,440 --> 08:27:46,640
I have seen them both.

31364
08:27:46,760 --> 08:27:47,880
They are not married.

31365
08:27:47,880 --> 08:27:48,680
Nor can I find

31366
08:27:48,680 --> 08:27:49,080
there was any

31367
08:27:49,080 --> 08:27:50,280
intention of being so.

31368
08:27:50,520 --> 08:27:51,440
But if you are willing

31369
08:27:51,440 --> 08:27:51,860
to perform

31370
08:27:51,860 --> 08:27:52,560
the engagements

31371
08:27:52,560 --> 08:27:53,180
which I have ventured

31372
08:27:53,180 --> 08:27:54,380
to make on your side,

31373
08:27:54,380 --> 08:27:54,960
I hope it will

31374
08:27:54,960 --> 08:27:55,620
not be long

31375
08:27:55,620 --> 08:27:56,640
before they are.

31376
08:27:56,640 --> 08:27:57,600
All that is required

31377
08:27:57,600 --> 08:27:58,820
of you is to assure

31378
08:27:58,820 --> 08:27:59,600
to your daughter

31379
08:27:59,600 --> 08:28:01,080
by settlement her equal

31380
08:28:01,080 --> 08:28:02,760
share of the ?5,000

31381
08:28:02,760 --> 08:28:03,260
secured

31382
08:28:03,260 --> 08:28:04,160
among your children

31383
08:28:04,160 --> 08:28:04,920
after the decease

31384
08:28:04,920 --> 08:28:05,420
of yourself

31385
08:28:05,420 --> 08:28:06,500
and my sister.

31386
08:28:06,500 --> 08:28:07,620
And moreover, to enter.

31387
08:28:07,620 --> 08:28:08,360
Into an agreement of.

31388
08:28:08,360 --> 08:28:10,040
Allowing during her life

31389
08:28:10,260 --> 08:28:11,700
?100 per annum.

31390
08:28:12,180 --> 08:28:13,100
These are conditions

31391
08:28:13,100 --> 08:28:13,940
which considering

31392
08:28:13,940 --> 08:28:14,520
everything.

31393
08:28:14,520 --> 08:28:15,620
I had no hesitation

31394
08:28:15,620 --> 08:28:16,620
in complying with

31395
08:28:16,620 --> 08:28:17,120
as far as

31396
08:28:17,120 --> 08:28:17,700
I thought myself.

31397
08:28:17,700 --> 08:28:18,900
Privileged for.

31398
08:28:19,100 --> 08:28:19,880
I shall send this

31399
08:28:19,880 --> 08:28:21,480
by express that no time

31400
08:28:21,480 --> 08:28:21,980
may be lost

31401
08:28:21,980 --> 08:28:22,440
in bringing me

31402
08:28:22,440 --> 08:28:23,280
your answer.

31403
08:28:23,280 --> 08:28:23,580
You will

31404
08:28:23,580 --> 08:28:24,500
easily comprehend

31405
08:28:24,500 --> 08:28:25,560
from these particulars

31406
08:28:25,560 --> 08:28:26,000
that Mr.

31407
08:28:26,000 --> 08:28:27,080
Wickham circumstances

31408
08:28:27,080 --> 08:28:27,920
are not so hopeless

31409
08:28:27,920 --> 08:28:28,220
as they had

31410
08:28:28,220 --> 08:28:28,820
generally believed

31411
08:28:28,820 --> 08:28:29,600
to be.

31412
08:28:29,600 --> 08:28:30,060
The world

31413
08:28:30,060 --> 08:28:30,740
has been deceived

31414
08:28:30,740 --> 08:28:31,640
in that respect,

31415
08:28:31,640 --> 08:28:32,720
and I am happy to say

31416
08:28:32,720 --> 08:28:33,060
there would be

31417
08:28:33,060 --> 08:28:33,960
some little money.

31418
08:28:33,960 --> 08:28:34,920
Even when all his debts

31419
08:28:34,920 --> 08:28:35,720
are discharged.

31420
08:28:35,720 --> 08:28:36,900
To settle on my niece,

31421
08:28:36,900 --> 08:28:37,400
in addition

31422
08:28:37,400 --> 08:28:38,600
to her own fortune,

31423
08:28:38,840 --> 08:28:39,680
if, as I conclude,

31424
08:28:39,680 --> 08:28:40,500
will be the case,

31425
08:28:40,500 --> 08:28:41,700
you send me full powers

31426
08:28:41,700 --> 08:28:42,560
to act in your name

31427
08:28:42,560 --> 08:28:43,100
throughout the whole

31428
08:28:43,100 --> 08:28:44,040
of this business.

31429
08:28:44,040 --> 08:28:44,720
I will immediately

31430
08:28:44,720 --> 08:28:45,380
give directions

31431
08:28:45,380 --> 08:28:45,960
to Harrison

31432
08:28:45,960 --> 08:28:46,460
for preparing

31433
08:28:46,460 --> 08:28:47,600
a proper settlement.

31434
08:28:47,600 --> 08:28:48,240
There will not be

31435
08:28:48,240 --> 08:28:49,080
smallest occasion

31436
08:28:49,080 --> 08:28:49,580
for your coming

31437
08:28:49,580 --> 08:28:50,520
to town again.

31438
08:28:50,520 --> 08:28:51,020
Therefore,

31439
08:28:51,020 --> 08:28:51,600
stay quiet

31440
08:28:51,600 --> 08:28:52,320
at Long Bourne

31441
08:28:52,320 --> 08:28:52,860
and depend

31442
08:28:52,860 --> 08:28:53,580
on my diligence

31443
08:28:53,580 --> 08:28:54,480
and care.

31444
08:28:54,480 --> 08:28:55,500
Send back your answer

31445
08:28:55,500 --> 08:28:56,460
as fast as you can

31446
08:28:56,460 --> 08:28:57,020
and be careful

31447
08:28:57,020 --> 08:28:58,220
to write explicitly.

31448
08:28:58,440 --> 08:28:59,420
We have judged it's best

31449
08:28:59,420 --> 08:28:59,880
that my niece

31450
08:28:59,880 --> 08:29:00,360
should be married

31451
08:29:00,360 --> 08:29:01,200
from this house

31452
08:29:01,200 --> 08:29:01,520
of which

31453
08:29:01,520 --> 08:29:02,720
I hope you will approve.

31454
08:29:02,780 --> 08:29:03,980
She comes to us today.

31455
08:29:03,980 --> 08:29:04,860
I shall write again

31456
08:29:04,860 --> 08:29:05,640
as soon as anything more

31457
08:29:05,640 --> 08:29:06,660
is determined on

31458
08:29:06,660 --> 08:29:07,700
yours, etc..

31459
08:29:07,700 --> 08:29:08,040
Edward.

31460
08:29:09,420 --> 08:29:10,620
Is it possible?

31461
08:29:10,860 --> 08:29:11,600
Cried Elizabeth

31462
08:29:11,600 --> 08:29:12,800
when she had finished.

31463
08:29:12,900 --> 08:29:13,940
Can it be possible

31464
08:29:13,940 --> 08:29:15,140
that he will marry her?

31465
08:29:15,720 --> 08:29:16,460
Wickham is not

31466
08:29:16,460 --> 08:29:17,100
so undeserving

31467
08:29:17,100 --> 08:29:18,300
that as we thought him.

31468
08:29:18,380 --> 08:29:19,560
Said her sister.

31469
08:29:19,560 --> 08:29:20,580
My dear father,

31470
08:29:20,580 --> 08:29:21,780
I congratulate you.

31471
08:29:22,440 --> 08:29:23,240
And have you answered

31472
08:29:23,240 --> 08:29:24,060
the letter?

31473
08:29:24,060 --> 08:29:25,080
Cried Elizabeth.

31474
08:29:25,080 --> 08:29:26,480
No, but it must be done

31475
08:29:26,480 --> 08:29:27,680
soon,

31476
08:29:27,860 --> 08:29:28,700
most earnestly.

31477
08:29:28,700 --> 08:29:29,220
Did she then

31478
08:29:29,220 --> 08:29:30,140
and treat him to lose

31479
08:29:30,140 --> 08:29:30,780
no more time

31480
08:29:30,780 --> 08:29:31,980
before he wrote.

31481
08:29:32,300 --> 08:29:33,000
Oh, my dear

31482
08:29:33,000 --> 08:29:34,440
father, she cried.

31483
08:29:34,700 --> 08:29:35,300
Come back

31484
08:29:35,300 --> 08:29:36,500
and write immediately.

31485
08:29:36,660 --> 08:29:37,760
Consider how important

31486
08:29:37,760 --> 08:29:38,660
every moment is

31487
08:29:38,660 --> 08:29:39,860
in such a case.

31488
08:29:40,200 --> 08:29:40,860
Let me write

31489
08:29:40,860 --> 08:29:42,200
for you, said Jane.

31490
08:29:42,380 --> 08:29:42,960
If you dislike

31491
08:29:42,960 --> 08:29:43,980
the trouble yourself.

31492
08:29:43,980 --> 08:29:45,320
I dislike it very much,

31493
08:29:45,420 --> 08:29:46,080
he replied.

31494
08:29:46,080 --> 08:29:47,280
But it must be done.

31495
08:29:47,340 --> 08:29:48,260
And so saying

31496
08:29:48,260 --> 08:29:49,260
he turned back with them

31497
08:29:49,260 --> 08:29:49,700
and walked

31498
08:29:49,700 --> 08:29:50,900
towards the house.

31499
08:29:51,440 --> 08:29:52,640
And may I ask?

31500
08:29:52,980 --> 08:29:54,180
Asked Elizabeth.

31501
08:29:54,260 --> 08:29:55,040
But the terms,

31502
08:29:55,040 --> 08:29:55,580
I suppose,

31503
08:29:55,580 --> 08:29:56,780
must be complied with.

31504
08:29:57,200 --> 08:29:58,380
Complied with.

31505
08:29:58,380 --> 08:29:59,360
I'm only ashamed of his

31506
08:29:59,360 --> 08:30:00,380
asking so little.

31507
08:30:01,400 --> 08:30:01,760
And they

31508
08:30:01,760 --> 08:30:02,960
must marry.

31509
08:30:02,960 --> 08:30:04,380
Yet he is such a man.

31510
08:30:04,740 --> 08:30:05,540
Yes. Yes.

31511
08:30:05,540 --> 08:30:06,320
They must marry.

31512
08:30:06,320 --> 08:30:06,620
There

31513
08:30:06,620 --> 08:30:07,860
nothing else to be done.

31514
08:30:07,940 --> 08:30:08,960
But there are two things

31515
08:30:08,960 --> 08:30:09,440
that I want

31516
08:30:09,440 --> 08:30:10,640
very much to know.

31517
08:30:10,680 --> 08:30:12,320
One is how much money

31518
08:30:12,320 --> 08:30:13,920
your uncle has laid down

31519
08:30:13,920 --> 08:30:14,960
to bring it about.

31520
08:30:14,960 --> 08:30:15,980
And the other how

31521
08:30:15,980 --> 08:30:17,420
I am to pay him

31522
08:30:17,720 --> 08:30:18,680
money.

31523
08:30:18,680 --> 08:30:20,540
My uncle cried Jane.

31524
08:30:20,820 --> 08:30:22,020
What do you mean, sir?

31525
08:30:22,280 --> 08:30:23,280
I mean that no man

31526
08:30:23,280 --> 08:30:24,480
in his proper senses

31527
08:30:24,600 --> 08:30:25,700
would marry Lydia on

31528
08:30:25,700 --> 08:30:27,140
so a temptation

31529
08:30:27,300 --> 08:30:28,400
as 100 a year

31530
08:30:28,400 --> 08:30:30,360
during my life and 50

31531
08:30:30,360 --> 08:30:31,560
after I'm gone.

31532
08:30:31,560 --> 08:30:32,760
That is very true.

31533
08:30:32,820 --> 08:30:33,960
Said Elizabeth.

31534
08:30:33,960 --> 08:30:34,160
Though

31535
08:30:34,160 --> 08:30:34,520
it hadn't

31536
08:30:34,520 --> 08:30:35,720
occurred to me before

31537
08:30:35,880 --> 08:30:36,500
his debts

31538
08:30:36,500 --> 08:30:37,380
to be discharged

31539
08:30:37,380 --> 08:30:37,900
and something

31540
08:30:37,900 --> 08:30:39,100
still to remain.

31541
08:30:39,360 --> 08:30:39,600
How?

31542
08:30:39,600 --> 08:30:40,220
It must be

31543
08:30:40,220 --> 08:30:41,420
my uncle's doings.

31544
08:30:41,540 --> 08:30:42,180
Generous.

31545
08:30:42,180 --> 08:30:42,920
Good man.

31546
08:30:42,920 --> 08:30:43,580
I am afraid

31547
08:30:43,580 --> 08:30:44,360
he has distressed

31548
08:30:44,360 --> 08:30:45,240
himself.

31549
08:30:45,240 --> 08:30:45,720
A small

31550
08:30:45,720 --> 08:30:46,160
sum could

31551
08:30:46,160 --> 08:30:47,360
not do all this.

31552
08:30:47,600 --> 08:30:48,980
No, said her father.

31553
08:30:49,220 --> 08:30:50,040
Becomes a fool

31554
08:30:50,040 --> 08:30:50,580
if he takes it

31555
08:30:50,580 --> 08:30:51,260
with a farthing.

31556
08:30:51,260 --> 08:30:52,880
Less than ?10,000.

31557
08:30:53,100 --> 08:30:53,820
I should be sorry

31558
08:30:53,820 --> 08:30:54,420
to think so.

31559
08:30:54,420 --> 08:30:55,160
Ill of him

31560
08:30:55,160 --> 08:30:56,000
in the very beginning

31561
08:30:56,000 --> 08:30:57,200
of our relationship.

31562
08:30:57,680 --> 08:30:59,180
?10,000.

31563
08:30:59,580 --> 08:31:00,780
Heaven forbid.

31564
08:31:00,900 --> 08:31:01,940
How is half such a sum

31565
08:31:01,940 --> 08:31:03,140
to be repaid?

31566
08:31:03,380 --> 08:31:03,740
Mr.

31567
08:31:03,740 --> 08:31:04,940
Bennett made no answer,

31568
08:31:05,100 --> 08:31:06,200
and each of them, deep

31569
08:31:06,200 --> 08:31:06,900
in thought,

31570
08:31:06,900 --> 08:31:07,860
continued silence

31571
08:31:07,860 --> 08:31:08,340
till they reached

31572
08:31:08,340 --> 08:31:09,140
the house.

31573
08:31:09,140 --> 08:31:09,720
Their father

31574
08:31:09,720 --> 08:31:10,380
then went on to

31575
08:31:10,380 --> 08:31:11,540
the library to. Walk.

31576
08:31:11,540 --> 08:31:12,480
And the girls walked

31577
08:31:12,480 --> 08:31:13,680
into the breakfast room.

31578
08:31:14,360 --> 08:31:15,240
And they are really

31579
08:31:15,240 --> 08:31:16,260
to be married.

31580
08:31:16,260 --> 08:31:17,060
Cried Elizabeth,

31581
08:31:17,060 --> 08:31:17,660
as soon as they were

31582
08:31:17,660 --> 08:31:18,860
by themselves.

31583
08:31:18,920 --> 08:31:20,180
How strange this is.

31584
08:31:20,520 --> 08:31:21,320
And for this

31585
08:31:21,320 --> 08:31:22,520
we ought to be thankful

31586
08:31:22,680 --> 08:31:23,880
that they should marry

31587
08:31:23,940 --> 08:31:24,660
small, as

31588
08:31:24,660 --> 08:31:25,320
is their chance

31589
08:31:25,320 --> 08:31:26,040
of happiness.

31590
08:31:26,040 --> 08:31:26,940
And wretched, as

31591
08:31:26,940 --> 08:31:27,920
is his character.

31592
08:31:27,920 --> 08:31:28,700
We are forced

31593
08:31:28,700 --> 08:31:29,840
to rejoice.

31594
08:31:29,840 --> 08:31:31,040
How, Lydia?

31595
08:31:31,400 --> 08:31:32,420
I comfort myself for.

31596
08:31:32,420 --> 08:31:34,140
Thinking, replied Jane.

31597
08:31:34,460 --> 08:31:35,180
That he certainly

31598
08:31:35,180 --> 08:31:36,180
would not marry Lydia

31599
08:31:36,180 --> 08:31:36,620
if he had not a

31600
08:31:36,620 --> 08:31:37,820
real regard for her.

31601
08:31:38,120 --> 08:31:38,900
Though our kind

31602
08:31:38,900 --> 08:31:39,480
uncle has done

31603
08:31:39,480 --> 08:31:40,220
something towards

31604
08:31:40,220 --> 08:31:41,120
clearing him.

31605
08:31:41,120 --> 08:31:42,140
I cannot believe that

31606
08:31:42,140 --> 08:31:43,500
?10,000 or.

31607
08:31:43,500 --> 08:31:44,100
Anything like.

31608
08:31:44,100 --> 08:31:45,420
It has been advanced.

31609
08:31:45,500 --> 08:31:46,280
He has children

31610
08:31:46,280 --> 08:31:46,940
of his own

31611
08:31:46,940 --> 08:31:48,140
and may have more.

31612
08:31:48,440 --> 08:31:48,900
How could he

31613
08:31:48,900 --> 08:31:50,720
spare half ?10,000

31614
08:31:51,540 --> 08:31:52,460
if he were ever able

31615
08:31:52,460 --> 08:31:53,660
to learn what Wickham's

31616
08:31:53,760 --> 08:31:54,480
of being

31617
08:31:54,480 --> 08:31:55,680
said, Elizabeth, and

31618
08:31:55,680 --> 08:31:56,600
how much is settled

31619
08:31:56,600 --> 08:31:57,240
on his side

31620
08:31:57,240 --> 08:31:58,220
on our sister?

31621
08:31:58,220 --> 08:31:58,620
We shall.

31622
08:31:58,620 --> 08:31:59,160
Exactly.

31623
08:31:59,160 --> 08:32:00,020
Know what Mr.

31624
08:32:00,020 --> 08:32:00,780
Gardner has done

31625
08:32:00,780 --> 08:32:02,160
for them because Wickham

31626
08:32:02,160 --> 08:32:02,480
has not

31627
08:32:02,480 --> 08:32:03,680
a sixpence of his own.

31628
08:32:04,080 --> 08:32:05,240
The kindness in my uncle

31629
08:32:05,240 --> 08:32:05,640
and aunt

31630
08:32:05,640 --> 08:32:06,840
can never be requited.

31631
08:32:07,200 --> 08:32:08,400
Their taking her home

31632
08:32:08,580 --> 08:32:09,320
and affording her

31633
08:32:09,320 --> 08:32:09,980
their personal

31634
08:32:09,980 --> 08:32:10,560
protection

31635
08:32:10,560 --> 08:32:11,540
and countenance

31636
08:32:11,540 --> 08:32:12,780
is such a sacrifice.

31637
08:32:12,840 --> 08:32:13,580
Her advantage

31638
08:32:13,580 --> 08:32:14,820
as years of gratitude

31639
08:32:14,820 --> 08:32:15,440
cannot enough

31640
08:32:15,440 --> 08:32:16,500
acknowledge.

31641
08:32:16,500 --> 08:32:17,180
By this time

31642
08:32:17,180 --> 08:32:17,480
she is

31643
08:32:17,480 --> 08:32:18,680
actually with them.

31644
08:32:19,140 --> 08:32:20,180
If such goodness does

31645
08:32:20,180 --> 08:32:20,600
not make a

31646
08:32:20,600 --> 08:32:21,500
miserable now,

31647
08:32:21,500 --> 08:32:22,100
she will never

31648
08:32:22,100 --> 08:32:23,300
deserve to be happy.

31649
08:32:23,600 --> 08:32:24,920
What a meeting for her.

31650
08:32:25,100 --> 08:32:25,400
When she

31651
08:32:25,400 --> 08:32:26,760
first sees my aunt.

31652
08:32:27,740 --> 08:32:28,460
We must endeavor

31653
08:32:28,460 --> 08:32:28,920
to forget

31654
08:32:28,920 --> 08:32:29,760
all that is passed

31655
08:32:29,760 --> 08:32:30,060
on either

31656
08:32:30,060 --> 08:32:31,460
side, said Jane.

31657
08:32:31,820 --> 08:32:32,900
I hope and trust

31658
08:32:32,900 --> 08:32:34,100
will yet be happy.

31659
08:32:34,460 --> 08:32:35,640
His consenting to marry

31660
08:32:35,640 --> 08:32:36,360
her is a proof.

31661
08:32:36,360 --> 08:32:37,200
I will believe

31662
08:32:37,200 --> 08:32:38,000
that he has come to a

31663
08:32:38,000 --> 08:32:39,200
right way of thinking.

31664
08:32:39,440 --> 08:32:40,520
That mutual affection

31665
08:32:40,520 --> 08:32:41,600
will study them.

31666
08:32:41,600 --> 08:32:42,720
And I flatter myself,

31667
08:32:42,720 --> 08:32:43,920
will settle so quietly

31668
08:32:44,100 --> 08:32:45,260
and leave in so rational

31669
08:32:45,260 --> 08:32:46,560
a manner as may in.

31670
08:32:46,560 --> 08:32:47,540
Time make their past.

31671
08:32:47,540 --> 08:32:48,740
Imprudence forgotten.

31672
08:32:48,980 --> 08:32:50,300
That conduct has been.

31673
08:32:50,300 --> 08:32:51,960
Such, replied Elizabeth.

31674
08:32:52,320 --> 08:32:53,280
As neither you

31675
08:32:53,280 --> 08:32:54,540
nor I nor anybody.

31676
08:32:54,540 --> 08:32:55,620
Can ever. Forget.

31677
08:32:55,620 --> 08:32:56,480
It is useless

31678
08:32:56,480 --> 08:32:57,680
to talk of it.

31679
08:32:57,960 --> 08:32:58,380
It now

31680
08:32:58,380 --> 08:32:59,240
occurred to the girls

31681
08:32:59,240 --> 08:32:59,820
that their mother

31682
08:32:59,820 --> 08:33:00,860
was in all likelihood

31683
08:33:00,860 --> 08:33:01,820
perfectly ignorant

31684
08:33:01,820 --> 08:33:03,020
of what had happened.

31685
08:33:03,060 --> 08:33:03,600
They went to

31686
08:33:03,600 --> 08:33:04,800
the library, therefore,

31687
08:33:04,920 --> 08:33:06,060
and asked their father

31688
08:33:06,060 --> 08:33:06,780
whether he would not

31689
08:33:06,780 --> 08:33:07,260
wish them

31690
08:33:07,260 --> 08:33:08,460
to make it known to her.

31691
08:33:08,640 --> 08:33:09,480
He was writing

31692
08:33:09,480 --> 08:33:10,280
and without raising

31693
08:33:10,280 --> 08:33:10,920
his head.

31694
08:33:10,920 --> 08:33:12,120
Coolly replied.

31695
08:33:12,300 --> 08:33:13,500
Just as you please.

31696
08:33:14,000 --> 08:33:15,120
May we take my uncle's

31697
08:33:15,120 --> 08:33:16,320
letter to read to her?

31698
08:33:16,460 --> 08:33:17,660
Take whatever you like

31699
08:33:17,660 --> 08:33:18,440
and get away.

31700
08:33:19,440 --> 08:33:20,160
Elizabeth took

31701
08:33:20,160 --> 08:33:20,520
the letter

31702
08:33:20,520 --> 08:33:21,620
from his writing table,

31703
08:33:21,620 --> 08:33:22,200
and they went

31704
08:33:22,200 --> 08:33:23,400
upstairs together.

31705
08:33:23,660 --> 08:33:24,620
Mary and Kitty

31706
08:33:24,620 --> 08:33:25,340
were both with Mrs.

31707
08:33:25,340 --> 08:33:26,000
Bennett.

31708
08:33:26,000 --> 08:33:27,020
One communication

31709
08:33:27,020 --> 08:33:27,740
would therefore

31710
08:33:27,740 --> 08:33:28,800
do for all.

31711
08:33:28,800 --> 08:33:29,240
After a

31712
08:33:29,240 --> 08:33:30,200
slight preparation

31713
08:33:30,200 --> 08:33:31,200
for good news,

31714
08:33:31,200 --> 08:33:32,000
the letter was read

31715
08:33:32,000 --> 08:33:32,820
aloud.

31716
08:33:32,820 --> 08:33:33,240
Mrs.

31717
08:33:33,240 --> 08:33:34,160
Bennett could hardly

31718
08:33:34,160 --> 08:33:35,360
contain herself.

31719
08:33:35,400 --> 08:33:36,300
As soon as Jane

31720
08:33:36,300 --> 08:33:36,920
had read Mr.

31721
08:33:36,920 --> 08:33:37,400
Gardner's

31722
08:33:37,400 --> 08:33:38,100
hope of Lydia's

31723
08:33:38,100 --> 08:33:39,260
being soon married.

31724
08:33:39,260 --> 08:33:40,560
Her joy burst forth,

31725
08:33:40,680 --> 08:33:41,300
and every

31726
08:33:41,300 --> 08:33:42,240
following sentence

31727
08:33:42,240 --> 08:33:43,560
added to its exuberance.

31728
08:33:43,880 --> 08:33:44,600
She was now in

31729
08:33:44,600 --> 08:33:45,440
an irritation

31730
08:33:45,440 --> 08:33:46,740
as violent from delight

31731
08:33:46,740 --> 08:33:47,360
as she'd ever

31732
08:33:47,360 --> 08:33:48,060
been, fidgety

31733
08:33:48,060 --> 08:33:49,280
from alarm and vexation.

31734
08:33:49,680 --> 08:33:50,100
To know

31735
08:33:50,100 --> 08:33:50,300
that her

31736
08:33:50,300 --> 08:33:50,880
daughter would be.

31737
08:33:50,880 --> 08:33:52,080
Married was enough.

31738
08:33:52,080 --> 08:33:53,340
She was disturbed by no

31739
08:33:53,340 --> 08:33:54,540
fear for her Felicity,

31740
08:33:54,660 --> 08:33:55,400
nor humbled by

31741
08:33:55,400 --> 08:33:56,180
any remembrance

31742
08:33:56,180 --> 08:33:57,380
of her misconduct.

31743
08:33:57,740 --> 08:33:59,160
My dear, dear

31744
08:33:59,160 --> 08:34:00,800
Lydia, she cried.

31745
08:34:01,080 --> 08:34:02,160
This is delightful

31746
08:34:02,160 --> 08:34:03,060
indeed.

31747
08:34:03,060 --> 08:34:04,260
She will be married.

31748
08:34:04,260 --> 08:34:05,460
I shall see her again.

31749
08:34:05,540 --> 08:34:06,480
She will be married

31750
08:34:06,480 --> 08:34:07,700
at 16.

31751
08:34:08,060 --> 08:34:10,080
My good kind brother.

31752
08:34:10,340 --> 08:34:11,420
I knew how it would be.

31753
08:34:11,420 --> 08:34:12,020
I knew he would

31754
08:34:12,020 --> 08:34:13,080
manage everything.

31755
08:34:13,080 --> 08:34:14,280
How I loved to see her.

31756
08:34:14,360 --> 08:34:15,060
And to see Dear

31757
08:34:15,060 --> 08:34:16,260
Wickham, too.

31758
08:34:16,340 --> 08:34:17,400
Oh, but the clothes,

31759
08:34:17,400 --> 08:34:18,600
The wedding clothes.

31760
08:34:18,660 --> 08:34:19,080
I will write

31761
08:34:19,080 --> 08:34:19,560
to my sister

31762
08:34:19,560 --> 08:34:20,760
Gardner them directly.

31763
08:34:21,060 --> 08:34:22,100
Lizzie, my dear,

31764
08:34:22,100 --> 08:34:23,180
run down to your father

31765
08:34:23,180 --> 08:34:23,640
and ask him

31766
08:34:23,640 --> 08:34:24,140
how much

31767
08:34:24,140 --> 08:34:25,140
he will give her.

31768
08:34:25,140 --> 08:34:25,680
Stay. Stay.

31769
08:34:25,680 --> 08:34:26,600
I will go myself.

31770
08:34:26,600 --> 08:34:27,480
Ring the bell, Katie.

31771
08:34:27,480 --> 08:34:28,080
For Hill.

31772
08:34:28,080 --> 08:34:28,980
I will put on my things

31773
08:34:28,980 --> 08:34:29,840
in a moment.

31774
08:34:29,840 --> 08:34:31,200
My dear, dear Lydia,

31775
08:34:31,320 --> 08:34:31,980
how merry

31776
08:34:31,980 --> 08:34:32,660
we shall be together

31777
08:34:32,660 --> 08:34:33,860
when we meet.

31778
08:34:33,900 --> 08:34:34,920
Her eldest daughter

31779
08:34:34,920 --> 08:34:35,540
endeavored to give

31780
08:34:35,540 --> 08:34:36,120
some relief

31781
08:34:36,120 --> 08:34:36,800
to the violence

31782
08:34:36,800 --> 08:34:37,940
of these transports

31783
08:34:37,940 --> 08:34:38,840
by leading her thoughts

31784
08:34:38,840 --> 08:34:40,260
to the which Mr.

31785
08:34:40,260 --> 08:34:41,240
Gardner's behavior

31786
08:34:41,240 --> 08:34:42,440
laid them all under.

31787
08:34:42,800 --> 08:34:43,940
Well, we must attribute

31788
08:34:43,940 --> 08:34:45,360
this happy conclusion,

31789
08:34:45,500 --> 08:34:46,380
she added,

31790
08:34:46,380 --> 08:34:47,340
in a great measure

31791
08:34:47,340 --> 08:34:48,540
to his kindness.

31792
08:34:48,540 --> 08:34:48,860
We are.

31793
08:34:48,860 --> 08:34:49,500
Persuaded that

31794
08:34:49,500 --> 08:34:50,400
he has pledged himself.

31795
08:34:50,400 --> 08:34:51,020
To assist Mr.

31796
08:34:51,020 --> 08:34:52,220
Wickham with money.

31797
08:34:52,620 --> 08:34:53,600
Well,

31798
08:34:53,600 --> 08:34:54,620
cried her mother.

31799
08:34:54,620 --> 08:34:55,820
It is all very right.

31800
08:34:55,940 --> 08:34:56,580
You should do it.

31801
08:34:56,580 --> 08:34:57,660
But her own uncle.

31802
08:34:57,660 --> 08:34:58,160
If he had

31803
08:34:58,160 --> 08:34:59,360
not a family of his own,

31804
08:34:59,360 --> 08:35:00,260
I and my children

31805
08:35:00,260 --> 08:35:00,560
must have

31806
08:35:00,560 --> 08:35:01,440
had all his money,

31807
08:35:01,440 --> 08:35:02,060
you know.

31808
08:35:02,060 --> 08:35:02,660
And it is the.

31809
08:35:02,660 --> 08:35:03,080
First.

31810
08:35:03,080 --> 08:35:03,720
Time we'd ever

31811
08:35:03,720 --> 08:35:04,200
had anything.

31812
08:35:04,200 --> 08:35:04,580
From him

31813
08:35:04,580 --> 08:35:05,780
except a few presents.

31814
08:35:06,000 --> 08:35:07,700
Well, I am so happy

31815
08:35:07,940 --> 08:35:08,540
in a short

31816
08:35:08,540 --> 08:35:08,880
time,

31817
08:35:08,880 --> 08:35:09,660
I shall have a daughter

31818
08:35:09,660 --> 08:35:11,240
married Mrs.

31819
08:35:11,240 --> 08:35:12,240
Wickham.

31820
08:35:12,240 --> 08:35:13,560
How well it sounds.

31821
08:35:13,820 --> 08:35:15,420
And she was only 16

31822
08:35:15,420 --> 08:35:16,620
last June.

31823
08:35:16,680 --> 08:35:17,700
My dear Jane,

31824
08:35:17,700 --> 08:35:18,860
I am in such a flutter

31825
08:35:18,860 --> 08:35:19,160
that I am

31826
08:35:19,160 --> 08:35:20,300
sure I can't write.

31827
08:35:20,300 --> 08:35:21,140
So I will dictate.

31828
08:35:21,140 --> 08:35:21,420
And you will

31829
08:35:21,420 --> 08:35:22,220
write for me.

31830
08:35:22,220 --> 08:35:22,740
We will settle

31831
08:35:22,740 --> 08:35:23,300
with your father

31832
08:35:23,300 --> 08:35:23,720
about the money

31833
08:35:23,720 --> 08:35:24,320
afterwards.

31834
08:35:24,320 --> 08:35:24,840
But the thing

31835
08:35:24,840 --> 08:35:25,460
should be ordered

31836
08:35:25,460 --> 08:35:26,660
immediately.

31837
08:35:27,200 --> 08:35:28,200
She was then proceeding

31838
08:35:28,200 --> 08:35:29,120
to all the particulars

31839
08:35:29,120 --> 08:35:29,780
of Calico

31840
08:35:29,780 --> 08:35:30,980
Muslin and Cranbrook

31841
08:35:31,200 --> 08:35:31,980
and would shortly

31842
08:35:31,980 --> 08:35:32,600
have dictated

31843
08:35:32,600 --> 08:35:33,480
some very plentiful

31844
08:35:33,480 --> 08:35:34,640
orders had not.

31845
08:35:34,640 --> 08:35:35,340
Jane, though

31846
08:35:35,340 --> 08:35:36,480
with some difficulty,

31847
08:35:36,480 --> 08:35:37,500
persuaded her to,

31848
08:35:37,500 --> 08:35:38,100
until her father

31849
08:35:38,100 --> 08:35:38,700
was at leisure

31850
08:35:38,700 --> 08:35:39,900
to be consulted.

31851
08:35:39,900 --> 08:35:40,940
One day's delay,

31852
08:35:40,940 --> 08:35:41,520
she observed,

31853
08:35:41,520 --> 08:35:41,840
would be of

31854
08:35:41,840 --> 08:35:43,040
small importance,

31855
08:35:43,040 --> 08:35:43,640
and her mother

31856
08:35:43,640 --> 08:35:44,360
was too happy

31857
08:35:44,360 --> 08:35:44,880
to be quite

31858
08:35:44,880 --> 08:35:46,220
so obstinate as usual.

31859
08:35:46,620 --> 08:35:47,660
Other, too,

31860
08:35:47,660 --> 08:35:48,860
came into her head.

31861
08:35:49,040 --> 08:35:50,240
I will go to Meriton,

31862
08:35:50,340 --> 08:35:51,060
said she,

31863
08:35:51,060 --> 08:35:52,260
as soon as I am dressed

31864
08:35:52,280 --> 08:35:53,100
until the good,

31865
08:35:53,100 --> 08:35:53,580
good news

31866
08:35:53,580 --> 08:35:54,780
to my sister Philips,

31867
08:35:54,780 --> 08:35:55,280
and as soon

31868
08:35:55,280 --> 08:35:56,060
as I come back

31869
08:35:56,060 --> 08:35:56,940
I can call on Lady

31870
08:35:56,940 --> 08:35:57,620
Lucas and Mrs.

31871
08:35:57,620 --> 08:35:58,620
Long Kitty,

31872
08:35:58,620 --> 08:35:59,060
run down

31873
08:35:59,060 --> 08:36:00,060
and order the carriage

31874
08:36:00,060 --> 08:36:00,980
and would do me

31875
08:36:00,980 --> 08:36:01,880
a great deal of good,

31876
08:36:01,880 --> 08:36:02,880
I am sure.

31877
08:36:02,880 --> 08:36:03,480
Girls.

31878
08:36:03,480 --> 08:36:03,900
Can I do

31879
08:36:03,900 --> 08:36:04,400
anything for you

31880
08:36:04,400 --> 08:36:05,340
in Meriton?

31881
08:36:05,340 --> 08:36:06,320
Oh, here comes Hill.

31882
08:36:06,320 --> 08:36:07,520
My dear Hill.

31883
08:36:07,560 --> 08:36:08,100
Have you heard

31884
08:36:08,100 --> 08:36:08,960
the good news?

31885
08:36:08,960 --> 08:36:09,660
Miss Lydia

31886
08:36:09,660 --> 08:36:10,700
is going to be married

31887
08:36:10,700 --> 08:36:11,640
and you shall all have

31888
08:36:11,640 --> 08:36:12,480
a bowl of punch

31889
08:36:12,480 --> 08:36:13,040
to make merry

31890
08:36:13,040 --> 08:36:13,940
at a wedding.

31891
08:36:13,940 --> 08:36:14,360
Mrs.

31892
08:36:14,360 --> 08:36:15,480
Hill began instantly

31893
08:36:15,480 --> 08:36:16,680
to express her joy.

31894
08:36:16,820 --> 08:36:17,760
Elizabeth received her

31895
08:36:17,760 --> 08:36:18,600
congratulations

31896
08:36:18,600 --> 08:36:19,520
among the rest,

31897
08:36:19,520 --> 08:36:20,700
and then sick of

31898
08:36:20,700 --> 08:36:21,440
this folly,

31899
08:36:21,440 --> 08:36:22,100
took refuge

31900
08:36:22,100 --> 08:36:23,060
in her own room

31901
08:36:23,060 --> 08:36:23,580
that she might

31902
08:36:23,580 --> 08:36:24,780
think with freedom.

31903
08:36:25,440 --> 08:36:26,060
Poor Lydia.

31904
08:36:26,060 --> 08:36:27,240
Situation must at

31905
08:36:27,240 --> 08:36:28,440
best be bad enough,

31906
08:36:28,620 --> 08:36:29,220
but that it was

31907
08:36:29,220 --> 08:36:29,900
no worse.

31908
08:36:29,900 --> 08:36:30,600
She had need

31909
08:36:30,600 --> 08:36:31,680
to be thankful

31910
08:36:31,680 --> 08:36:32,880
she felt it so.

31911
08:36:32,880 --> 08:36:33,320
And though

31912
08:36:33,320 --> 08:36:34,400
and looking forward,

31913
08:36:34,400 --> 08:36:35,180
neither rational

31914
08:36:35,180 --> 08:36:35,720
happiness

31915
08:36:35,720 --> 08:36:36,320
nor worldly

31916
08:36:36,320 --> 08:36:37,020
prosperous tea

31917
08:36:37,020 --> 08:36:38,160
could be justly expected

31918
08:36:38,160 --> 08:36:39,080
for her sister.

31919
08:36:39,080 --> 08:36:40,140
In looking back to what

31920
08:36:40,140 --> 08:36:40,820
they had feared

31921
08:36:40,820 --> 08:36:42,020
only 2 hours ago,

31922
08:36:42,200 --> 08:36:42,900
she felt all

31923
08:36:42,900 --> 08:36:44,160
the advantages of what

31924
08:36:44,160 --> 08:36:44,880
they had gained.

31925
08:36:47,060 --> 08:36:48,260
Chapter 50.

31926
08:36:49,980 --> 08:36:50,360
Mr.

31927
08:36:50,360 --> 08:36:51,620
Bennett had very often

31928
08:36:51,620 --> 08:36:52,340
wished before

31929
08:36:52,340 --> 08:36:53,600
this period of his life

31930
08:36:53,600 --> 08:36:54,860
that instead of

31931
08:36:54,860 --> 08:36:55,860
spending his whole.

31932
08:36:55,860 --> 08:36:56,720
Income.

31933
08:36:56,720 --> 08:36:58,280
He had laid by an annual

31934
08:36:58,280 --> 08:36:58,940
sum for the

31935
08:36:58,940 --> 08:36:59,760
better provision

31936
08:36:59,760 --> 08:37:00,720
of his children

31937
08:37:00,720 --> 08:37:01,920
and of his wife

31938
08:37:01,920 --> 08:37:03,140
if she survived him.

31939
08:37:03,620 --> 08:37:04,740
He now wished it.

31940
08:37:04,740 --> 08:37:05,940
More than ever.

31941
08:37:06,140 --> 08:37:07,460
Had he done his duty.

31942
08:37:07,460 --> 08:37:08,660
In that respect.

31943
08:37:08,660 --> 08:37:09,420
Lydia need.

31944
08:37:09,420 --> 08:37:09,800
Not have.

31945
08:37:09,800 --> 08:37:10,440
Been indebted

31946
08:37:10,440 --> 08:37:10,760
to her

31947
08:37:10,760 --> 08:37:11,360
uncle for

31948
08:37:11,360 --> 08:37:12,320
whatever of honor

31949
08:37:12,320 --> 08:37:13,620
or credit could now

31950
08:37:13,620 --> 08:37:14,880
be purchased for her.

31951
08:37:15,380 --> 08:37:16,380
The satisfied action

31952
08:37:16,380 --> 08:37:17,000
of prevailing

31953
08:37:17,000 --> 08:37:17,460
on one of the

31954
08:37:17,460 --> 08:37:18,300
most worthless

31955
08:37:18,300 --> 08:37:18,840
young men in

31956
08:37:18,840 --> 08:37:19,400
Great Britain

31957
08:37:19,400 --> 08:37:20,600
to be her husband

31958
08:37:20,660 --> 08:37:21,920
might then have rested

31959
08:37:21,920 --> 08:37:23,240
in its proper place.

31960
08:37:24,120 --> 08:37:25,040
He was seriously

31961
08:37:25,040 --> 08:37:25,620
concerned

31962
08:37:25,620 --> 08:37:26,220
that a cause

31963
08:37:26,220 --> 08:37:26,820
of so little

31964
08:37:26,820 --> 08:37:28,020
advantage to anyone

31965
08:37:28,220 --> 08:37:29,180
should be forwarded

31966
08:37:29,180 --> 08:37:30,240
at the sole expense

31967
08:37:30,240 --> 08:37:31,440
of his brother in law,

31968
08:37:31,580 --> 08:37:32,780
and he was determined,

31969
08:37:32,780 --> 08:37:34,580
if possible, to find out

31970
08:37:34,580 --> 08:37:35,240
the extent

31971
08:37:35,240 --> 08:37:36,320
of his assistance

31972
08:37:36,320 --> 08:37:37,460
and to discharge

31973
08:37:37,460 --> 08:37:38,280
the obligation

31974
08:37:38,280 --> 08:37:39,240
as soon as he could.

31975
08:37:40,220 --> 08:37:41,220
When first Mr.

31976
08:37:41,220 --> 08:37:42,420
Bennett had married,

31977
08:37:42,420 --> 08:37:43,520
economy was held

31978
08:37:43,520 --> 08:37:44,220
to be perfectly.

31979
08:37:44,220 --> 08:37:45,960
Useless for, of course.

31980
08:37:45,960 --> 08:37:47,160
They were to have a son.

31981
08:37:47,520 --> 08:37:48,800
The son was to join

31982
08:37:48,800 --> 08:37:49,280
in cutting

31983
08:37:49,280 --> 08:37:50,360
off the entail

31984
08:37:50,360 --> 08:37:50,840
as soon as

31985
08:37:50,840 --> 08:37:52,020
he should be of age

31986
08:37:52,020 --> 08:37:52,860
and the widow

31987
08:37:52,860 --> 08:37:53,280
and younger

31988
08:37:53,280 --> 08:37:54,080
children would by

31989
08:37:54,080 --> 08:37:55,580
that means be provided.

31990
08:37:56,660 --> 08:37:57,740
Five daughters

31991
08:37:57,740 --> 08:37:58,760
successively entered

31992
08:37:58,760 --> 08:38:00,020
the world, but yet

31993
08:38:00,020 --> 08:38:01,220
the son was to come.

31994
08:38:01,580 --> 08:38:02,180
And Mrs.

31995
08:38:02,180 --> 08:38:03,420
Bennett, for many years

31996
08:38:03,420 --> 08:38:04,620
after Lydia's birth,

31997
08:38:04,680 --> 08:38:05,780
had been certain that.

31998
08:38:05,780 --> 08:38:06,800
He would.

31999
08:38:06,800 --> 08:38:08,420
This event had at last

32000
08:38:08,420 --> 08:38:09,620
been despaired of.

32001
08:38:09,680 --> 08:38:10,980
But it was then too late

32002
08:38:10,980 --> 08:38:12,180
to be saving.

32003
08:38:12,320 --> 08:38:12,800
Mrs.

32004
08:38:12,800 --> 08:38:13,640
Bennett had no

32005
08:38:13,640 --> 08:38:14,840
turn for economy

32006
08:38:15,060 --> 08:38:15,960
and her husband's

32007
08:38:15,960 --> 08:38:17,160
love of independence

32008
08:38:17,280 --> 08:38:18,480
had alone prevented

32009
08:38:18,480 --> 08:38:19,260
their exceeding

32010
08:38:19,260 --> 08:38:20,460
their income.

32011
08:38:21,140 --> 08:38:23,220
?5,000 was settled

32012
08:38:23,220 --> 08:38:24,360
by marriage articles

32013
08:38:24,360 --> 08:38:24,800
on Mrs.

32014
08:38:24,800 --> 08:38:26,000
Bennett, the children.

32015
08:38:26,400 --> 08:38:27,720
But in what proportions

32016
08:38:27,720 --> 08:38:28,500
it should be divided

32017
08:38:28,500 --> 08:38:29,660
amongst the latter

32018
08:38:29,660 --> 08:38:30,860
depended on the will

32019
08:38:30,860 --> 08:38:32,060
of the parents.

32020
08:38:32,240 --> 08:38:32,880
This was.

32021
08:38:32,880 --> 08:38:34,340
One point with regard

32022
08:38:34,340 --> 08:38:35,540
to Lydia at least.

32023
08:38:35,540 --> 08:38:35,940
Which was.

32024
08:38:35,940 --> 08:38:37,140
Now to be settled,

32025
08:38:37,160 --> 08:38:37,700
and Mr.

32026
08:38:37,700 --> 08:38:38,040
Bennett

32027
08:38:38,040 --> 08:38:39,180
could have no hesitation

32028
08:38:39,180 --> 08:38:39,720
in acceding

32029
08:38:39,720 --> 08:38:40,440
to the proposal

32030
08:38:40,440 --> 08:38:41,640
before him

32031
08:38:41,720 --> 08:38:43,040
in terms of grateful

32032
08:38:43,040 --> 08:38:43,800
acknowledgment

32033
08:38:43,800 --> 08:38:45,000
for the kindness of his.

32034
08:38:45,480 --> 08:38:46,260
Though expressed

32035
08:38:46,260 --> 08:38:47,460
most concisely,

32036
08:38:47,780 --> 08:38:48,720
he then delivered

32037
08:38:48,720 --> 08:38:49,380
on paper

32038
08:38:49,380 --> 08:38:50,760
his perfect approbation

32039
08:38:50,760 --> 08:38:51,960
of all that was done

32040
08:38:51,980 --> 08:38:52,880
at his willingness

32041
08:38:52,880 --> 08:38:53,340
to fulfill

32042
08:38:53,340 --> 08:38:54,120
the engagements

32043
08:38:54,120 --> 08:38:54,540
that had been

32044
08:38:54,540 --> 08:38:55,740
made for him.

32045
08:38:55,800 --> 08:38:56,300
He had never.

32046
08:38:56,300 --> 08:38:57,180
Before supposed

32047
08:38:57,180 --> 08:38:58,460
that could Wickham be

32048
08:38:58,460 --> 08:38:59,100
prevailed on

32049
08:38:59,100 --> 08:39:00,300
to marry his daughter.

32050
08:39:00,380 --> 08:39:01,200
It would be done

32051
08:39:01,200 --> 08:39:01,520
with so

32052
08:39:01,520 --> 08:39:02,520
little inconvenience

32053
08:39:02,520 --> 08:39:03,180
to himself

32054
08:39:03,180 --> 08:39:03,560
as by the

32055
08:39:03,560 --> 08:39:04,760
present arrangement.

32056
08:39:05,000 --> 08:39:06,840
He would scarcely be ?10

32057
08:39:06,840 --> 08:39:07,160
a year.

32058
08:39:07,160 --> 08:39:08,400
The loser by the hundred

32059
08:39:08,400 --> 08:39:09,660
that was to be paid them

32060
08:39:10,040 --> 08:39:11,340
for what with her board

32061
08:39:11,340 --> 08:39:12,540
and pocket allowance

32062
08:39:12,720 --> 08:39:13,200
and the

32063
08:39:13,200 --> 08:39:14,400
continual presents

32064
08:39:14,460 --> 08:39:14,780
money

32065
08:39:14,780 --> 08:39:15,600
which passed to her

32066
08:39:15,600 --> 08:39:15,860
through her

32067
08:39:15,860 --> 08:39:17,000
mother's hands.

32068
08:39:17,000 --> 08:39:18,200
Lydia's expenses

32069
08:39:18,200 --> 08:39:19,140
had been very little

32070
08:39:19,140 --> 08:39:19,700
within that.

32071
08:39:19,700 --> 08:39:20,900
Sum

32072
08:39:21,180 --> 08:39:21,960
that it would be done

32073
08:39:21,960 --> 08:39:22,100
with.

32074
08:39:22,100 --> 08:39:23,340
Such trifling exertion

32075
08:39:23,340 --> 08:39:24,540
on his side to

32076
08:39:24,620 --> 08:39:25,200
was another

32077
08:39:25,200 --> 08:39:26,520
very welcome surprise

32078
08:39:26,880 --> 08:39:28,380
for his wish at present

32079
08:39:28,380 --> 08:39:28,940
was to have

32080
08:39:28,940 --> 08:39:29,640
as little trouble

32081
08:39:29,640 --> 08:39:30,240
in the business

32082
08:39:30,240 --> 08:39:31,440
as possible.

32083
08:39:31,520 --> 08:39:32,300
When the first

32084
08:39:32,300 --> 08:39:33,680
transports of rage,

32085
08:39:33,680 --> 08:39:35,100
which had his activity

32086
08:39:35,100 --> 08:39:35,640
in seeking

32087
08:39:35,640 --> 08:39:36,740
her were over,

32088
08:39:36,740 --> 08:39:37,820
he naturally returned

32089
08:39:37,820 --> 08:39:38,460
to all his

32090
08:39:38,460 --> 08:39:39,660
former indolence.

32091
08:39:39,840 --> 08:39:40,580
His letter was

32092
08:39:40,580 --> 08:39:41,780
soon dispatched

32093
08:39:41,780 --> 08:39:42,980
for though dilatory

32094
08:39:42,980 --> 08:39:44,180
and undertaking.

32095
08:39:44,280 --> 08:39:45,080
He was quick

32096
08:39:45,080 --> 08:39:46,280
in its execution.

32097
08:39:46,620 --> 08:39:47,760
He begged to no further

32098
08:39:47,760 --> 08:39:48,360
particulars

32099
08:39:48,360 --> 08:39:48,960
of what he was

32100
08:39:48,960 --> 08:39:50,160
indebted to his brother.

32101
08:39:50,340 --> 08:39:50,700
But was.

32102
08:39:50,700 --> 08:39:51,300
Too angry

32103
08:39:51,300 --> 08:39:51,840
with Lydia

32104
08:39:51,840 --> 08:39:52,880
to send any message

32105
08:39:52,880 --> 08:39:54,080
to her.

32106
08:39:54,140 --> 08:39:54,980
The good news

32107
08:39:54,980 --> 08:39:55,800
spread quickly

32108
08:39:55,800 --> 08:39:56,720
through the house

32109
08:39:56,720 --> 08:39:57,780
and with proportionate

32110
08:39:57,780 --> 08:39:58,400
speed

32111
08:39:58,400 --> 08:39:59,600
through the neighborhood

32112
08:39:59,660 --> 08:40:00,380
it was born

32113
08:40:00,380 --> 08:40:00,980
and the latter

32114
08:40:00,980 --> 08:40:02,300
with decent philosophy.

32115
08:40:02,700 --> 08:40:03,420
To be sure.

32116
08:40:03,420 --> 08:40:04,200
It would have been more

32117
08:40:04,200 --> 08:40:04,880
for the advantage

32118
08:40:04,880 --> 08:40:06,500
of conversation had Ms..

32119
08:40:06,500 --> 08:40:07,260
Lydia Bennett

32120
08:40:07,260 --> 08:40:08,460
come upon the town,

32121
08:40:08,540 --> 08:40:09,240
or as the

32122
08:40:09,240 --> 08:40:10,440
happiest alternative.

32123
08:40:10,560 --> 08:40:11,460
Being secluded.

32124
08:40:11,460 --> 08:40:12,140
From the world

32125
08:40:12,140 --> 08:40:12,660
in some

32126
08:40:12,660 --> 08:40:13,980
distant farmhouse.

32127
08:40:14,520 --> 08:40:15,780
But there was much to be

32128
08:40:15,780 --> 08:40:16,440
talked of in

32129
08:40:16,440 --> 08:40:17,340
marrying her

32130
08:40:17,340 --> 08:40:18,320
and the good natured

32131
08:40:18,320 --> 08:40:19,020
wishes for her

32132
08:40:19,020 --> 08:40:19,620
well doing,

32133
08:40:19,620 --> 08:40:19,920
which had

32134
08:40:19,920 --> 08:40:20,780
proceeded before

32135
08:40:20,780 --> 08:40:21,800
from all the spiteful

32136
08:40:21,800 --> 08:40:23,060
old ladies in Meriton.

32137
08:40:23,400 --> 08:40:24,120
Lost, but a.

32138
08:40:24,120 --> 08:40:25,220
Little of their spirit

32139
08:40:25,220 --> 08:40:26,040
in this change

32140
08:40:26,040 --> 08:40:27,240
of circumstances.

32141
08:40:27,440 --> 08:40:28,080
Because with

32142
08:40:28,080 --> 08:40:29,280
such a husband.

32143
08:40:29,340 --> 08:40:30,000
Her misery

32144
08:40:30,000 --> 08:40:31,320
was considered certain.

32145
08:40:32,280 --> 08:40:32,760
It was a.

32146
08:40:32,760 --> 08:40:33,900
Fortnight since Mrs.

32147
08:40:33,900 --> 08:40:34,380
Bennett had

32148
08:40:34,380 --> 08:40:35,580
been downstairs.

32149
08:40:35,580 --> 08:40:36,180
But on this.

32150
08:40:36,180 --> 08:40:36,800
Happy day,

32151
08:40:36,800 --> 08:40:37,320
she again

32152
08:40:37,320 --> 08:40:37,940
took her seat

32153
08:40:37,940 --> 08:40:39,140
at the head of the table

32154
08:40:39,140 --> 08:40:40,100
and in spirits,

32155
08:40:40,100 --> 08:40:41,300
oppressively high,

32156
08:40:41,780 --> 08:40:43,340
no sentiment of shame.

32157
08:40:43,560 --> 08:40:44,760
It damped her triumph.

32158
08:40:45,000 --> 08:40:45,620
The marriage

32159
08:40:45,620 --> 08:40:46,440
of a daughter,

32160
08:40:46,440 --> 08:40:47,540
which had been the first

32161
08:40:47,540 --> 08:40:48,780
object of her wishes

32162
08:40:48,780 --> 08:40:50,220
since Jane was 16.

32163
08:40:50,540 --> 08:40:51,740
Was now on the point

32164
08:40:51,740 --> 08:40:52,920
of accomplishment,

32165
08:40:52,920 --> 08:40:53,280
and her.

32166
08:40:53,280 --> 08:40:54,440
Thoughts and her words

32167
08:40:54,440 --> 08:40:55,640
ran wholly on those.

32168
08:40:55,640 --> 08:40:56,220
Attendance.

32169
08:40:56,220 --> 08:40:57,420
Of elegant nuptials,

32170
08:40:57,600 --> 08:40:58,800
fine Muslins,

32171
08:40:58,820 --> 08:40:59,780
new carriages

32172
08:40:59,780 --> 08:41:00,980
and servants.

32173
08:41:01,080 --> 08:41:01,920
She was busily

32174
08:41:01,920 --> 08:41:02,400
searching

32175
08:41:02,400 --> 08:41:03,120
through the neighborhood

32176
08:41:03,120 --> 08:41:04,380
for a proper situation

32177
08:41:04,380 --> 08:41:05,400
for her daughter

32178
08:41:05,400 --> 08:41:06,360
and without knowing

32179
08:41:06,360 --> 08:41:07,040
or considering

32180
08:41:07,040 --> 08:41:07,740
what their income

32181
08:41:07,740 --> 08:41:09,240
might be rejected,

32182
08:41:09,240 --> 08:41:10,280
many as deficient

32183
08:41:10,280 --> 08:41:12,140
in size and importance.

32184
08:41:13,100 --> 08:41:14,040
Hey, Park

32185
08:41:14,040 --> 08:41:15,240
might do,

32186
08:41:15,440 --> 08:41:16,460
said she.

32187
08:41:16,460 --> 08:41:17,520
If the Goldings

32188
08:41:17,520 --> 08:41:18,420
could quit it.

32189
08:41:18,420 --> 08:41:19,280
Or the great house

32190
08:41:19,280 --> 08:41:20,420
at Stoke.

32191
08:41:20,420 --> 08:41:21,680
If the drawing room were

32192
08:41:22,640 --> 08:41:23,640
but Ashworth

32193
08:41:23,640 --> 08:41:24,860
is too far off,

32194
08:41:25,140 --> 08:41:26,300
I could not bear

32195
08:41:26,300 --> 08:41:26,760
to have her

32196
08:41:26,760 --> 08:41:28,100
ten miles from me

32197
08:41:28,560 --> 08:41:29,180
and ask for

32198
08:41:29,180 --> 08:41:30,440
pull this lodge.

32199
08:41:30,660 --> 08:41:31,700
The attics.

32200
08:41:31,700 --> 08:41:32,900
Dreadful.

32201
08:41:33,600 --> 08:41:34,280
Her husband

32202
08:41:34,280 --> 08:41:35,480
allowed her to talk on

32203
08:41:35,480 --> 08:41:36,440
without interruption

32204
08:41:36,440 --> 08:41:36,680
while the

32205
08:41:36,680 --> 08:41:37,880
servants remained.

32206
08:41:38,220 --> 08:41:38,900
But when they had.

32207
08:41:38,900 --> 08:41:40,100
Withdrawn, he said to.

32208
08:41:40,100 --> 08:41:40,820
Her, Mrs.

32209
08:41:40,820 --> 08:41:41,300
Bennett,

32210
08:41:41,300 --> 08:41:42,720
before you take any or

32211
08:41:42,720 --> 08:41:43,980
all of these houses

32212
08:41:43,980 --> 08:41:44,540
for your son

32213
08:41:44,540 --> 08:41:45,260
and daughter.

32214
08:41:45,260 --> 08:41:46,100
Let us come to a

32215
08:41:46,100 --> 08:41:47,420
right understanding

32216
08:41:47,420 --> 08:41:49,160
into one house

32217
08:41:49,160 --> 08:41:50,220
in this neighborhood.

32218
08:41:50,220 --> 08:41:51,420
They shall never have.

32219
08:41:51,740 --> 08:41:52,800
I will not encourage

32220
08:41:52,800 --> 08:41:54,140
the imprudence of either

32221
08:41:54,300 --> 08:41:55,380
by receiving them

32222
08:41:55,380 --> 08:41:56,580
at long born.

32223
08:41:56,760 --> 08:41:58,020
A long dispute.

32224
08:41:58,020 --> 08:41:58,500
Followed

32225
08:41:58,500 --> 08:41:59,700
this declaration.

32226
08:41:59,700 --> 08:42:00,180
But Mr.

32227
08:42:00,180 --> 08:42:01,380
Bennett was firm.

32228
08:42:01,740 --> 08:42:03,380
It soon led to another.

32229
08:42:03,620 --> 08:42:04,200
And Mrs.

32230
08:42:04,200 --> 08:42:04,520
Bennett

32231
08:42:04,520 --> 08:42:06,020
found with amazement

32232
08:42:06,020 --> 08:42:07,320
and horror that her.

32233
08:42:07,320 --> 08:42:07,940
Husband would

32234
08:42:07,940 --> 08:42:09,360
not advance a guinea to.

32235
08:42:09,360 --> 08:42:10,260
Buy clothes

32236
08:42:10,260 --> 08:42:11,460
for daughter.

32237
08:42:11,600 --> 08:42:12,500
He protested

32238
08:42:12,500 --> 08:42:13,020
that she should

32239
08:42:13,020 --> 08:42:13,740
receive from him

32240
08:42:13,740 --> 08:42:15,000
no mark of affection,

32241
08:42:15,000 --> 08:42:15,540
whatever,

32242
08:42:15,540 --> 08:42:16,740
on the occasion.

32243
08:42:16,940 --> 08:42:17,400
Mrs.

32244
08:42:17,400 --> 08:42:17,760
Bennett

32245
08:42:17,760 --> 08:42:18,980
could hardly comprehend.

32246
08:42:18,980 --> 08:42:19,860
It that.

32247
08:42:19,860 --> 08:42:20,580
His anger

32248
08:42:20,580 --> 08:42:21,500
be carried to such.

32249
08:42:21,500 --> 08:42:21,960
A point of.

32250
08:42:21,960 --> 08:42:23,540
Inconceivable resentment

32251
08:42:23,540 --> 08:42:23,900
as to.

32252
08:42:23,900 --> 08:42:25,220
Refuse his daughter

32253
08:42:25,220 --> 08:42:26,160
a privilege

32254
08:42:26,160 --> 08:42:26,900
without which.

32255
08:42:26,900 --> 08:42:27,480
Her marriage

32256
08:42:27,480 --> 08:42:28,160
would scarcely

32257
08:42:28,160 --> 08:42:29,160
seem valid,

32258
08:42:29,160 --> 08:42:30,240
exceeded all,

32259
08:42:30,240 --> 08:42:30,600
she could

32260
08:42:30,600 --> 08:42:31,800
believe possible.

32261
08:42:32,040 --> 08:42:32,460
She was.

32262
08:42:32,460 --> 08:42:33,300
More alive

32263
08:42:33,300 --> 08:42:34,140
to the disgrace

32264
08:42:34,140 --> 08:42:35,000
which her want of new

32265
08:42:35,000 --> 08:42:36,360
clothes must reflect on.

32266
08:42:36,360 --> 08:42:37,560
Her daughter's nuptials

32267
08:42:37,640 --> 08:42:38,480
than to any sense.

32268
08:42:38,480 --> 08:42:39,720
Of shame at her eloping

32269
08:42:39,720 --> 08:42:40,220
and living

32270
08:42:40,220 --> 08:42:40,760
with Wickham a.

32271
08:42:40,760 --> 08:42:42,140
Fortnight before.

32272
08:42:42,180 --> 08:42:43,100
They took place.

32273
08:42:44,160 --> 08:42:44,960
Elizabeth was

32274
08:42:44,960 --> 08:42:46,020
now most heartily

32275
08:42:46,020 --> 08:42:47,220
sorry that she had,

32276
08:42:47,360 --> 08:42:48,120
from the distress

32277
08:42:48,120 --> 08:42:48,920
of the moment,

32278
08:42:48,920 --> 08:42:50,160
being led to make Mr.

32279
08:42:50,160 --> 08:42:51,080
Darcy, acquainted

32280
08:42:51,080 --> 08:42:51,860
with their fears

32281
08:42:51,860 --> 08:42:53,280
for her sister, for

32282
08:42:53,280 --> 08:42:54,180
since her marriage

32283
08:42:54,180 --> 08:42:54,900
would so shortly

32284
08:42:54,900 --> 08:42:55,160
give the

32285
08:42:55,160 --> 08:42:56,180
proper termination

32286
08:42:56,180 --> 08:42:57,380
to the elopement.

32287
08:42:57,380 --> 08:42:58,200
They might hope to.

32288
08:42:58,200 --> 08:42:59,480
Conceal its unfavorable

32289
08:42:59,480 --> 08:43:00,800
beginning from all those

32290
08:43:00,800 --> 08:43:01,820
who were not immediately

32291
08:43:01,820 --> 08:43:03,020
on the spot.

32292
08:43:03,300 --> 08:43:04,260
She had no fear of

32293
08:43:04,260 --> 08:43:04,800
its spreading

32294
08:43:04,800 --> 08:43:05,220
father

32295
08:43:05,220 --> 08:43:06,380
through his means.

32296
08:43:06,380 --> 08:43:07,320
There were few people.

32297
08:43:07,320 --> 08:43:08,160
On whose secrecy

32298
08:43:08,160 --> 08:43:08,600
she would have

32299
08:43:08,600 --> 08:43:09,800
more confidently,

32300
08:43:10,280 --> 08:43:11,640
but at the same time

32301
08:43:11,640 --> 08:43:12,440
there was no one

32302
08:43:12,440 --> 08:43:13,040
whose knowledge

32303
08:43:13,040 --> 08:43:14,280
of a sister's frailty.

32304
08:43:14,420 --> 08:43:15,380
Would have mortified.

32305
08:43:15,380 --> 08:43:15,780
Her so.

32306
08:43:15,780 --> 08:43:17,460
Much, not, however.

32307
08:43:17,460 --> 08:43:18,080
From any fear

32308
08:43:18,080 --> 08:43:19,160
of disadvantage, from it

32309
08:43:19,160 --> 08:43:20,480
individually to herself.

32310
08:43:20,840 --> 08:43:21,780
For at any rate,

32311
08:43:21,780 --> 08:43:22,200
there seemed

32312
08:43:22,200 --> 08:43:23,400
a gulf impassable

32313
08:43:23,400 --> 08:43:24,600
between them.

32314
08:43:24,780 --> 08:43:25,920
Had Lydia's marriage.

32315
08:43:25,920 --> 08:43:26,760
Been concluded on the.

32316
08:43:26,760 --> 08:43:27,960
Most honorable terms?

32317
08:43:28,140 --> 08:43:28,920
It was not be.

32318
08:43:28,920 --> 08:43:29,900
Suppose that Mr..

32319
08:43:29,900 --> 08:43:30,440
Darcy would

32320
08:43:30,440 --> 08:43:31,200
connect himself

32321
08:43:31,200 --> 08:43:32,400
with a family where

32322
08:43:32,580 --> 08:43:33,440
to every other

32323
08:43:33,440 --> 08:43:34,280
objection.

32324
08:43:34,280 --> 08:43:34,940
Would now be.

32325
08:43:34,940 --> 08:43:35,960
Added an alliance

32326
08:43:35,960 --> 08:43:36,780
and relationship

32327
08:43:36,780 --> 08:43:37,980
of the nearest kind.

32328
08:43:38,000 --> 08:43:39,200
With a man whom he so

32329
08:43:39,200 --> 08:43:40,440
justly scorned.

32330
08:43:41,160 --> 08:43:42,420
From such a connection.

32331
08:43:42,420 --> 08:43:43,340
She could not wonder

32332
08:43:43,340 --> 08:43:44,540
that he would shrink.

32333
08:43:44,600 --> 08:43:45,240
The wish of.

32334
08:43:45,240 --> 08:43:46,440
Procuring her regard.

32335
08:43:46,500 --> 08:43:47,280
Which she had.

32336
08:43:47,280 --> 08:43:48,020
Assured herself

32337
08:43:48,020 --> 08:43:48,660
of his feeling,

32338
08:43:48,660 --> 08:43:49,700
and Derbyshire.

32339
08:43:49,700 --> 08:43:50,900
Could not, in rational.

32340
08:43:50,900 --> 08:43:52,340
Expectation, survive

32341
08:43:52,340 --> 08:43:53,220
such a blow as.

32342
08:43:53,220 --> 08:43:54,140
This.

32343
08:43:54,140 --> 08:43:55,320
She was humbled.

32344
08:43:55,320 --> 08:43:56,520
She was grieved.

32345
08:43:56,640 --> 08:43:57,600
She repented.

32346
08:43:57,600 --> 08:43:58,580
Though she hardly knew

32347
08:43:58,580 --> 08:44:00,060
of what she became

32348
08:44:00,060 --> 08:44:01,400
jealous of his esteem

32349
08:44:01,400 --> 08:44:01,980
when she could

32350
08:44:01,980 --> 08:44:02,720
no longer hope

32351
08:44:02,720 --> 08:44:03,920
to be benefited by it.

32352
08:44:04,340 --> 08:44:05,060
She wanted to

32353
08:44:05,060 --> 08:44:05,880
hear. Of him

32354
08:44:05,880 --> 08:44:06,660
when there seemed

32355
08:44:06,660 --> 08:44:07,580
the least chance

32356
08:44:07,580 --> 08:44:08,780
of gaining intelligence.

32357
08:44:09,200 --> 08:44:09,680
She was.

32358
08:44:09,680 --> 08:44:10,400
Convinced that

32359
08:44:10,400 --> 08:44:10,700
she could

32360
08:44:10,700 --> 08:44:11,400
have been happy

32361
08:44:11,400 --> 08:44:12,000
with him.

32362
08:44:12,000 --> 08:44:12,260
When it.

32363
08:44:12,260 --> 08:44:12,980
Was no longer

32364
08:44:12,980 --> 08:44:13,700
likely they.

32365
08:44:13,700 --> 08:44:14,900
Should meet.

32366
08:44:15,120 --> 08:44:16,580
What a triumph for him,

32367
08:44:16,580 --> 08:44:17,780
as she often thought.

32368
08:44:17,940 --> 08:44:18,860
Could he know

32369
08:44:18,860 --> 08:44:19,560
the proposals

32370
08:44:19,560 --> 08:44:19,980
which she had

32371
08:44:19,980 --> 08:44:21,080
proudly spurned

32372
08:44:21,080 --> 08:44:22,320
only four months ago.

32373
08:44:22,580 --> 08:44:23,100
Would now

32374
08:44:23,100 --> 08:44:23,780
have been most.

32375
08:44:23,780 --> 08:44:24,380
Gladly

32376
08:44:24,380 --> 08:44:25,880
and gratefully received?

32377
08:44:26,360 --> 08:44:27,560
He was as generous.

32378
08:44:27,560 --> 08:44:28,200
She doubted.

32379
08:44:28,200 --> 08:44:29,040
Not as the

32380
08:44:29,040 --> 08:44:29,880
most generous.

32381
08:44:29,880 --> 08:44:30,860
Of his sex.

32382
08:44:30,860 --> 08:44:32,280
But while he was mortal.

32383
08:44:32,280 --> 08:44:33,840
There must be a triumph.

32384
08:44:34,820 --> 08:44:35,820
She began now to

32385
08:44:35,820 --> 08:44:36,500
comprehend that

32386
08:44:36,500 --> 08:44:37,820
he was exactly the man

32387
08:44:37,820 --> 08:44:39,300
who in disposition

32388
08:44:39,300 --> 08:44:40,220
and talents.

32389
08:44:40,220 --> 08:44:41,160
Would most suit.

32390
08:44:41,160 --> 08:44:41,840
Her.

32391
08:44:41,840 --> 08:44:42,920
His understanding

32392
08:44:42,920 --> 08:44:43,820
and temper,

32393
08:44:43,820 --> 08:44:45,020
though unlike her own,

32394
08:44:45,180 --> 08:44:45,980
would have answered

32395
08:44:45,980 --> 08:44:47,180
all her wishes.

32396
08:44:47,480 --> 08:44:48,440
It was union

32397
08:44:48,440 --> 08:44:49,020
that must have

32398
08:44:49,020 --> 08:44:49,440
been to the

32399
08:44:49,440 --> 08:44:50,000
advantage of.

32400
08:44:50,000 --> 08:44:50,700
Both.

32401
08:44:50,700 --> 08:44:51,500
By her ease

32402
08:44:51,500 --> 08:44:52,620
and liveliness.

32403
08:44:52,620 --> 08:44:53,640
His mind might have

32404
08:44:53,640 --> 08:44:54,180
been soft

32405
08:44:54,180 --> 08:44:54,840
and his

32406
08:44:54,840 --> 08:44:56,040
manners improved.

32407
08:44:56,280 --> 08:44:56,940
And from his.

32408
08:44:56,940 --> 08:44:58,160
Judgment, information

32409
08:44:58,240 --> 08:44:58,800
and knowledge

32410
08:44:58,800 --> 08:44:59,600
of the world.

32411
08:44:59,600 --> 08:45:00,760
She must have received.

32412
08:45:00,760 --> 08:45:01,260
A benefit

32413
08:45:01,260 --> 08:45:02,660
of greater importance.

32414
08:45:03,380 --> 08:45:04,400
But no such

32415
08:45:04,400 --> 08:45:05,100
happy marriage

32416
08:45:05,100 --> 08:45:05,880
could now teach

32417
08:45:05,880 --> 08:45:06,500
the admiring.

32418
08:45:06,500 --> 08:45:07,080
Multitude

32419
08:45:07,080 --> 08:45:07,820
what connubial.

32420
08:45:07,820 --> 08:45:09,020
Felicity really was

32421
08:45:09,440 --> 08:45:10,080
and union

32422
08:45:10,080 --> 08:45:11,460
of a different tendency

32423
08:45:11,640 --> 08:45:12,540
and precluding

32424
08:45:12,540 --> 08:45:13,220
the possibility

32425
08:45:13,220 --> 08:45:13,980
of the other.

32426
08:45:13,980 --> 08:45:14,600
Was soon.

32427
08:45:14,600 --> 08:45:15,300
To be formed

32428
08:45:15,300 --> 08:45:16,500
in their family.

32429
08:45:16,980 --> 08:45:17,660
How Wickham.

32430
08:45:17,660 --> 08:45:18,320
And Lydia

32431
08:45:18,320 --> 08:45:19,040
to be supported

32432
08:45:19,040 --> 08:45:19,700
intolerable

32433
08:45:19,700 --> 08:45:20,580
independence.

32434
08:45:20,580 --> 08:45:21,780
She could not imagine.

32435
08:45:22,100 --> 08:45:22,920
But how little of

32436
08:45:22,920 --> 08:45:23,840
permanent happiness

32437
08:45:23,840 --> 08:45:24,900
could belong to a couple

32438
08:45:24,900 --> 08:45:25,140
who were

32439
08:45:25,140 --> 08:45:26,340
only brought together

32440
08:45:26,400 --> 08:45:27,540
because their passions

32441
08:45:27,540 --> 08:45:28,260
were stronger,

32442
08:45:28,260 --> 08:45:29,180
their virtue.

32443
08:45:29,180 --> 08:45:30,180
She could easily

32444
08:45:30,180 --> 08:45:31,380
conjecture.

32445
08:45:31,500 --> 08:45:31,860
Mr.

32446
08:45:31,860 --> 08:45:33,200
Gardner soon wrote again

32447
08:45:33,200 --> 08:45:34,940
to his brother, to Mr.

32448
08:45:34,940 --> 08:45:35,280
Bennett's

32449
08:45:35,280 --> 08:45:36,020
acknowledgments.

32450
08:45:36,020 --> 08:45:37,220
He briefly replied

32451
08:45:37,320 --> 08:45:38,120
with assurance

32452
08:45:38,120 --> 08:45:38,900
of his eagerness

32453
08:45:38,900 --> 08:45:39,900
to promote the welfare

32454
08:45:39,900 --> 08:45:41,100
of any of his family

32455
08:45:41,300 --> 08:45:42,120
and concluded

32456
08:45:42,120 --> 08:45:42,840
with entreaties

32457
08:45:42,840 --> 08:45:43,580
that the subject

32458
08:45:43,580 --> 08:45:44,280
might never be

32459
08:45:44,280 --> 08:45:45,480
mentioned to him again.

32460
08:45:45,740 --> 08:45:46,820
The principal purport

32461
08:45:46,820 --> 08:45:47,600
of his letter.

32462
08:45:47,600 --> 08:45:48,020
Was to.

32463
08:45:48,020 --> 08:45:49,100
Inform them that Mr.

32464
08:45:49,100 --> 08:45:50,060
Wickham had resolved

32465
08:45:50,060 --> 08:45:51,260
on quitting the militia.

32466
08:45:52,200 --> 08:45:53,480
It was greatly my wish

32467
08:45:53,480 --> 08:45:54,180
that he should do

32468
08:45:54,180 --> 08:45:55,380
so, he. Added.

32469
08:45:55,520 --> 08:45:56,520
As soon as his marriage

32470
08:45:56,520 --> 08:45:57,360
was fixed on.

32471
08:45:57,360 --> 08:45:57,800
And I think

32472
08:45:57,800 --> 08:45:58,740
he will agree with me

32473
08:45:58,740 --> 08:46:00,000
in considering a removal

32474
08:46:00,000 --> 08:46:00,840
from that corps

32475
08:46:00,840 --> 08:46:02,040
as highly advisable,

32476
08:46:02,720 --> 08:46:03,600
both on his account

32477
08:46:03,600 --> 08:46:04,440
and my niece's.

32478
08:46:05,600 --> 08:46:06,200
It is Mr.

32479
08:46:06,200 --> 08:46:07,040
Wickham's intention

32480
08:46:07,040 --> 08:46:08,240
to go into the

32481
08:46:08,700 --> 08:46:09,260
and among

32482
08:46:09,260 --> 08:46:10,460
his former friends.

32483
08:46:10,460 --> 08:46:11,400
There are still some

32484
08:46:11,400 --> 08:46:12,800
who are able and willing

32485
08:46:12,800 --> 08:46:13,440
to assist him

32486
08:46:13,440 --> 08:46:14,640
in the Army.

32487
08:46:15,360 --> 08:46:16,220
He has the promise

32488
08:46:16,220 --> 08:46:17,060
of an insurgency

32489
08:46:17,060 --> 08:46:18,260
in regiment

32490
08:46:19,160 --> 08:46:19,860
now quartered

32491
08:46:19,860 --> 08:46:20,960
in the north.

32492
08:46:20,960 --> 08:46:21,900
It is an advantage

32493
08:46:21,900 --> 08:46:22,260
to have it

32494
08:46:22,260 --> 08:46:22,800
so far

32495
08:46:22,800 --> 08:46:23,420
from this part

32496
08:46:23,420 --> 08:46:24,620
of the kingdom.

32497
08:46:24,860 --> 08:46:26,060
He promises fairly,

32498
08:46:26,400 --> 08:46:26,960
and I hope

32499
08:46:26,960 --> 08:46:28,160
among different people

32500
08:46:28,280 --> 08:46:29,240
where they may each

32501
08:46:29,240 --> 08:46:29,940
have a character

32502
08:46:29,940 --> 08:46:30,740
to preserve.

32503
08:46:30,740 --> 08:46:31,040
They will

32504
08:46:31,040 --> 08:46:32,240
both be more prudent.

32505
08:46:32,480 --> 08:46:33,060
I have written

32506
08:46:33,060 --> 08:46:34,260
to Colonel Foster

32507
08:46:34,320 --> 08:46:35,300
to inform him of our

32508
08:46:35,300 --> 08:46:36,500
present arrangements

32509
08:46:36,600 --> 08:46:37,380
and to request

32510
08:46:37,380 --> 08:46:38,300
that he will satisfy

32511
08:46:38,300 --> 08:46:38,780
the various

32512
08:46:38,780 --> 08:46:39,720
creditors of Mr.

32513
08:46:39,720 --> 08:46:40,040
Wickham

32514
08:46:40,040 --> 08:46:41,240
in a near Brighton

32515
08:46:41,340 --> 08:46:42,240
with assurances

32516
08:46:42,240 --> 08:46:43,340
of speedy payment

32517
08:46:43,340 --> 08:46:43,700
for which

32518
08:46:43,700 --> 08:46:44,900
I have pledged myself.

32519
08:46:45,500 --> 08:46:45,900
And will you

32520
08:46:45,900 --> 08:46:46,940
give yourself the

32521
08:46:46,940 --> 08:46:47,360
of carrying

32522
08:46:47,360 --> 08:46:48,540
similar assurances

32523
08:46:48,540 --> 08:46:49,380
to his creditors

32524
08:46:49,380 --> 08:46:50,720
in Meriton, of whom

32525
08:46:50,720 --> 08:46:52,040
I shall sub join a list?

32526
08:46:52,280 --> 08:46:52,920
According to

32527
08:46:52,920 --> 08:46:53,700
his information

32528
08:46:54,900 --> 08:46:55,200
he has

32529
08:46:55,200 --> 08:46:56,660
given in all his debts,

32530
08:46:56,660 --> 08:46:57,300
I hope at least

32531
08:46:57,300 --> 08:46:58,500
he has not deceived us.

32532
08:46:59,760 --> 08:47:00,440
Augustin has

32533
08:47:00,440 --> 08:47:01,440
our directions

32534
08:47:01,440 --> 08:47:02,160
and all will be

32535
08:47:02,160 --> 08:47:03,360
completed in a week.

32536
08:47:03,440 --> 08:47:03,720
They will

32537
08:47:03,720 --> 08:47:04,980
then join his regiment

32538
08:47:04,980 --> 08:47:06,020
unless they are first

32539
08:47:06,020 --> 08:47:07,640
invited too long born.

32540
08:47:07,760 --> 08:47:08,600
And I understand

32541
08:47:08,600 --> 08:47:09,060
from Mrs.

32542
08:47:09,060 --> 08:47:10,260
Gardner that my niece

32543
08:47:10,260 --> 08:47:11,240
is very desirous

32544
08:47:11,240 --> 08:47:12,360
of seeing you all

32545
08:47:12,360 --> 08:47:13,160
before she leaves

32546
08:47:13,160 --> 08:47:13,820
the South.

32547
08:47:13,820 --> 08:47:15,260
She is well and begs

32548
08:47:15,260 --> 08:47:15,480
to be

32549
08:47:15,480 --> 08:47:16,460
dutifully remembered

32550
08:47:16,460 --> 08:47:17,660
to you and her mother.

32551
08:47:17,940 --> 08:47:19,140
Yours, etc..

32552
08:47:19,500 --> 08:47:20,700
E Gardner.

32553
08:47:21,440 --> 08:47:21,840
Mr.

32554
08:47:21,840 --> 08:47:22,200
Bennett

32555
08:47:22,200 --> 08:47:22,940
and his daughters

32556
08:47:22,940 --> 08:47:24,240
saw all the advantages

32557
08:47:24,240 --> 08:47:25,100
of Wickham's removal

32558
08:47:25,100 --> 08:47:25,940
from the blank shore

32559
08:47:25,940 --> 08:47:26,940
as clearly as Mr.

32560
08:47:26,940 --> 08:47:27,540
Gardiner could.

32561
08:47:27,540 --> 08:47:28,280
Do.

32562
08:47:28,280 --> 08:47:28,820
But Mrs.

32563
08:47:28,820 --> 08:47:29,900
Bennett was not so well

32564
08:47:29,900 --> 08:47:30,900
pleased with it.

32565
08:47:30,900 --> 08:47:31,440
Lydia's

32566
08:47:31,440 --> 08:47:32,040
being settled

32567
08:47:32,040 --> 08:47:32,820
in the north

32568
08:47:32,820 --> 08:47:33,420
just when she

32569
08:47:33,420 --> 08:47:34,040
had expected

32570
08:47:34,040 --> 08:47:34,740
most pleasure

32571
08:47:34,740 --> 08:47:35,480
and pride in her.

32572
08:47:35,480 --> 08:47:36,680
Company for.

32573
08:47:36,720 --> 08:47:37,520
Had by no means

32574
08:47:37,520 --> 08:47:37,940
given up.

32575
08:47:37,940 --> 08:47:38,460
Her plan

32576
08:47:38,460 --> 08:47:39,120
of their residing

32577
08:47:39,120 --> 08:47:40,160
in Hertfordshire

32578
08:47:40,160 --> 08:47:40,500
was a

32579
08:47:40,500 --> 08:47:41,700
severe disappointment.

32580
08:47:42,020 --> 08:47:42,840
And besides,

32581
08:47:42,840 --> 08:47:43,980
it was such a pity that.

32582
08:47:43,980 --> 08:47:44,900
Lydia should be taken

32583
08:47:44,900 --> 08:47:45,560
from her regiment

32584
08:47:45,560 --> 08:47:45,960
where she was

32585
08:47:45,960 --> 08:47:46,460
acquainted with.

32586
08:47:46,460 --> 08:47:47,640
Everybody had had.

32587
08:47:47,640 --> 08:47:48,840
So many favorites.

32588
08:47:49,440 --> 08:47:51,380
She is so fond of Mrs.

32589
08:47:51,380 --> 08:47:52,980
Foster, said she.

32590
08:47:53,280 --> 08:47:53,660
It will be

32591
08:47:53,660 --> 08:47:54,500
quite shocking

32592
08:47:54,500 --> 08:47:55,700
to send her away

32593
08:47:55,820 --> 08:47:56,840
and are several

32594
08:47:56,840 --> 08:47:57,740
of the young men too,

32595
08:47:57,740 --> 08:47:58,320
that she likes

32596
08:47:58,320 --> 08:47:59,240
very much.

32597
08:47:59,240 --> 08:48:00,500
The officers may not be

32598
08:48:00,500 --> 08:48:01,160
so pleasant

32599
08:48:01,160 --> 08:48:01,640
in general

32600
08:48:01,640 --> 08:48:02,720
Blanc's regiment.

32601
08:48:02,720 --> 08:48:03,440
His daughter's

32602
08:48:03,440 --> 08:48:04,700
request for such

32603
08:48:04,700 --> 08:48:05,900
it might be considered

32604
08:48:05,960 --> 08:48:06,860
of being admitted

32605
08:48:06,860 --> 08:48:07,880
into her family again

32606
08:48:07,880 --> 08:48:08,700
before she set off

32607
08:48:08,700 --> 08:48:10,020
for the North, received

32608
08:48:10,020 --> 08:48:10,500
at first

32609
08:48:10,500 --> 08:48:12,000
in absolute negative.

32610
08:48:12,480 --> 08:48:13,940
But Jane and Elizabeth,

32611
08:48:14,160 --> 08:48:15,320
who agreed in wishing

32612
08:48:15,320 --> 08:48:15,840
for sake

32613
08:48:15,840 --> 08:48:16,520
of their sister's

32614
08:48:16,520 --> 08:48:17,780
feelings in consequence

32615
08:48:17,960 --> 08:48:18,620
that she should

32616
08:48:18,620 --> 08:48:19,380
be noticed

32617
08:48:19,380 --> 08:48:20,180
on her marriage

32618
08:48:20,180 --> 08:48:21,380
by her parents,

32619
08:48:21,380 --> 08:48:22,200
urged him so

32620
08:48:22,200 --> 08:48:23,120
earnestly, yet

32621
08:48:23,120 --> 08:48:24,000
so rationally

32622
08:48:24,000 --> 08:48:25,200
and so mildly.

32623
08:48:25,320 --> 08:48:25,520
To.

32624
08:48:25,520 --> 08:48:26,160
Receive her

32625
08:48:26,160 --> 08:48:26,900
and her husband

32626
08:48:26,900 --> 08:48:27,740
that long born

32627
08:48:27,740 --> 08:48:28,340
as soon as they were

32628
08:48:28,340 --> 08:48:29,240
married. That.

32629
08:48:29,240 --> 08:48:30,180
He was prevailed on

32630
08:48:30,180 --> 08:48:30,720
to think as.

32631
08:48:30,720 --> 08:48:31,320
They thought.

32632
08:48:31,320 --> 08:48:32,820
And act as they wished.

32633
08:48:33,300 --> 08:48:34,140
And their mother

32634
08:48:34,140 --> 08:48:35,180
had the satisfaction

32635
08:48:35,180 --> 08:48:35,640
knowing that

32636
08:48:35,640 --> 08:48:36,200
she would be able

32637
08:48:36,200 --> 08:48:36,680
to show her

32638
08:48:36,680 --> 08:48:37,400
married daughter

32639
08:48:37,400 --> 08:48:38,400
in the neighborhood

32640
08:48:38,400 --> 08:48:39,620
before she was banished

32641
08:48:39,620 --> 08:48:40,820
to the north.

32642
08:48:40,860 --> 08:48:41,340
When Mr.

32643
08:48:41,340 --> 08:48:42,120
Bennett wrote again

32644
08:48:42,120 --> 08:48:42,720
to his brother,

32645
08:48:42,720 --> 08:48:44,060
therefore he sent his

32646
08:48:44,060 --> 08:48:44,900
permission for them

32647
08:48:44,900 --> 08:48:46,560
come, and it was settled

32648
08:48:46,560 --> 08:48:47,240
that as soon as the

32649
08:48:47,240 --> 08:48:48,440
ceremony was over.

32650
08:48:48,600 --> 08:48:48,960
They should.

32651
08:48:48,960 --> 08:48:50,180
Proceed to long born.

32652
08:48:50,660 --> 08:48:51,960
Elizabeth was surprised,

32653
08:48:51,960 --> 08:48:52,880
however, that Wickham

32654
08:48:52,880 --> 08:48:53,640
should consent to.

32655
08:48:53,640 --> 08:48:54,800
Such a scheme, and.

32656
08:48:54,800 --> 08:48:55,760
Had she consulted

32657
08:48:55,760 --> 08:48:56,360
only her own.

32658
08:48:56,360 --> 08:48:57,420
Inclination,

32659
08:48:57,420 --> 08:48:58,260
any meeting with.

32660
08:48:58,260 --> 08:48:58,980
Him would have been

32661
08:48:58,980 --> 08:49:00,240
the last object of

32662
08:49:00,240 --> 08:49:00,900
her wishes.

32663
08:49:02,640 --> 08:49:03,840
Chapter 51.

32664
08:49:05,060 --> 08:49:05,760
Their sister's

32665
08:49:05,760 --> 08:49:06,960
wedding day arrived

32666
08:49:06,980 --> 08:49:07,760
and Jane

32667
08:49:07,760 --> 08:49:08,360
and Elizabeth

32668
08:49:08,360 --> 08:49:09,600
felt for her probably

32669
08:49:09,600 --> 08:49:10,040
more than she

32670
08:49:10,040 --> 08:49:11,240
felt for herself.

32671
08:49:11,460 --> 08:49:12,380
The carriage was sent

32672
08:49:12,380 --> 08:49:13,580
to meet them at blank

32673
08:49:13,740 --> 08:49:14,760
and they were to return

32674
08:49:14,760 --> 08:49:15,960
in it by dinnertime.

32675
08:49:16,160 --> 08:49:16,860
Their arrival

32676
08:49:16,860 --> 08:49:18,060
was dreaded by the elder

32677
08:49:18,060 --> 08:49:18,920
Miss Bennetts

32678
08:49:18,920 --> 08:49:19,640
and Jane

32679
08:49:19,640 --> 08:49:20,780
more, especially,

32680
08:49:20,780 --> 08:49:21,600
who gave Lydia

32681
08:49:21,600 --> 08:49:22,160
the feelings

32682
08:49:22,160 --> 08:49:22,580
which would have

32683
08:49:22,580 --> 08:49:23,640
attended herself

32684
08:49:23,640 --> 08:49:24,960
had she been the culprit

32685
08:49:25,200 --> 08:49:26,160
and was wretched in

32686
08:49:26,160 --> 08:49:26,840
the thought of what

32687
08:49:26,840 --> 08:49:28,140
her sister must endure.

32688
08:49:28,920 --> 08:49:29,940
They came.

32689
08:49:29,940 --> 08:49:30,600
The family

32690
08:49:30,600 --> 08:49:31,220
were assembled

32691
08:49:31,220 --> 08:49:32,040
in the breakfast room

32692
08:49:32,040 --> 08:49:33,200
to receive them.

32693
08:49:33,200 --> 08:49:33,940
Smiles

32694
08:49:33,940 --> 08:49:35,040
decked the face of Mrs.

32695
08:49:35,040 --> 08:49:35,900
Bennett as the carriage

32696
08:49:35,900 --> 08:49:37,100
drove up to the door.

32697
08:49:37,140 --> 08:49:38,000
Her husband looked

32698
08:49:38,000 --> 08:49:38,640
impenetrable.

32699
08:49:38,640 --> 08:49:39,380
Grave.

32700
08:49:39,380 --> 08:49:40,280
Her daughters.

32701
08:49:40,280 --> 08:49:41,040
Alarmed.

32702
08:49:41,040 --> 08:49:41,760
Anxious.

32703
08:49:41,760 --> 08:49:42,800
Uneasy.

32704
08:49:42,800 --> 08:49:43,680
Lydia's voice

32705
08:49:43,680 --> 08:49:44,160
was heard

32706
08:49:44,160 --> 08:49:45,080
in the vestibule.

32707
08:49:45,080 --> 08:49:46,380
The door was thrown open

32708
08:49:46,380 --> 08:49:46,680
and she

32709
08:49:46,680 --> 08:49:47,880
ran into the room.

32710
08:49:48,000 --> 08:49:48,840
Her mother stepped

32711
08:49:48,840 --> 08:49:50,000
forward, embraced her,

32712
08:49:50,000 --> 08:49:50,700
and welcomed her

32713
08:49:50,700 --> 08:49:51,660
with rapture.

32714
08:49:51,660 --> 08:49:52,500
Gave her hand

32715
08:49:52,500 --> 08:49:53,280
with affectionate

32716
08:49:53,280 --> 08:49:53,840
smile to.

32717
08:49:53,840 --> 08:49:55,080
Wickham, who followed.

32718
08:49:55,080 --> 08:49:55,260
His.

32719
08:49:55,260 --> 08:49:56,400
Lady and wished.

32720
08:49:56,400 --> 08:49:57,240
Them both joy

32721
08:49:57,240 --> 08:49:58,040
with an alacrity

32722
08:49:58,040 --> 08:49:59,240
which showed no doubt

32723
08:49:59,240 --> 08:50:00,440
of their happiness.

32724
08:50:00,740 --> 08:50:02,040
Their reception from Mr.

32725
08:50:02,040 --> 08:50:02,880
Bennett to whom they

32726
08:50:02,880 --> 08:50:03,680
then turned

32727
08:50:03,680 --> 08:50:04,520
was not quite

32728
08:50:04,520 --> 08:50:05,580
so cordial.

32729
08:50:05,580 --> 08:50:06,680
His countenance rather

32730
08:50:06,680 --> 08:50:08,000
gained in austerity,

32731
08:50:08,120 --> 08:50:09,000
and he scarcely

32732
08:50:09,000 --> 08:50:10,200
opened his lips.

32733
08:50:10,340 --> 08:50:10,920
The easy.

32734
08:50:10,920 --> 08:50:11,600
Assurance of

32735
08:50:11,600 --> 08:50:12,720
the young couple

32736
08:50:12,720 --> 08:50:13,580
was enough to provoke.

32737
08:50:13,580 --> 08:50:14,220
Him.

32738
08:50:14,220 --> 08:50:15,740
Elizabeth was disgusted,

32739
08:50:15,900 --> 08:50:16,640
and even Miss

32740
08:50:16,640 --> 08:50:17,840
Bennett was shocked.

32741
08:50:17,900 --> 08:50:18,720
Lydia was.

32742
08:50:18,720 --> 08:50:20,660
Lydia still untamed,

32743
08:50:20,660 --> 08:50:21,920
unabashed, wild,

32744
08:50:21,920 --> 08:50:23,120
noisy and fearless.

32745
08:50:23,420 --> 08:50:24,660
She turned from sister

32746
08:50:24,660 --> 08:50:25,460
to sister,

32747
08:50:25,460 --> 08:50:26,220
demanding their

32748
08:50:26,220 --> 08:50:27,420
congratulations,

32749
08:50:27,500 --> 08:50:28,260
and when at length

32750
08:50:28,260 --> 08:50:29,460
they all sat down.

32751
08:50:29,600 --> 08:50:29,840
Looked.

32752
08:50:29,840 --> 08:50:31,040
Eagerly round the room,

32753
08:50:31,220 --> 08:50:31,860
took notice

32754
08:50:31,860 --> 08:50:33,020
of some alteration

32755
08:50:33,020 --> 08:50:33,500
in it,

32756
08:50:33,500 --> 08:50:34,200
and observed

32757
08:50:34,200 --> 08:50:34,920
with a laugh

32758
08:50:34,920 --> 08:50:35,580
that it was a great

32759
08:50:35,580 --> 08:50:35,880
while

32760
08:50:35,880 --> 08:50:36,320
since she had

32761
08:50:36,320 --> 08:50:37,360
been there.

32762
08:50:37,360 --> 08:50:38,420
Wickham was not at all

32763
08:50:38,420 --> 08:50:39,140
more distressed

32764
08:50:39,140 --> 08:50:40,020
than herself.

32765
08:50:40,020 --> 08:50:40,800
But his manners

32766
08:50:40,800 --> 08:50:42,120
were always so pleasing.

32767
08:50:42,260 --> 08:50:43,040
Had his character

32768
08:50:43,040 --> 08:50:43,700
and his marriage

32769
08:50:43,700 --> 08:50:44,360
been exactly

32770
08:50:44,360 --> 08:50:45,260
what they ought.

32771
08:50:45,260 --> 08:50:46,080
His smiles

32772
08:50:46,080 --> 08:50:47,220
and his easy address

32773
08:50:47,220 --> 08:50:47,940
while he claimed

32774
08:50:47,940 --> 08:50:48,920
their relationship.

32775
08:50:48,920 --> 08:50:49,280
Would have.

32776
08:50:49,280 --> 08:50:50,480
Delighted them all.

32777
08:50:50,600 --> 08:50:51,960
Elizabeth had not before

32778
08:50:51,960 --> 08:50:53,220
believed him quite equal

32779
08:50:53,220 --> 08:50:54,420
to such assurance.

32780
08:50:54,440 --> 08:50:55,520
But she sat down,

32781
08:50:55,520 --> 08:50:56,660
resolving within herself

32782
08:50:56,660 --> 08:50:57,660
to draw no limits

32783
08:50:57,660 --> 08:50:58,140
and future

32784
08:50:58,140 --> 08:50:58,940
to the impudence

32785
08:50:58,940 --> 08:51:00,140
of an impudent man.

32786
08:51:00,420 --> 08:51:01,640
She blushed and.

32787
08:51:01,640 --> 08:51:02,780
Jane blushed,

32788
08:51:02,780 --> 08:51:03,720
but the cheeks of the

32789
08:51:03,720 --> 08:51:04,100
two who.

32790
08:51:04,100 --> 08:51:05,300
Caused their confusion

32791
08:51:05,460 --> 08:51:06,080
suffered no

32792
08:51:06,080 --> 08:51:07,280
variation of color.

32793
08:51:08,240 --> 08:51:08,580
There was

32794
08:51:08,580 --> 08:51:09,880
no want of discourse.

32795
08:51:09,900 --> 08:51:10,520
The bride

32796
08:51:10,520 --> 08:51:11,220
and her mother could.

32797
08:51:11,220 --> 08:51:11,820
Neither of them

32798
08:51:11,820 --> 08:51:13,020
talk fast enough.

32799
08:51:13,140 --> 08:51:13,740
And Wickham,

32800
08:51:13,740 --> 08:51:14,540
who happened to sit

32801
08:51:14,540 --> 08:51:15,840
near Elizabeth, began

32802
08:51:15,840 --> 08:51:16,440
inquiring

32803
08:51:16,440 --> 08:51:17,340
after his acquaintance

32804
08:51:17,340 --> 08:51:18,420
in that neighborhood.

32805
08:51:18,420 --> 08:51:18,860
With a good.

32806
08:51:18,860 --> 08:51:19,560
Humored ease,

32807
08:51:19,560 --> 08:51:20,060
which she felt

32808
08:51:20,060 --> 08:51:21,180
very unable to equal

32809
08:51:21,180 --> 08:51:22,380
in her replies.

32810
08:51:22,400 --> 08:51:23,000
They seemed.

32811
08:51:23,000 --> 08:51:23,520
Each of them,

32812
08:51:23,520 --> 08:51:23,780
to have

32813
08:51:23,780 --> 08:51:24,360
the happiest

32814
08:51:24,360 --> 08:51:25,560
memories in the world.

32815
08:51:25,700 --> 08:51:26,660
Nothing of the past

32816
08:51:26,660 --> 08:51:27,300
was recollected

32817
08:51:27,300 --> 08:51:28,940
with pain and led Lydia

32818
08:51:28,940 --> 08:51:29,700
in voluntarily

32819
08:51:29,700 --> 08:51:30,420
to subjects

32820
08:51:30,420 --> 08:51:31,220
which her sisters

32821
08:51:31,220 --> 08:51:31,640
would not have

32822
08:51:31,640 --> 08:51:32,340
alluded to.

32823
08:51:32,340 --> 08:51:33,540
For the world.

32824
08:51:33,800 --> 08:51:34,640
Only think of it

32825
08:51:34,640 --> 08:51:35,820
being three months.

32826
08:51:35,820 --> 08:51:36,620
She cried.

32827
08:51:36,620 --> 08:51:37,740
Since I went away,

32828
08:51:37,740 --> 08:51:38,240
it seems.

32829
08:51:38,240 --> 08:51:38,960
But a fortnight,

32830
08:51:38,960 --> 08:51:39,780
I declare.

32831
08:51:39,780 --> 08:51:40,140
And yet

32832
08:51:40,140 --> 08:51:40,860
there have been things.

32833
08:51:40,860 --> 08:51:41,240
Enough

32834
08:51:41,240 --> 08:51:42,440
happened in the time.

32835
08:51:42,600 --> 08:51:43,500
Good gracious.

32836
08:51:43,500 --> 08:51:44,180
When I went away,

32837
08:51:44,180 --> 08:51:44,540
I am sure

32838
08:51:44,540 --> 08:51:45,420
I had no more idea

32839
08:51:45,420 --> 08:51:46,020
of being married

32840
08:51:46,020 --> 08:51:47,220
till I came back again.

32841
08:51:47,560 --> 08:51:47,880
There

32842
08:51:47,880 --> 08:51:48,560
I thought it would be

32843
08:51:48,560 --> 08:51:50,060
very good fun if I was.

32844
08:51:50,820 --> 08:51:51,840
Her father lifted up

32845
08:51:51,840 --> 08:51:52,700
his eyes.

32846
08:51:52,700 --> 08:51:53,960
Jane was distressed.

32847
08:51:54,260 --> 08:51:54,840
Elizabeth

32848
08:51:54,840 --> 08:51:55,760
looked expressively

32849
08:51:55,760 --> 08:51:56,700
at Lydia.

32850
08:51:56,700 --> 08:51:57,920
But she, who never heard

32851
08:51:57,920 --> 08:51:58,960
or saw anything of which

32852
08:51:58,960 --> 08:51:59,400
she chose

32853
08:51:59,400 --> 08:52:00,560
to be insensible.

32854
08:52:00,560 --> 08:52:01,760
Cayley continued,

32855
08:52:02,000 --> 08:52:02,780
Oh, Mama,

32856
08:52:02,780 --> 08:52:03,480
do the people here

32857
08:52:03,480 --> 08:52:03,960
about to know

32858
08:52:03,960 --> 08:52:04,980
I am married today?

32859
08:52:04,980 --> 08:52:05,580
I was afraid

32860
08:52:05,580 --> 08:52:06,380
they might not.

32861
08:52:06,380 --> 08:52:07,460
And we overtook William

32862
08:52:07,460 --> 08:52:08,660
Golding and his coracle.

32863
08:52:08,820 --> 08:52:09,660
So I was determined

32864
08:52:09,660 --> 08:52:10,440
he should know.

32865
08:52:10,440 --> 08:52:10,860
And so

32866
08:52:10,860 --> 08:52:11,880
I let down the side.

32867
08:52:11,880 --> 08:52:12,960
Glass next to him

32868
08:52:12,960 --> 08:52:14,160
and took off my glove

32869
08:52:14,300 --> 08:52:15,380
and let my hand

32870
08:52:15,380 --> 08:52:16,280
just rest

32871
08:52:16,280 --> 08:52:17,420
upon the window frame

32872
08:52:17,420 --> 08:52:18,020
so that he might

32873
08:52:18,020 --> 08:52:18,740
see the ring.

32874
08:52:18,740 --> 08:52:19,520
And then I bowed

32875
08:52:19,520 --> 08:52:20,180
and smiled.

32876
08:52:20,180 --> 08:52:21,180
Anything.

32877
08:52:21,180 --> 08:52:22,260
Elizabeth could bear it

32878
08:52:22,260 --> 08:52:23,000
no longer.

32879
08:52:23,000 --> 08:52:23,760
She got up

32880
08:52:23,760 --> 08:52:24,960
and ran out of the room

32881
08:52:24,960 --> 08:52:26,180
and returned no more

32882
08:52:26,400 --> 08:52:27,180
till she heard them

32883
08:52:27,180 --> 08:52:28,020
passing through the hall

32884
08:52:28,020 --> 08:52:29,120
to the dining parlor.

32885
08:52:29,120 --> 08:52:30,080
She then joined them

32886
08:52:30,080 --> 08:52:31,260
soon enough to see Lydia

32887
08:52:31,260 --> 08:52:32,460
with Anxious Parade

32888
08:52:32,520 --> 08:52:33,620
walk up to her mother's

32889
08:52:33,620 --> 08:52:34,440
right hand

32890
08:52:34,440 --> 08:52:35,580
and hear her say to her

32891
08:52:35,580 --> 08:52:36,780
eldest sister.

32892
08:52:36,980 --> 08:52:37,640
Oh, Jane,

32893
08:52:37,640 --> 08:52:38,580
I take your place.

32894
08:52:38,580 --> 08:52:39,480
Now and you must.

32895
08:52:39,480 --> 08:52:41,000
Go lower because I

32896
08:52:41,000 --> 08:52:42,200
am a married woman.

32897
08:52:42,860 --> 08:52:43,580
It was not to be.

32898
08:52:43,580 --> 08:52:44,040
Suppose

32899
08:52:44,040 --> 08:52:44,600
the time would

32900
08:52:44,600 --> 08:52:45,080
give Lydia

32901
08:52:45,080 --> 08:52:46,020
that embarrassment

32902
08:52:46,020 --> 08:52:46,860
from which she had been

32903
08:52:46,860 --> 08:52:48,260
so wholly free at first.

32904
08:52:48,600 --> 08:52:49,460
Her ease and good

32905
08:52:49,460 --> 08:52:50,660
spirits increased.

32906
08:52:50,880 --> 08:52:52,080
She longed to see Mrs.

32907
08:52:52,080 --> 08:52:53,300
Phillips, the Lucas's

32908
08:52:53,520 --> 08:52:54,080
and all their

32909
08:52:54,080 --> 08:52:54,840
other neighbors,

32910
08:52:54,840 --> 08:52:55,800
and to hear herself

32911
08:52:55,800 --> 08:52:56,660
called Mrs.

32912
08:52:56,660 --> 08:52:57,860
Wickham by each of them.

32913
08:52:58,220 --> 08:52:59,120
And in the meantime,

32914
08:52:59,120 --> 08:53:00,060
she went after dinner

32915
08:53:00,060 --> 08:53:01,040
to show her ring

32916
08:53:01,040 --> 08:53:01,580
and boast

32917
08:53:01,580 --> 08:53:02,780
of being married to Mrs.

32918
08:53:02,780 --> 08:53:03,240
Hale and the

32919
08:53:03,240 --> 08:53:04,080
two housemaids.

32920
08:53:05,060 --> 08:53:06,420
Well, Mama said.

32921
08:53:06,420 --> 08:53:07,140
She, when

32922
08:53:07,140 --> 08:53:07,880
they were all returned

32923
08:53:07,880 --> 08:53:09,020
to the breakfast room.

32924
08:53:09,020 --> 08:53:09,720
And what do you think

32925
08:53:09,720 --> 08:53:10,560
of my husband?

32926
08:53:10,560 --> 08:53:10,860
Is he

32927
08:53:10,860 --> 08:53:12,060
not a charming man?

32928
08:53:12,060 --> 08:53:13,020
I am sure my sisters

32929
08:53:13,020 --> 08:53:14,300
must all envy me.

32930
08:53:14,420 --> 08:53:15,500
I only hope they may

32931
08:53:15,500 --> 08:53:16,700
have half my good luck.

32932
08:53:16,920 --> 08:53:17,580
They must all

32933
08:53:17,580 --> 08:53:18,380
go to Brighton.

32934
08:53:18,380 --> 08:53:19,200
That is the place.

32935
08:53:19,200 --> 08:53:20,160
Get husbands.

32936
08:53:20,160 --> 08:53:21,240
What a pity it is, Mama.

32937
08:53:21,240 --> 08:53:22,440
We did not all go.

32938
08:53:22,920 --> 08:53:24,080
Very true.

32939
08:53:24,080 --> 08:53:25,280
And if I had my will,

32940
08:53:25,280 --> 08:53:26,340
we should.

32941
08:53:26,340 --> 08:53:27,140
But, my dear

32942
08:53:27,140 --> 08:53:28,520
Lydia, I don't at all

32943
08:53:28,520 --> 08:53:29,240
like your going

32944
08:53:29,240 --> 08:53:30,020
such way off.

32945
08:53:30,020 --> 08:53:31,220
Must it be so?

32946
08:53:31,640 --> 08:53:32,580
Oh, Lord, yes.

32947
08:53:32,580 --> 08:53:32,760
There is

32948
08:53:32,760 --> 08:53:33,560
nothing in that.

32949
08:53:33,560 --> 08:53:34,220
I should like it.

32950
08:53:34,220 --> 08:53:35,100
Of all things,

32951
08:53:35,100 --> 08:53:35,900
you and Papa

32952
08:53:35,900 --> 08:53:36,540
and my sisters

32953
08:53:36,540 --> 08:53:37,160
must come down

32954
08:53:37,160 --> 08:53:37,880
and see us.

32955
08:53:37,880 --> 08:53:39,080
We shall be at Newcastle

32956
08:53:39,080 --> 08:53:39,860
all the winter.

32957
08:53:39,860 --> 08:53:40,620
And I dare say

32958
08:53:40,620 --> 08:53:40,880
there will be

32959
08:53:40,880 --> 08:53:41,660
some bulls.

32960
08:53:41,660 --> 08:53:42,200
And I will take

32961
08:53:42,200 --> 08:53:42,660
good care

32962
08:53:42,660 --> 08:53:43,380
to get partners

32963
08:53:43,380 --> 08:53:44,580
for them all.

32964
08:53:44,760 --> 08:53:45,740
I should like it

32965
08:53:45,740 --> 08:53:47,220
beyond anything.

32966
08:53:47,580 --> 08:53:48,780
Said her mother.

32967
08:53:48,900 --> 08:53:49,400
And then.

32968
08:53:49,400 --> 08:53:50,180
When you go away,

32969
08:53:50,180 --> 08:53:50,840
you may leave.

32970
08:53:50,840 --> 08:53:51,900
One or two of my sisters

32971
08:53:51,900 --> 08:53:52,580
behind you.

32972
08:53:52,580 --> 08:53:53,940
And I daresay I.

32973
08:53:53,940 --> 08:53:54,260
Shall get

32974
08:53:54,260 --> 08:53:55,040
husbands for them

32975
08:53:55,040 --> 08:53:55,340
before the

32976
08:53:55,340 --> 08:53:56,180
winter is over.

32977
08:53:57,140 --> 08:53:58,220
I thank you for my.

32978
08:53:58,220 --> 08:53:58,620
Share the

32979
08:53:58,620 --> 08:54:00,080
favor, said Elizabeth.

32980
08:54:00,420 --> 08:54:00,740
But I

32981
08:54:00,740 --> 08:54:01,620
do not particularly

32982
08:54:01,620 --> 08:54:02,300
like your way

32983
08:54:02,300 --> 08:54:03,500
of getting husbands.

32984
08:54:04,080 --> 08:54:04,820
Their visitors

32985
08:54:04,820 --> 08:54:05,840
were not to remain above

32986
08:54:05,840 --> 08:54:07,040
ten days with them.

32987
08:54:07,080 --> 08:54:07,440
Mr.

32988
08:54:07,440 --> 08:54:08,240
Wickham had received

32989
08:54:08,240 --> 08:54:08,780
his commission

32990
08:54:08,780 --> 08:54:09,980
before he left London,

32991
08:54:10,100 --> 08:54:10,880
and he was to join

32992
08:54:10,880 --> 08:54:11,460
his regiment

32993
08:54:11,460 --> 08:54:12,020
at the end of

32994
08:54:12,020 --> 08:54:13,220
a fortnight.

32995
08:54:13,280 --> 08:54:13,940
No one but.

32996
08:54:13,940 --> 08:54:14,240
Mrs.

32997
08:54:14,240 --> 08:54:14,960
Bennett regretted

32998
08:54:14,960 --> 08:54:15,480
that their stay

32999
08:54:15,480 --> 08:54:16,580
would be so short.

33000
08:54:16,580 --> 08:54:16,880
And she.

33001
08:54:16,880 --> 08:54:17,480
Made the most

33002
08:54:17,480 --> 08:54:17,960
of the time

33003
08:54:17,960 --> 08:54:18,740
by visiting about

33004
08:54:18,740 --> 08:54:19,520
with her daughter

33005
08:54:19,520 --> 08:54:20,700
and having very frequent

33006
08:54:20,700 --> 08:54:21,240
parties at.

33007
08:54:21,240 --> 08:54:22,080
Home.

33008
08:54:22,080 --> 08:54:22,880
These parties

33009
08:54:22,880 --> 08:54:24,080
were acceptable to all

33010
08:54:24,260 --> 08:54:25,280
to avoid a family

33011
08:54:25,280 --> 08:54:26,240
circle was even more

33012
08:54:26,240 --> 08:54:26,880
desirable too.

33013
08:54:26,880 --> 08:54:27,260
Such as

33014
08:54:27,260 --> 08:54:28,020
did think

33015
08:54:28,020 --> 08:54:29,480
than such as did not.

33016
08:54:29,780 --> 08:54:30,740
Wickham's affection

33017
08:54:30,740 --> 08:54:31,980
for Lydia was just what

33018
08:54:31,980 --> 08:54:33,020
Elizabeth had expected

33019
08:54:33,020 --> 08:54:33,440
to find.

33020
08:54:33,440 --> 08:54:34,260
It not.

33021
08:54:34,260 --> 08:54:35,280
Equal to Lydia's.

33022
08:54:35,280 --> 08:54:36,140
For him,

33023
08:54:36,140 --> 08:54:37,020
she had scarcely

33024
08:54:37,020 --> 08:54:37,440
needed her

33025
08:54:37,440 --> 08:54:38,420
present observation

33026
08:54:38,420 --> 08:54:39,500
to be satisfied

33027
08:54:39,500 --> 08:54:40,200
from the reason

33028
08:54:40,200 --> 08:54:40,800
of things

33029
08:54:40,800 --> 08:54:41,640
that their elopement

33030
08:54:41,640 --> 08:54:42,420
had been brought on

33031
08:54:42,420 --> 08:54:42,980
by the strength

33032
08:54:42,980 --> 08:54:43,700
of her love

33033
08:54:43,700 --> 08:54:44,900
rather than by his.

33034
08:54:45,180 --> 08:54:45,680
And she would

33035
08:54:45,680 --> 08:54:46,620
have wondered why,

33036
08:54:46,620 --> 08:54:47,340
without violently

33037
08:54:47,340 --> 08:54:48,320
caring for her,

33038
08:54:48,320 --> 08:54:49,280
he chose to elope

33039
08:54:49,280 --> 08:54:50,280
with her at all.

33040
08:54:50,280 --> 08:54:51,660
Had she not felt certain

33041
08:54:51,660 --> 08:54:52,280
that his flight

33042
08:54:52,280 --> 08:54:52,700
was rendered

33043
08:54:52,700 --> 08:54:53,340
necessary

33044
08:54:53,340 --> 08:54:53,900
by distress

33045
08:54:53,900 --> 08:54:55,100
of circumstances?

33046
08:54:55,200 --> 08:54:55,760
And if that were

33047
08:54:55,760 --> 08:54:56,480
the case.

33048
08:54:56,480 --> 08:54:57,680
He was not the young.

33049
08:54:57,720 --> 08:54:58,920
To resist an opportunity

33050
08:54:58,920 --> 08:55:00,120
of having a companion.

33051
08:55:00,680 --> 08:55:02,040
Lydia was exceedingly

33052
08:55:02,040 --> 08:55:02,940
fond of him.

33053
08:55:02,940 --> 08:55:04,100
He was her dear

33054
08:55:04,100 --> 08:55:04,640
Wickham on

33055
08:55:04,640 --> 08:55:05,780
every occasion.

33056
08:55:05,780 --> 08:55:07,040
No one was to be put in

33057
08:55:07,040 --> 08:55:08,240
competition with him.

33058
08:55:08,300 --> 08:55:09,240
He did everything

33059
08:55:09,240 --> 08:55:10,380
best in the world,

33060
08:55:10,380 --> 08:55:11,120
and she was sure

33061
08:55:11,120 --> 08:55:12,240
he would kill more birds

33062
08:55:12,240 --> 08:55:13,260
on the 1st of September

33063
08:55:13,260 --> 08:55:14,160
than anybody else

33064
08:55:14,160 --> 08:55:15,360
in the country.

33065
08:55:15,560 --> 08:55:16,460
One morning, soon

33066
08:55:16,460 --> 08:55:17,340
after, their arrival

33067
08:55:17,340 --> 08:55:17,640
as she was

33068
08:55:17,640 --> 08:55:18,300
sitting with her two

33069
08:55:18,300 --> 08:55:19,260
older sisters,

33070
08:55:19,260 --> 08:55:20,460
she said to Elizabeth.

33071
08:55:21,000 --> 08:55:21,600
Lizzie,

33072
08:55:21,600 --> 08:55:22,400
I never gave you

33073
08:55:22,400 --> 08:55:22,760
an account of

33074
08:55:22,760 --> 08:55:23,240
my wedding.

33075
08:55:23,240 --> 08:55:23,840
I believe

33076
08:55:23,840 --> 08:55:24,740
you were not by

33077
08:55:24,740 --> 08:55:25,440
when I told Mama

33078
08:55:25,440 --> 08:55:25,820
and the others

33079
08:55:25,820 --> 08:55:26,640
all about it.

33080
08:55:26,640 --> 08:55:27,600
Are not you curious

33081
08:55:27,600 --> 08:55:27,900
to hear

33082
08:55:27,900 --> 08:55:29,100
how it was managed?

33083
08:55:29,460 --> 08:55:30,660
Not really.

33084
08:55:30,660 --> 08:55:31,860
Replied Elizabeth.

33085
08:55:31,880 --> 08:55:33,020
I think that cannot be

33086
08:55:33,020 --> 08:55:33,500
too little.

33087
08:55:33,500 --> 08:55:34,620
Said on the. Subject.

33088
08:55:35,800 --> 08:55:35,960
You were

33089
08:55:35,960 --> 08:55:37,200
so strange, but I

33090
08:55:37,200 --> 08:55:37,680
must tell you

33091
08:55:37,680 --> 08:55:38,480
how it went off.

33092
08:55:38,480 --> 08:55:39,060
We were married,

33093
08:55:39,060 --> 08:55:39,320
you know,

33094
08:55:39,320 --> 08:55:40,220
at St Clement's,

33095
08:55:40,220 --> 08:55:40,940
because Wickham's

33096
08:55:40,940 --> 08:55:41,420
lodgings

33097
08:55:41,420 --> 08:55:42,480
were in that parish

33098
08:55:42,480 --> 08:55:43,500
and it was settled that

33099
08:55:43,500 --> 08:55:44,220
we should all be there

33100
08:55:44,220 --> 08:55:45,240
by 11:00.

33101
08:55:45,240 --> 08:55:46,200
My uncle and aunt

33102
08:55:46,200 --> 08:55:46,460
and I

33103
08:55:46,460 --> 08:55:47,360
were to go together

33104
08:55:47,360 --> 08:55:47,960
and the others

33105
08:55:47,960 --> 08:55:48,380
were to meet us

33106
08:55:48,380 --> 08:55:49,220
at the church.

33107
08:55:49,220 --> 08:55:49,980
Well, Monday

33108
08:55:49,980 --> 08:55:50,660
morning came

33109
08:55:50,660 --> 08:55:51,240
and I was in

33110
08:55:51,240 --> 08:55:52,380
such a fuss.

33111
08:55:52,380 --> 08:55:53,220
I was so afraid,

33112
08:55:53,220 --> 08:55:53,400
you know.

33113
08:55:53,400 --> 08:55:53,960
That something would.

33114
08:55:53,960 --> 08:55:54,860
Happen to put it off.

33115
08:55:54,860 --> 08:55:55,220
And then

33116
08:55:55,220 --> 08:55:55,700
I should have gone

33117
08:55:55,700 --> 08:55:56,900
quite distract it.

33118
08:55:57,200 --> 08:55:58,380
And that was my aunt.

33119
08:55:58,380 --> 08:55:59,060
All the time

33120
08:55:59,060 --> 08:55:59,660
I was dressing,

33121
08:55:59,660 --> 08:56:00,360
preaching and

33122
08:56:00,360 --> 08:56:01,020
talking away,

33123
08:56:01,020 --> 08:56:01,460
just as if

33124
08:56:01,460 --> 08:56:01,940
she was reading

33125
08:56:01,940 --> 08:56:03,140
a sermon.

33126
08:56:03,140 --> 08:56:04,140
However, I did not

33127
08:56:04,140 --> 08:56:04,500
hear about

33128
08:56:04,500 --> 08:56:05,820
one word and ten for

33129
08:56:05,820 --> 08:56:06,380
I was thinking,

33130
08:56:06,380 --> 08:56:06,980
you may suppose,

33131
08:56:06,980 --> 08:56:08,180
of my dear Wickham.

33132
08:56:08,240 --> 08:56:09,080
I longed to know

33133
08:56:09,080 --> 08:56:09,440
whether he would

33134
08:56:09,440 --> 08:56:09,900
be married.

33135
08:56:09,900 --> 08:56:11,100
And his blue coat.

33136
08:56:11,460 --> 08:56:11,900
Well,

33137
08:56:11,900 --> 08:56:12,740
and so we breakfast

33138
08:56:12,740 --> 08:56:13,920
did at ten, as usual.

33139
08:56:13,920 --> 08:56:14,300
I thought

33140
08:56:14,300 --> 08:56:15,500
it would never be over

33141
08:56:15,620 --> 08:56:16,100
for by.

33142
08:56:16,100 --> 08:56:16,380
By.

33143
08:56:16,380 --> 08:56:17,220
You want to understand

33144
08:56:17,220 --> 08:56:18,140
that my uncle and aunt

33145
08:56:18,140 --> 08:56:19,160
were horrid, unpleasant.

33146
08:56:19,160 --> 08:56:19,760
All the time

33147
08:56:19,760 --> 08:56:20,660
I was with them.

33148
08:56:20,660 --> 08:56:21,560
If you believe me,

33149
08:56:21,560 --> 08:56:22,520
I did not once

33150
08:56:22,520 --> 08:56:23,160
put my foot

33151
08:56:23,160 --> 08:56:23,960
out of doors,

33152
08:56:23,960 --> 08:56:24,540
though I was there

33153
08:56:24,540 --> 08:56:25,440
a fortnight.

33154
08:56:25,440 --> 08:56:27,200
No one party or scheme

33155
08:56:27,200 --> 08:56:28,740
or anything, to be sure.

33156
08:56:28,760 --> 08:56:29,580
London was rather.

33157
08:56:29,580 --> 08:56:30,140
Thin,

33158
08:56:30,140 --> 08:56:30,740
but however,

33159
08:56:30,740 --> 08:56:31,020
the little

33160
08:56:31,020 --> 08:56:32,220
theater was open.

33161
08:56:32,400 --> 08:56:32,960
Well,

33162
08:56:32,960 --> 08:56:33,720
and so just

33163
08:56:33,720 --> 08:56:34,220
as the carriage

33164
08:56:34,220 --> 08:56:35,040
came to the door.

33165
08:56:35,040 --> 08:56:36,140
My was called away

33166
08:56:36,140 --> 08:56:36,840
upon business

33167
08:56:36,840 --> 08:56:38,060
to that horrid man, Mr.

33168
08:56:38,060 --> 08:56:38,780
Stone.

33169
08:56:38,780 --> 08:56:39,800
And then, you know,

33170
08:56:39,800 --> 08:56:40,340
when once

33171
08:56:40,340 --> 08:56:41,180
they got together,

33172
08:56:41,180 --> 08:56:42,380
there is no end of it.

33173
08:56:42,560 --> 08:56:43,760
I was so frightened,

33174
08:56:43,760 --> 08:56:44,300
I did not know

33175
08:56:44,300 --> 08:56:45,060
what to do.

33176
08:56:45,060 --> 08:56:46,560
My was to give me away.

33177
08:56:46,740 --> 08:56:47,240
And if we were

33178
08:56:47,240 --> 08:56:47,880
beyond the hour,

33179
08:56:47,880 --> 08:56:48,660
we could not be married

33180
08:56:48,660 --> 08:56:49,580
all day.

33181
08:56:49,580 --> 08:56:50,280
But luckily.

33182
08:56:50,280 --> 08:56:51,060
He came back again

33183
08:56:51,060 --> 08:56:52,040
in 10 minutes time.

33184
08:56:52,040 --> 08:56:53,400
And then we all set out.

33185
08:56:53,720 --> 08:56:54,140
However,

33186
08:56:54,140 --> 08:56:54,800
I recollected

33187
08:56:54,800 --> 08:56:55,380
afterwards,

33188
08:56:55,380 --> 08:56:56,160
if he had been prevented

33189
08:56:56,160 --> 08:56:56,640
going,

33190
08:56:56,640 --> 08:56:57,140
the wedding need

33191
08:56:57,140 --> 08:56:58,400
not be put off for Mr.

33192
08:56:58,400 --> 08:56:58,760
Darcy.

33193
08:56:58,760 --> 08:56:59,960
Might have done as well.

33194
08:57:00,540 --> 08:57:00,960
Mr.

33195
08:57:00,960 --> 08:57:02,900
Darcy repeated Elizabeth

33196
08:57:02,900 --> 08:57:04,100
in utter amazement.

33197
08:57:04,340 --> 08:57:04,980
Oh, yes,

33198
08:57:04,980 --> 08:57:05,580
he was to come there

33199
08:57:05,580 --> 08:57:06,780
with Wickham, you know.

33200
08:57:06,900 --> 08:57:08,120
Oh, good gracious me.

33201
08:57:08,400 --> 08:57:09,600
I quite forgot.

33202
08:57:09,840 --> 08:57:10,760
I ought not to have said

33203
08:57:10,760 --> 08:57:11,660
a word about it.

33204
08:57:11,660 --> 08:57:12,300
I promised them

33205
08:57:12,300 --> 08:57:13,500
so faithfully.

33206
08:57:13,680 --> 08:57:14,340
What Wickham?

33207
08:57:14,340 --> 08:57:15,060
Say it

33208
08:57:15,060 --> 08:57:16,380
was to be such a secret.

33209
08:57:17,340 --> 08:57:17,640
If it

33210
08:57:17,640 --> 08:57:18,840
was to be secret,

33211
08:57:19,020 --> 08:57:20,000
said Jane.

33212
08:57:20,000 --> 08:57:20,960
Say not another word

33213
08:57:20,960 --> 08:57:21,900
on the subject.

33214
08:57:21,900 --> 08:57:22,620
You may depend

33215
08:57:22,620 --> 08:57:23,460
upon my seeking

33216
08:57:23,460 --> 08:57:24,660
no further.

33217
08:57:24,960 --> 08:57:26,160
Oh, certainly.

33218
08:57:26,240 --> 08:57:27,020
Said Elizabeth,

33219
08:57:27,020 --> 08:57:27,740
though, burning with.

33220
08:57:27,740 --> 08:57:28,760
Curiosity,

33221
08:57:28,760 --> 08:57:29,400
We will ask you

33222
08:57:29,400 --> 08:57:30,600
no questions.

33223
08:57:30,800 --> 08:57:32,480
Thank you, said Lydia.

33224
08:57:32,680 --> 08:57:33,440
For if you did,

33225
08:57:33,440 --> 08:57:34,320
I should certainly

33226
08:57:34,320 --> 08:57:34,820
you all.

33227
08:57:34,820 --> 08:57:35,540
And then we can

33228
08:57:35,540 --> 08:57:36,740
be angry.

33229
08:57:37,100 --> 08:57:38,160
On such encouragement

33230
08:57:38,160 --> 08:57:38,880
to ask.

33231
08:57:38,880 --> 08:57:39,900
Elizabeth was forced

33232
08:57:39,900 --> 08:57:40,280
to put it

33233
08:57:40,280 --> 08:57:40,980
out of her power

33234
08:57:40,980 --> 08:57:42,180
by running away.

33235
08:57:42,560 --> 08:57:43,760
But to live in ignorance

33236
08:57:43,760 --> 08:57:44,120
on such

33237
08:57:44,120 --> 08:57:45,320
point was impossible.

33238
08:57:45,380 --> 08:57:45,960
Or at least

33239
08:57:45,960 --> 08:57:46,640
it was impossible

33240
08:57:46,640 --> 08:57:47,400
not to try.

33241
08:57:47,400 --> 08:57:48,600
For information.

33242
08:57:48,740 --> 08:57:49,140
Mr.

33243
08:57:49,140 --> 08:57:50,060
Darcy had been at her

33244
08:57:50,060 --> 08:57:51,260
sister's wedding.

33245
08:57:51,320 --> 08:57:52,860
It was exactly a scene

33246
08:57:53,000 --> 08:57:54,360
and exactly among people

33247
08:57:54,360 --> 08:57:55,260
where he had apparently.

33248
08:57:55,260 --> 08:57:56,300
Least to do

33249
08:57:56,300 --> 08:57:57,540
and least temptation

33250
08:57:57,540 --> 08:57:58,460
to go.

33251
08:57:58,460 --> 08:57:59,240
Conjectures

33252
08:57:59,240 --> 08:58:00,360
as to the meaning of it.

33253
08:58:00,360 --> 08:58:01,580
Rapid and wild

33254
08:58:01,580 --> 08:58:02,780
hurried into her brain,

33255
08:58:02,820 --> 08:58:04,020
but she was satisfied.

33256
08:58:04,020 --> 08:58:04,820
None.

33257
08:58:04,820 --> 08:58:05,700
Those that best

33258
08:58:05,700 --> 08:58:06,960
pleased her as placing

33259
08:58:06,960 --> 08:58:07,620
his conduct

33260
08:58:07,620 --> 08:58:08,780
in the noblest light.

33261
08:58:08,780 --> 08:58:09,540
Seemed most.

33262
08:58:09,540 --> 08:58:10,560
Improbable.

33263
08:58:10,560 --> 08:58:10,880
She could.

33264
08:58:10,880 --> 08:58:12,360
Not bear such suspense.

33265
08:58:12,600 --> 08:58:13,740
And hastily seizing.

33266
08:58:13,740 --> 08:58:14,960
Sheet of paper, wrote

33267
08:58:14,960 --> 08:58:15,620
a short letter

33268
08:58:15,620 --> 08:58:17,000
to her aunt to request

33269
08:58:17,000 --> 08:58:17,760
an explanation

33270
08:58:17,760 --> 08:58:18,000
of what

33271
08:58:18,000 --> 08:58:19,100
Lydia had dropped

33272
08:58:19,100 --> 08:58:20,100
If it were compatible

33273
08:58:20,100 --> 08:58:20,820
with the secrecy

33274
08:58:20,820 --> 08:58:22,020
which had been intended.

33275
08:58:22,380 --> 08:58:22,800
You may

33276
08:58:22,800 --> 08:58:24,000
readily comprehend.

33277
08:58:24,120 --> 08:58:25,080
She added,

33278
08:58:25,080 --> 08:58:26,280
What my curiosity

33279
08:58:26,280 --> 08:58:27,180
must be to know

33280
08:58:27,180 --> 08:58:27,780
how a person.

33281
08:58:27,780 --> 08:58:28,940
Unconnected with any of.

33282
08:58:28,940 --> 08:58:30,260
Us and comparatively

33283
08:58:30,260 --> 08:58:30,660
speaking,

33284
08:58:30,660 --> 08:58:31,280
a stranger

33285
08:58:31,280 --> 08:58:32,300
to our family,

33286
08:58:32,300 --> 08:58:32,820
should have been

33287
08:58:32,820 --> 08:58:33,480
amongst you at.

33288
08:58:33,480 --> 08:58:34,560
Such time.

33289
08:58:34,560 --> 08:58:35,300
Pray write.

33290
08:58:35,300 --> 08:58:35,960
Instantly and.

33291
08:58:35,960 --> 08:58:37,160
Let me understand it.

33292
08:58:37,460 --> 08:58:38,300
Unless it is

33293
08:58:38,300 --> 08:58:39,080
for very cogent.

33294
08:58:39,080 --> 08:58:39,500
Reasons

33295
08:58:39,500 --> 08:58:40,620
to remain in secrecy,

33296
08:58:40,620 --> 08:58:41,420
which Lydia seems

33297
08:58:41,420 --> 08:58:42,620
to think necessary,

33298
08:58:42,740 --> 08:58:43,880
and that I must endeavor

33299
08:58:43,880 --> 08:58:44,660
to be satisfied

33300
08:58:44,660 --> 08:58:45,860
with ignorance.

33301
08:58:46,220 --> 08:58:47,280
Not that I shall,

33302
08:58:47,280 --> 08:58:47,760
though.

33303
08:58:47,760 --> 08:58:48,780
She added to herself

33304
08:58:48,780 --> 08:58:49,280
as she finished

33305
08:58:49,280 --> 08:58:50,360
the letter.

33306
08:58:50,360 --> 08:58:51,360
And my dear aunt,

33307
08:58:51,360 --> 08:58:51,900
if you do not

33308
08:58:51,900 --> 08:58:52,220
tell me

33309
08:58:52,220 --> 08:58:53,420
in an honorable manner,

33310
08:58:53,460 --> 08:58:54,180
I shall suddenly

33311
08:58:54,180 --> 08:58:54,620
be reduced

33312
08:58:54,620 --> 08:58:55,860
to tricks and stratagems

33313
08:58:55,860 --> 08:58:57,060
to find it out.

33314
08:58:57,660 --> 08:58:58,580
Jane's delicate

33315
08:58:58,580 --> 08:58:59,340
sense of honor

33316
08:58:59,340 --> 08:59:00,000
would not allow her

33317
08:59:00,000 --> 08:59:00,360
to speak

33318
08:59:00,360 --> 08:59:00,900
to Elizabeth

33319
08:59:00,900 --> 08:59:01,640
privately of what

33320
08:59:01,640 --> 08:59:02,840
Lydia had let fall.

33321
08:59:03,000 --> 08:59:04,220
Elizabeth was glad of it

33322
08:59:04,460 --> 08:59:05,220
till it appeared

33323
08:59:05,220 --> 08:59:06,000
whether her inquiries

33324
08:59:06,000 --> 08:59:06,480
would receive

33325
08:59:06,480 --> 08:59:07,680
any satisfaction.

33326
08:59:07,740 --> 08:59:08,700
She had rather be

33327
08:59:08,700 --> 08:59:09,840
without a confidant.

33328
08:59:11,300 --> 08:59:12,500
Chapter 52

33329
08:59:13,700 --> 08:59:14,420
Elizabeth had

33330
08:59:14,420 --> 08:59:15,240
the satisfaction

33331
08:59:15,240 --> 08:59:16,220
of receiving an answer

33332
08:59:16,220 --> 08:59:16,860
to her letter

33333
08:59:16,860 --> 08:59:17,220
as soon as

33334
08:59:17,220 --> 08:59:18,420
she possibly could.

33335
08:59:18,480 --> 08:59:19,320
She was no sooner

33336
08:59:19,320 --> 08:59:20,220
in possession of it

33337
08:59:20,220 --> 08:59:21,180
than hurrying

33338
08:59:21,180 --> 08:59:22,220
into the little copse

33339
08:59:22,220 --> 08:59:22,740
where she was

33340
08:59:22,740 --> 08:59:23,360
least likely

33341
08:59:23,360 --> 08:59:24,480
to be interrupted.

33342
08:59:24,480 --> 08:59:25,440
She sat down on

33343
08:59:25,440 --> 08:59:26,180
one of the benches

33344
08:59:26,180 --> 08:59:27,380
and prepared to be happy

33345
08:59:27,560 --> 08:59:28,160
for the length

33346
08:59:28,160 --> 08:59:28,680
of the letter,

33347
08:59:28,680 --> 08:59:29,240
convinced her

33348
08:59:29,240 --> 08:59:29,600
that it did

33349
08:59:29,600 --> 08:59:31,020
not contain a denial.

33350
08:59:32,220 --> 08:59:33,420
Grace Church Street,

33351
08:59:33,440 --> 08:59:34,640
September 6th.

33352
08:59:34,980 --> 08:59:36,180
My dear niece,

33353
08:59:36,440 --> 08:59:37,560
I have just received

33354
08:59:37,560 --> 08:59:38,340
your letter

33355
08:59:38,340 --> 08:59:39,180
and shall devote

33356
08:59:39,180 --> 08:59:39,960
this whole morning

33357
08:59:39,960 --> 08:59:41,100
to answering it

33358
08:59:41,100 --> 08:59:42,140
as I foresee that

33359
08:59:42,140 --> 08:59:42,960
a little writing

33360
08:59:42,960 --> 08:59:43,800
will not comprise.

33361
08:59:43,800 --> 08:59:44,540
What I have to tell.

33362
08:59:44,540 --> 08:59:45,860
You. I must.

33363
08:59:45,860 --> 08:59:46,760
Confess myself.

33364
08:59:46,760 --> 08:59:47,360
Surprised

33365
08:59:47,360 --> 08:59:48,560
by your application?

33366
08:59:48,560 --> 08:59:49,080
I did not

33367
08:59:49,080 --> 08:59:50,280
expect it from you.

33368
08:59:50,760 --> 08:59:51,440
Don't think me.

33369
08:59:51,440 --> 08:59:51,860
Angry.

33370
08:59:51,860 --> 08:59:53,180
However, for I only mean

33371
08:59:53,180 --> 08:59:53,940
to let you know that

33372
08:59:53,940 --> 08:59:54,780
I had not imagined

33373
08:59:54,780 --> 08:59:55,500
such inquiries

33374
08:59:55,500 --> 08:59:56,120
to be necessary

33375
08:59:56,120 --> 08:59:57,320
on your side.

33376
08:59:57,440 --> 08:59:58,400
If you do not choose

33377
08:59:58,400 --> 08:59:59,540
to understand me,

33378
08:59:59,540 --> 09:00:00,840
forgive my impertinence.

33379
09:00:01,280 --> 09:00:02,040
Your uncle is.

33380
09:00:02,040 --> 09:00:03,000
As much surprised

33381
09:00:03,000 --> 09:00:03,840
as I am.

33382
09:00:03,840 --> 09:00:04,400
And nothing

33383
09:00:04,400 --> 09:00:05,000
but the belief

33384
09:00:05,000 --> 09:00:06,000
of your being a party

33385
09:00:06,000 --> 09:00:06,800
concerned

33386
09:00:06,800 --> 09:00:07,620
would have allowed him

33387
09:00:07,620 --> 09:00:08,820
to act as he has done.

33388
09:00:09,300 --> 09:00:10,260
But if you are really

33389
09:00:10,260 --> 09:00:11,460
innocent and, ignorant,

33390
09:00:11,660 --> 09:00:13,260
I must be more explicit.

33391
09:00:14,180 --> 09:00:14,900
On the very day

33392
09:00:14,900 --> 09:00:15,680
of my coming home

33393
09:00:15,680 --> 09:00:16,680
from London.

33394
09:00:16,680 --> 09:00:17,700
Your uncle had a most

33395
09:00:17,700 --> 09:00:18,980
unexpected visitor.

33396
09:00:19,500 --> 09:00:19,880
Mr.

33397
09:00:19,880 --> 09:00:21,200
Darcy called and was

33398
09:00:21,200 --> 09:00:21,980
shut up with him

33399
09:00:21,980 --> 09:00:23,120
several hours.

33400
09:00:23,120 --> 09:00:24,020
It was all over

33401
09:00:24,020 --> 09:00:25,200
before I arrived,

33402
09:00:25,200 --> 09:00:26,220
so my curiosity

33403
09:00:26,220 --> 09:00:26,660
was not so

33404
09:00:26,660 --> 09:00:27,440
dreadfully wrapped

33405
09:00:27,440 --> 09:00:27,920
as yours

33406
09:00:27,920 --> 09:00:29,120
seems to have been.

33407
09:00:29,280 --> 09:00:30,300
He came to town, Mr.

33408
09:00:30,300 --> 09:00:30,800
Gardner.

33409
09:00:30,800 --> 09:00:31,560
He had found out

33410
09:00:31,560 --> 09:00:32,160
where your sister

33411
09:00:32,160 --> 09:00:32,520
and Mr.

33412
09:00:32,520 --> 09:00:33,360
Wickham were,

33413
09:00:33,360 --> 09:00:34,340
and that he had seen

33414
09:00:34,340 --> 09:00:35,060
and talked with them.

33415
09:00:35,060 --> 09:00:36,860
Both Wickham repeatedly.

33416
09:00:37,020 --> 09:00:38,220
Lydia Once

33417
09:00:38,420 --> 09:00:39,720
from what I can collect,

33418
09:00:39,900 --> 09:00:41,220
he left Derbyshire

33419
09:00:41,220 --> 09:00:42,180
only one day.

33420
09:00:42,180 --> 09:00:43,560
After ourselves and.

33421
09:00:43,560 --> 09:00:44,460
Came to. Town with the.

33422
09:00:44,460 --> 09:00:45,000
Resolution

33423
09:00:45,000 --> 09:00:46,200
of hunting for them.

33424
09:00:46,340 --> 09:00:47,400
The motive professed

33425
09:00:47,400 --> 09:00:48,140
was his conviction

33426
09:00:48,140 --> 09:00:48,440
of its

33427
09:00:48,440 --> 09:00:49,800
being owing to himself

33428
09:00:49,940 --> 09:00:50,580
that Wickham's

33429
09:00:50,580 --> 09:00:51,380
worthlessness

33430
09:00:51,380 --> 09:00:52,380
had not been so well

33431
09:00:52,380 --> 09:00:53,100
known as.

33432
09:00:53,100 --> 09:00:53,460
To make it.

33433
09:00:53,460 --> 09:00:54,020
Impossible

33434
09:00:54,020 --> 09:00:54,740
for any young woman

33435
09:00:54,740 --> 09:00:56,040
of character to love or

33436
09:00:56,040 --> 09:00:57,240
confide in him.

33437
09:00:57,420 --> 09:00:58,080
He generously

33438
09:00:58,080 --> 09:00:58,940
imputed the whole

33439
09:00:58,940 --> 09:01:00,140
to his mistaken pride

33440
09:01:00,360 --> 09:01:01,160
and, confessed

33441
09:01:01,160 --> 09:01:01,980
that he had before

33442
09:01:01,980 --> 09:01:02,900
thought it beneath him

33443
09:01:02,900 --> 09:01:03,240
to lay

33444
09:01:03,240 --> 09:01:04,280
his private actions

33445
09:01:04,280 --> 09:01:05,480
open to the world.

33446
09:01:05,780 --> 09:01:06,500
His character

33447
09:01:06,500 --> 09:01:07,880
was to speak for itself.

33448
09:01:08,280 --> 09:01:09,060
He called it,

33449
09:01:09,060 --> 09:01:10,200
therefore his duty

33450
09:01:10,200 --> 09:01:11,240
to step forward

33451
09:01:11,240 --> 09:01:11,900
and endeavor

33452
09:01:11,900 --> 09:01:12,840
to remedy an evil

33453
09:01:12,840 --> 09:01:13,320
which had been

33454
09:01:13,320 --> 09:01:14,520
brought on by himself.

33455
09:01:14,940 --> 09:01:15,680
If he had

33456
09:01:15,680 --> 09:01:16,640
another motive,

33457
09:01:16,640 --> 09:01:17,780
I am sure it would never

33458
09:01:17,780 --> 09:01:18,980
disgrace him.

33459
09:01:19,260 --> 09:01:20,180
He had been some

33460
09:01:20,180 --> 09:01:20,940
in town before.

33461
09:01:20,940 --> 09:01:21,380
He was able to

33462
09:01:21,380 --> 09:01:22,280
discover them,

33463
09:01:22,280 --> 09:01:23,160
but he had something

33464
09:01:23,160 --> 09:01:24,300
to direct his search,

33465
09:01:24,300 --> 09:01:24,860
which was more

33466
09:01:24,860 --> 09:01:25,800
than we had.

33467
09:01:25,800 --> 09:01:26,700
And the consciousness.

33468
09:01:26,700 --> 09:01:27,020
Of this

33469
09:01:27,020 --> 09:01:27,800
was another reason

33470
09:01:27,800 --> 09:01:28,520
for his resolving.

33471
09:01:28,520 --> 09:01:29,720
To follow us.

33472
09:01:30,000 --> 09:01:30,860
There is a lady,

33473
09:01:30,860 --> 09:01:32,180
it seems, are Mrs.

33474
09:01:32,180 --> 09:01:32,840
Young,

33475
09:01:32,840 --> 09:01:34,020
who was some time ago

33476
09:01:34,020 --> 09:01:35,420
governess to Miss Darcy

33477
09:01:35,660 --> 09:01:36,560
and was dismissed

33478
09:01:36,560 --> 09:01:37,220
from her charge

33479
09:01:37,220 --> 09:01:37,920
on some cause

33480
09:01:37,920 --> 09:01:39,080
of disapprobation,

33481
09:01:39,080 --> 09:01:39,260
though

33482
09:01:39,260 --> 09:01:40,460
he did not say what.

33483
09:01:40,820 --> 09:01:41,820
She then took a large

33484
09:01:41,820 --> 09:01:43,020
house in Edward Street

33485
09:01:43,260 --> 09:01:43,740
and has

33486
09:01:43,740 --> 09:01:45,020
since maintained herself

33487
09:01:45,020 --> 09:01:46,220
by letting lodgings.

33488
09:01:46,580 --> 09:01:47,180
This Mrs.

33489
09:01:47,180 --> 09:01:47,960
Young was

33490
09:01:47,960 --> 09:01:49,160
he knew intimately

33491
09:01:49,320 --> 09:01:50,120
with Wickham

33492
09:01:50,120 --> 09:01:51,060
and he went to her

33493
09:01:51,060 --> 09:01:52,100
for intelligence of him

33494
09:01:52,100 --> 09:01:52,500
as soon as he

33495
09:01:52,500 --> 09:01:53,700
got to town.

33496
09:01:53,720 --> 09:01:54,480
But it was two.

33497
09:01:54,480 --> 09:01:55,460
Or three days before he.

33498
09:01:55,460 --> 09:01:56,120
Could get from her

33499
09:01:56,120 --> 09:01:57,300
what he wanted.

33500
09:01:57,300 --> 09:01:58,460
She would not betray her

33501
09:01:58,460 --> 09:01:59,660
trust, I suppose,

33502
09:01:59,700 --> 09:02:00,720
without bribery

33503
09:02:00,720 --> 09:02:01,820
and corruption.

33504
09:02:01,820 --> 09:02:02,900
For she really did know

33505
09:02:02,900 --> 09:02:03,720
where her friend was

33506
09:02:03,720 --> 09:02:04,880
to be found.

33507
09:02:04,880 --> 09:02:05,900
Wickham, indeed, had.

33508
09:02:05,900 --> 09:02:06,500
Gone to her

33509
09:02:06,500 --> 09:02:07,040
on their first

33510
09:02:07,040 --> 09:02:08,240
arrival in London.

33511
09:02:08,240 --> 09:02:09,140
And had she been able

33512
09:02:09,140 --> 09:02:09,680
to receive them

33513
09:02:09,680 --> 09:02:10,640
into her house.

33514
09:02:10,640 --> 09:02:11,100
They would have

33515
09:02:11,100 --> 09:02:11,960
taken up their abode

33516
09:02:11,960 --> 09:02:12,980
with her.

33517
09:02:12,980 --> 09:02:13,620
At length,

33518
09:02:13,620 --> 09:02:14,660
however, our kind

33519
09:02:14,660 --> 09:02:15,400
friend procure

33520
09:02:15,400 --> 09:02:15,720
the wished

33521
09:02:15,720 --> 09:02:16,860
for direction.

33522
09:02:16,860 --> 09:02:17,240
They were

33523
09:02:17,240 --> 09:02:18,440
in blank street.

33524
09:02:18,560 --> 09:02:19,560
He saw Wickham

33525
09:02:19,560 --> 09:02:20,880
and afterwards insisted

33526
09:02:20,880 --> 09:02:22,080
on seeing Lydia.

33527
09:02:22,200 --> 09:02:23,340
His first object

33528
09:02:23,340 --> 09:02:23,720
with her,

33529
09:02:23,720 --> 09:02:24,380
he acknowledged,

33530
09:02:24,380 --> 09:02:25,380
had been to persuade her

33531
09:02:25,380 --> 09:02:26,280
to quit, to present

33532
09:02:26,280 --> 09:02:27,480
disgraceful situation

33533
09:02:27,680 --> 09:02:28,940
and return to friend

33534
09:02:28,940 --> 09:02:29,280
as soon as

33535
09:02:29,280 --> 09:02:30,020
they could be prevailed

33536
09:02:30,020 --> 09:02:31,140
on to receive her,

33537
09:02:31,140 --> 09:02:32,360
offering his assistance

33538
09:02:32,360 --> 09:02:33,560
as far as it would go.

33539
09:02:33,920 --> 09:02:34,980
But he found Lydia

33540
09:02:34,980 --> 09:02:36,080
absolutely resolved

33541
09:02:36,080 --> 09:02:36,540
on remaining

33542
09:02:36,540 --> 09:02:37,500
where she was.

33543
09:02:37,500 --> 09:02:38,040
She cared

33544
09:02:38,040 --> 09:02:38,900
none of her friends.

33545
09:02:38,900 --> 09:02:39,440
She wanted

33546
09:02:39,440 --> 09:02:40,500
no help of his.

33547
09:02:40,500 --> 09:02:41,340
She would not hear

33548
09:02:41,340 --> 09:02:42,540
of leaving Wickham.

33549
09:02:42,620 --> 09:02:43,340
She was sure

33550
09:02:43,340 --> 09:02:44,040
they should be married

33551
09:02:44,040 --> 09:02:45,060
sometime, rather.

33552
09:02:45,060 --> 09:02:45,620
And it did not

33553
09:02:45,620 --> 09:02:46,400
much signify.

33554
09:02:46,400 --> 09:02:47,340
When.

33555
09:02:47,340 --> 09:02:47,720
Seems

33556
09:02:47,720 --> 09:02:48,920
such were her feelings.

33557
09:02:49,080 --> 09:02:50,000
It only remained,

33558
09:02:50,000 --> 09:02:50,960
he thought, to secure

33559
09:02:50,960 --> 09:02:52,160
and expedite a marriage,

33560
09:02:52,380 --> 09:02:53,000
which in his very

33561
09:02:53,000 --> 09:02:53,880
first conversation

33562
09:02:53,880 --> 09:02:54,560
with Wickham,

33563
09:02:54,560 --> 09:02:55,580
he easily learned it

33564
09:02:55,580 --> 09:02:56,940
never been his design.

33565
09:02:57,180 --> 09:02:58,280
He Confessed himself

33566
09:02:58,280 --> 09:02:58,820
obliged

33567
09:02:58,820 --> 09:02:59,840
to leave the regiment

33568
09:02:59,840 --> 09:03:00,800
on account of some.

33569
09:03:00,800 --> 09:03:01,580
Debts of honor

33570
09:03:01,580 --> 09:03:02,040
which are very.

33571
09:03:02,040 --> 09:03:03,360
Pressing and scruple

33572
09:03:03,360 --> 09:03:03,920
not to know

33573
09:03:03,920 --> 09:03:05,000
the ill consequences

33574
09:03:05,000 --> 09:03:05,900
of Lydia's flight

33575
09:03:05,900 --> 09:03:07,100
and her own folly alone.

33576
09:03:07,460 --> 09:03:08,340
He meant to resign

33577
09:03:08,340 --> 09:03:08,760
his commission

33578
09:03:08,760 --> 09:03:09,560
immediately

33579
09:03:09,560 --> 09:03:10,500
and asked to his future

33580
09:03:10,500 --> 09:03:11,360
a situation

33581
09:03:11,360 --> 09:03:12,180
He could conjecture

33582
09:03:12,180 --> 09:03:13,380
very little about it.

33583
09:03:13,580 --> 09:03:14,780
He must go somewhere,

33584
09:03:14,940 --> 09:03:15,540
but he did not

33585
09:03:15,540 --> 09:03:16,320
know where.

33586
09:03:16,320 --> 09:03:16,920
And he knew

33587
09:03:16,920 --> 09:03:17,340
he should have

33588
09:03:17,340 --> 09:03:18,300
nothing to live on.

33589
09:03:19,280 --> 09:03:19,580
Mr.

33590
09:03:19,580 --> 09:03:20,820
Darcy asked him why he

33591
09:03:20,820 --> 09:03:21,480
had not married

33592
09:03:21,480 --> 09:03:22,680
your sister at once.

33593
09:03:22,760 --> 09:03:23,340
Though Mr.

33594
09:03:23,340 --> 09:03:24,300
Bennett was not imagined

33595
09:03:24,300 --> 09:03:25,340
to be very rich.

33596
09:03:25,340 --> 09:03:26,160
He would have been able

33597
09:03:26,160 --> 09:03:27,060
to do something.

33598
09:03:27,060 --> 09:03:28,520
Him and his situation

33599
09:03:28,520 --> 09:03:29,060
must have been

33600
09:03:29,060 --> 09:03:30,360
benefited by marriage.

33601
09:03:30,960 --> 09:03:31,860
But he found in

33602
09:03:31,860 --> 09:03:33,060
reply to this question

33603
09:03:33,200 --> 09:03:33,900
that Wickham

33604
09:03:33,900 --> 09:03:34,740
still cherished

33605
09:03:34,740 --> 09:03:35,100
the hope

33606
09:03:35,100 --> 09:03:35,940
of more effectually.

33607
09:03:35,940 --> 09:03:36,900
Making his fortune

33608
09:03:36,900 --> 09:03:37,460
by marriage

33609
09:03:37,460 --> 09:03:38,660
in some other country.

33610
09:03:39,020 --> 09:03:39,320
Under

33611
09:03:39,320 --> 09:03:40,580
such circumstances,

33612
09:03:40,580 --> 09:03:41,220
however,

33613
09:03:41,220 --> 09:03:42,180
he was not likely

33614
09:03:42,180 --> 09:03:42,720
to be proved

33615
09:03:42,720 --> 09:03:43,820
against the temptation

33616
09:03:43,820 --> 09:03:45,020
of immediate relief.

33617
09:03:45,660 --> 09:03:47,040
They met several times,

33618
09:03:47,040 --> 09:03:47,640
but there was much

33619
09:03:47,640 --> 09:03:48,680
to be discussed.

33620
09:03:48,680 --> 09:03:49,640
Wickham, of course,

33621
09:03:49,640 --> 09:03:50,280
wanted more

33622
09:03:50,280 --> 09:03:51,200
than he could get,

33623
09:03:51,200 --> 09:03:51,860
but at length

33624
09:03:51,860 --> 09:03:52,380
was reduced.

33625
09:03:52,380 --> 09:03:53,580
To be reasonable.

33626
09:03:53,780 --> 09:03:54,620
Everything being

33627
09:03:54,620 --> 09:03:55,820
settled between them.

33628
09:03:55,880 --> 09:03:56,240
Mr.

33629
09:03:56,240 --> 09:03:56,720
D'Arcy's

33630
09:03:56,720 --> 09:03:57,920
next step was to make.

33631
09:03:57,920 --> 09:03:58,340
Your uncle

33632
09:03:58,340 --> 09:03:59,460
acquainted with it,

33633
09:03:59,460 --> 09:04:00,560
and he first called

33634
09:04:00,560 --> 09:04:01,620
in Grace Church Street

33635
09:04:01,620 --> 09:04:02,100
the evening

33636
09:04:02,100 --> 09:04:03,300
before I came home.

33637
09:04:03,600 --> 09:04:04,020
But Mr.

33638
09:04:04,020 --> 09:04:04,560
Gardner could

33639
09:04:04,560 --> 09:04:05,540
not be seen.

33640
09:04:05,540 --> 09:04:06,080
At Mr.

33641
09:04:06,080 --> 09:04:07,500
Darcy found on further.

33642
09:04:07,500 --> 09:04:08,180
Inquiry

33643
09:04:08,180 --> 09:04:09,020
that your father

33644
09:04:09,020 --> 09:04:10,260
was still with him, but

33645
09:04:10,260 --> 09:04:10,980
would quit town

33646
09:04:10,980 --> 09:04:12,180
the next morning.

33647
09:04:12,200 --> 09:04:13,140
He did not judge

33648
09:04:13,140 --> 09:04:13,620
your father

33649
09:04:13,620 --> 09:04:14,480
to be a person whom

33650
09:04:14,480 --> 09:04:14,700
he could

33651
09:04:14,700 --> 09:04:15,320
so properly

33652
09:04:15,320 --> 09:04:16,520
consult as your uncle

33653
09:04:16,740 --> 09:04:17,480
and therefore

33654
09:04:17,480 --> 09:04:18,360
readily postpone

33655
09:04:18,360 --> 09:04:18,920
seeing him

33656
09:04:18,920 --> 09:04:19,380
till after

33657
09:04:19,380 --> 09:04:19,940
the departure

33658
09:04:19,940 --> 09:04:21,020
of the former.

33659
09:04:21,020 --> 09:04:21,500
He did not

33660
09:04:21,500 --> 09:04:22,940
leave his name until.

33661
09:04:22,940 --> 09:04:23,600
The next. Day.

33662
09:04:23,600 --> 09:04:24,420
It was only known

33663
09:04:24,420 --> 09:04:25,140
that a gentleman

33664
09:04:25,140 --> 09:04:26,460
had called on business.

33665
09:04:27,600 --> 09:04:28,320
On Saturday

33666
09:04:28,320 --> 09:04:29,100
he came again.

33667
09:04:29,100 --> 09:04:30,240
Your father was gone.

33668
09:04:30,240 --> 09:04:31,320
Your uncle at home.

33669
09:04:31,320 --> 09:04:32,240
And as I said before,

33670
09:04:32,240 --> 09:04:32,720
they had a great

33671
09:04:32,720 --> 09:04:33,920
deal of talk together.

33672
09:04:34,340 --> 09:04:35,640
They met again on Sunday

33673
09:04:35,820 --> 09:04:37,340
and then I saw him too.

33674
09:04:37,520 --> 09:04:38,460
It was not all

33675
09:04:38,460 --> 09:04:39,680
settled before Monday.

33676
09:04:39,920 --> 09:04:40,980
As soon as it was,

33677
09:04:40,980 --> 09:04:41,600
the Express was

33678
09:04:41,600 --> 09:04:42,800
sent off to London.

33679
09:04:43,020 --> 09:04:43,940
But our visitor was

33680
09:04:43,940 --> 09:04:45,140
very obstinate.

33681
09:04:45,200 --> 09:04:46,280
I fancy, Lizzie,

33682
09:04:46,280 --> 09:04:47,180
that obstinacy

33683
09:04:47,180 --> 09:04:48,120
is the real defect

33684
09:04:48,120 --> 09:04:48,780
of his character.

33685
09:04:48,780 --> 09:04:49,700
After all,

33686
09:04:49,700 --> 09:04:50,640
he has been accused

33687
09:04:50,640 --> 09:04:51,360
of many fools

33688
09:04:51,360 --> 09:04:52,400
at different times.

33689
09:04:52,400 --> 09:04:53,220
But this is

33690
09:04:53,220 --> 09:04:54,200
the true one.

33691
09:04:54,200 --> 09:04:55,400
Nothing was to be done

33692
09:04:55,400 --> 09:04:55,740
that he did

33693
09:04:55,740 --> 09:04:56,940
not do himself,

33694
09:04:57,080 --> 09:04:58,280
though I am sure,

33695
09:04:58,280 --> 09:04:59,240
and I do not speak it

33696
09:04:59,240 --> 09:04:59,880
to be thanked.

33697
09:04:59,880 --> 09:05:00,240
Therefore

33698
09:05:00,240 --> 09:05:01,440
say nothing about it.

33699
09:05:01,500 --> 09:05:02,220
Your uncle would

33700
09:05:02,220 --> 09:05:02,880
most readily

33701
09:05:02,880 --> 09:05:04,080
have settled the whole.

33702
09:05:04,320 --> 09:05:05,100
They battled it

33703
09:05:05,100 --> 09:05:05,600
together for

33704
09:05:05,600 --> 09:05:06,420
a long time.

33705
09:05:06,420 --> 09:05:07,100
Which was more

33706
09:05:07,100 --> 09:05:07,580
than either

33707
09:05:07,580 --> 09:05:08,220
the gentleman

33708
09:05:08,220 --> 09:05:09,260
or lady concerned.

33709
09:05:09,260 --> 09:05:10,460
And it deserved.

33710
09:05:10,680 --> 09:05:11,480
But at last

33711
09:05:11,480 --> 09:05:11,840
your uncle

33712
09:05:11,840 --> 09:05:13,020
was forced to yield.

33713
09:05:13,020 --> 09:05:13,880
And instead of being.

33714
09:05:13,880 --> 09:05:14,420
Allowed to be.

33715
09:05:14,420 --> 09:05:15,620
Of use to his niece

33716
09:05:15,660 --> 09:05:16,220
was forced

33717
09:05:16,220 --> 09:05:16,820
to put up with

33718
09:05:16,820 --> 09:05:17,340
only having

33719
09:05:17,340 --> 09:05:17,840
the probable

33720
09:05:17,840 --> 09:05:18,860
credit of it,

33721
09:05:18,860 --> 09:05:19,280
which went

33722
09:05:19,280 --> 09:05:20,040
solely against

33723
09:05:20,040 --> 09:05:20,760
the grain.

33724
09:05:20,760 --> 09:05:21,660
And I really believe

33725
09:05:21,660 --> 09:05:22,520
your letter this morning

33726
09:05:22,520 --> 09:05:23,720
gave him great pleasure

33727
09:05:23,960 --> 09:05:24,720
because it required

33728
09:05:24,720 --> 09:05:25,460
an explanation

33729
09:05:25,460 --> 09:05:26,120
that had robbed him

33730
09:05:26,120 --> 09:05:27,300
of his borrowed feathers

33731
09:05:27,300 --> 09:05:28,200
and gave the praise

33732
09:05:28,200 --> 09:05:29,400
where it was due.

33733
09:05:29,460 --> 09:05:30,360
But, Lizzie,

33734
09:05:30,360 --> 09:05:31,020
this must go

33735
09:05:31,020 --> 09:05:32,460
no farther than yourself

33736
09:05:32,720 --> 09:05:33,920
or Jane at most.

33737
09:05:34,400 --> 09:05:35,480
You know pretty well,

33738
09:05:35,480 --> 09:05:36,120
I suppose,

33739
09:05:36,120 --> 09:05:36,900
what is being done

33740
09:05:36,900 --> 09:05:38,100
for the young people.

33741
09:05:38,100 --> 09:05:39,080
His debts are to be

33742
09:05:39,080 --> 09:05:40,320
paid amounting,

33743
09:05:40,320 --> 09:05:40,860
I believe, to

33744
09:05:40,860 --> 09:05:41,760
considerably more

33745
09:05:41,760 --> 09:05:42,960
than ?1,000.

33746
09:05:43,040 --> 09:05:43,940
Another thousand,

33747
09:05:43,940 --> 09:05:44,760
in addition to her own,

33748
09:05:44,760 --> 09:05:45,380
settled upon

33749
09:05:45,380 --> 09:05:46,800
her and his commission

33750
09:05:46,800 --> 09:05:47,780
purchased.

33751
09:05:47,780 --> 09:05:48,860
The reason why all

33752
09:05:48,860 --> 09:05:49,320
this was

33753
09:05:49,320 --> 09:05:50,600
to be done by him alone

33754
09:05:50,720 --> 09:05:51,600
was such as I have

33755
09:05:51,600 --> 09:05:52,680
given above.

33756
09:05:52,680 --> 09:05:53,880
It was owing to him,

33757
09:05:54,080 --> 09:05:55,020
to his reserve

33758
09:05:55,020 --> 09:05:55,760
and want of proper

33759
09:05:55,760 --> 09:05:56,760
consideration

33760
09:05:56,760 --> 09:05:57,840
that Wickham's character

33761
09:05:57,840 --> 09:05:58,200
had been

33762
09:05:58,200 --> 09:05:59,400
so misunderstood

33763
09:05:59,420 --> 09:06:00,420
and consequently

33764
09:06:00,420 --> 09:06:00,720
that he had

33765
09:06:00,720 --> 09:06:01,440
been received

33766
09:06:01,440 --> 09:06:02,900
and noticed he was.

33767
09:06:03,440 --> 09:06:04,240
Perhaps there was

33768
09:06:04,240 --> 09:06:05,440
some truth in this,

33769
09:06:05,580 --> 09:06:05,840
though

33770
09:06:05,840 --> 09:06:06,320
I doubt

33771
09:06:06,320 --> 09:06:07,340
whether his reserve

33772
09:06:07,340 --> 09:06:07,920
or anybody's

33773
09:06:07,920 --> 09:06:08,480
reserve

33774
09:06:08,480 --> 09:06:09,440
can be answerable.

33775
09:06:09,440 --> 09:06:10,500
For the event.

33776
09:06:10,500 --> 09:06:11,720
But in spite of all

33777
09:06:11,720 --> 09:06:12,920
this talking,

33778
09:06:13,040 --> 09:06:14,240
my dear Lizzie,

33779
09:06:14,280 --> 09:06:14,960
you may rest

33780
09:06:14,960 --> 09:06:16,160
perfectly assured that

33781
09:06:16,160 --> 09:06:16,720
your uncle would

33782
09:06:16,720 --> 09:06:17,940
never have yielded

33783
09:06:18,000 --> 09:06:19,000
if we had not given him

33784
09:06:19,000 --> 09:06:19,800
credit for.

33785
09:06:19,800 --> 09:06:20,860
Another interest

33786
09:06:20,860 --> 09:06:22,080
in the affair.

33787
09:06:22,360 --> 09:06:23,120
When all this was

33788
09:06:23,120 --> 09:06:24,020
resolved, he.

33789
09:06:24,020 --> 09:06:24,440
Returned.

33790
09:06:24,440 --> 09:06:25,580
Again to his friends.

33791
09:06:25,580 --> 09:06:26,120
Who was still

33792
09:06:26,120 --> 09:06:27,320
staying at Pemberley.

33793
09:06:27,680 --> 09:06:28,460
But it was agreed

33794
09:06:28,460 --> 09:06:28,940
that he should be

33795
09:06:28,940 --> 09:06:30,080
in London once more.

33796
09:06:30,080 --> 09:06:30,600
When the wedding

33797
09:06:30,600 --> 09:06:31,460
took place

33798
09:06:31,460 --> 09:06:32,580
and all money matters.

33799
09:06:32,580 --> 09:06:32,960
Were then to

33800
09:06:32,960 --> 09:06:33,780
receive the last.

33801
09:06:33,780 --> 09:06:34,220
Finish.

33802
09:06:35,420 --> 09:06:36,420
I believe I have now

33803
09:06:36,420 --> 09:06:37,620
told you everything.

33804
09:06:37,920 --> 09:06:38,820
It is a relation

33805
09:06:38,820 --> 09:06:39,500
which you tell me

33806
09:06:39,500 --> 09:06:40,000
is to give you

33807
09:06:40,000 --> 09:06:41,200
a great surprise.

33808
09:06:41,400 --> 09:06:42,300
I hope at least it will

33809
09:06:42,300 --> 09:06:43,040
not afford you

33810
09:06:43,040 --> 09:06:44,220
any displeasure.

33811
09:06:44,220 --> 09:06:45,740
Lydia came to us and.

33812
09:06:45,740 --> 09:06:46,880
Wickham had constant

33813
09:06:46,880 --> 09:06:48,080
admission to the house.

33814
09:06:48,320 --> 09:06:49,400
He was exactly

33815
09:06:49,400 --> 09:06:50,180
what he had been

33816
09:06:50,180 --> 09:06:50,640
when I knew him

33817
09:06:50,640 --> 09:06:51,800
in Hertfordshire.

33818
09:06:51,800 --> 09:06:52,820
But I would not tell you

33819
09:06:52,820 --> 09:06:53,240
how little

33820
09:06:53,240 --> 09:06:53,460
I was

33821
09:06:53,460 --> 09:06:54,120
satisfied with

33822
09:06:54,120 --> 09:06:54,860
her behavior

33823
09:06:54,860 --> 09:06:55,160
while she

33824
09:06:55,160 --> 09:06:56,180
stayed with us.

33825
09:06:56,180 --> 09:06:57,420
If I had not perceived

33826
09:06:57,420 --> 09:06:58,000
by Jane's

33827
09:06:58,000 --> 09:06:59,240
letter last Wednesday

33828
09:06:59,460 --> 09:07:00,540
that her conduct on

33829
09:07:00,540 --> 09:07:01,100
coming home

33830
09:07:01,100 --> 09:07:01,760
was exactly

33831
09:07:01,760 --> 09:07:02,960
of a peace with it,

33832
09:07:03,080 --> 09:07:03,800
and therefore

33833
09:07:03,800 --> 09:07:04,500
what I now tell

33834
09:07:04,500 --> 09:07:05,040
you can give you

33835
09:07:05,040 --> 09:07:06,240
no fresh pain.

33836
09:07:06,600 --> 09:07:07,360
I talked to her

33837
09:07:07,360 --> 09:07:08,000
repeatedly

33838
09:07:08,000 --> 09:07:08,460
in the most

33839
09:07:08,460 --> 09:07:09,620
serious manner,

33840
09:07:09,620 --> 09:07:10,700
representing to her,

33841
09:07:10,700 --> 09:07:11,600
all the wickedness

33842
09:07:11,600 --> 09:07:12,620
of what she had done

33843
09:07:12,620 --> 09:07:13,680
and all the unhappiness

33844
09:07:13,680 --> 09:07:13,920
she had

33845
09:07:13,920 --> 09:07:15,120
brought in a family.

33846
09:07:15,260 --> 09:07:16,460
If she heard me,

33847
09:07:16,540 --> 09:07:18,140
it was by good luck, for

33848
09:07:18,140 --> 09:07:18,820
I am sure she did

33849
09:07:18,820 --> 09:07:19,980
not listen.

33850
09:07:19,980 --> 09:07:20,680
I was sometimes

33851
09:07:20,680 --> 09:07:21,900
quite provoked.

33852
09:07:22,180 --> 09:07:23,300
But then I recollected

33853
09:07:23,300 --> 09:07:23,780
my dear.

33854
09:07:23,780 --> 09:07:24,980
Elizabeth and Jane,

33855
09:07:25,100 --> 09:07:26,160
and for their sakes,

33856
09:07:26,160 --> 09:07:27,260
had. Patience with her.

33857
09:07:28,280 --> 09:07:28,640
Mr.

33858
09:07:28,640 --> 09:07:29,180
Darcy was

33859
09:07:29,180 --> 09:07:30,380
punctual in his return,

33860
09:07:30,540 --> 09:07:31,660
and as Lady informed,

33861
09:07:31,660 --> 09:07:32,180
you attended

33862
09:07:32,180 --> 09:07:33,020
the wedding.

33863
09:07:33,020 --> 09:07:33,660
He dined with.

33864
09:07:33,660 --> 09:07:34,280
Us the next.

33865
09:07:34,280 --> 09:07:35,580
Day and was to leave

33866
09:07:35,600 --> 09:07:36,780
town again on Wednesday

33867
09:07:36,780 --> 09:07:37,980
or Thursday.

33868
09:07:38,280 --> 09:07:39,480
Will you be very angry

33869
09:07:39,480 --> 09:07:40,680
with me, my dear Lizzie,

33870
09:07:40,800 --> 09:07:41,400
if I take

33871
09:07:41,400 --> 09:07:42,120
this opportunity

33872
09:07:42,120 --> 09:07:43,100
of saying what

33873
09:07:43,100 --> 09:07:43,980
I was never bold enough

33874
09:07:43,980 --> 09:07:45,140
to say before.

33875
09:07:45,140 --> 09:07:46,460
How much I like him.

33876
09:07:46,940 --> 09:07:47,760
His behavior

33877
09:07:47,760 --> 09:07:48,080
to us

33878
09:07:48,080 --> 09:07:49,440
has in every respect

33879
09:07:49,440 --> 09:07:50,240
been as pleasing

33880
09:07:50,240 --> 09:07:50,660
as when we were

33881
09:07:50,660 --> 09:07:51,800
in Derbyshire.

33882
09:07:51,800 --> 09:07:52,860
His understanding

33883
09:07:52,860 --> 09:07:53,460
and opinions

33884
09:07:53,460 --> 09:07:54,660
all please me.

33885
09:07:54,920 --> 09:07:55,760
He wants nothing

33886
09:07:55,760 --> 09:07:55,940
but a

33887
09:07:55,940 --> 09:07:57,140
little more liveliness

33888
09:07:57,320 --> 09:07:58,320
and that if he

33889
09:07:58,320 --> 09:07:59,520
marry prudently,

33890
09:07:59,640 --> 09:08:01,040
his wife may teach him.

33891
09:08:01,620 --> 09:08:03,320
I thought him very sly.

33892
09:08:03,500 --> 09:08:04,360
He hardly ever

33893
09:08:04,360 --> 09:08:05,580
mentioned your name,

33894
09:08:06,020 --> 09:08:06,900
but slyness

33895
09:08:06,900 --> 09:08:08,100
seems the fashion.

33896
09:08:08,300 --> 09:08:09,200
Pray forgive me.

33897
09:08:09,200 --> 09:08:09,740
If I have been

33898
09:08:09,740 --> 09:08:10,940
very presuming,

33899
09:08:10,940 --> 09:08:11,500
or at least

33900
09:08:11,500 --> 09:08:12,820
do not punish me so far

33901
09:08:12,820 --> 09:08:13,040
as to

33902
09:08:13,040 --> 09:08:14,240
exclude me from me.

33903
09:08:14,540 --> 09:08:15,480
I shall never be

33904
09:08:15,480 --> 09:08:16,680
quite happy to live.

33905
09:08:16,680 --> 09:08:18,120
Been all round the park.

33906
09:08:18,500 --> 09:08:19,520
A low

33907
09:08:19,520 --> 09:08:19,720
with a

33908
09:08:19,720 --> 09:08:20,300
nice little

33909
09:08:20,300 --> 09:08:21,040
pair of ponies

33910
09:08:21,040 --> 09:08:22,280
would be the very thing.

33911
09:08:23,000 --> 09:08:24,180
But I must try to know

33912
09:08:24,180 --> 09:08:24,660
more.

33913
09:08:24,660 --> 09:08:25,500
The children have been.

33914
09:08:25,500 --> 09:08:26,420
Wanting me this half.

33915
09:08:26,420 --> 09:08:27,360
Hour.

33916
09:08:27,360 --> 09:08:28,800
Yours very sincerely.

33917
09:08:29,120 --> 09:08:30,220
Am gardener.

33918
09:08:31,980 --> 09:08:32,940
The contents of this

33919
09:08:32,940 --> 09:08:34,040
letter threw Elizabeth

33920
09:08:34,040 --> 09:08:34,340
into a

33921
09:08:34,340 --> 09:08:35,540
flutter of spirits

33922
09:08:35,640 --> 09:08:36,000
in which

33923
09:08:36,000 --> 09:08:36,660
it was difficult

33924
09:08:36,660 --> 09:08:37,260
to determine

33925
09:08:37,260 --> 09:08:37,920
whether pleasure

33926
09:08:37,920 --> 09:08:38,720
or pain.

33927
09:08:38,720 --> 09:08:39,920
The greatest share.

33928
09:08:40,100 --> 09:08:40,640
The vague

33929
09:08:40,640 --> 09:08:42,020
and unsettled suspicions

33930
09:08:42,020 --> 09:08:42,800
which uncertainty

33931
09:08:42,800 --> 09:08:44,180
had produced of what Mr.

33932
09:08:44,180 --> 09:08:44,760
Darcy might

33933
09:08:44,760 --> 09:08:45,380
have been doing

33934
09:08:45,380 --> 09:08:45,980
to forward her

33935
09:08:45,980 --> 09:08:47,060
sister's match.

33936
09:08:47,060 --> 09:08:47,660
Which she had.

33937
09:08:47,660 --> 09:08:48,660
Feared to encourage

33938
09:08:48,660 --> 09:08:49,340
as an exertion

33939
09:08:49,340 --> 09:08:49,880
of goodness.

33940
09:08:49,880 --> 09:08:51,120
Too great to be probable

33941
09:08:51,380 --> 09:08:52,400
and at the same time

33942
09:08:52,400 --> 09:08:53,860
dreaded to be just from

33943
09:08:53,860 --> 09:08:55,080
the pain of obligation.

33944
09:08:55,220 --> 09:08:55,820
Were proved.

33945
09:08:55,820 --> 09:08:56,640
Beyond their greatest

33946
09:08:56,640 --> 09:08:57,860
extent to be true.

33947
09:08:58,320 --> 09:08:59,280
He had followed them

33948
09:08:59,280 --> 09:09:00,480
purposely to town.

33949
09:09:00,560 --> 09:09:01,760
He had taken on himself.

33950
09:09:01,760 --> 09:09:02,580
All the trouble

33951
09:09:02,580 --> 09:09:03,500
and mortification

33952
09:09:03,500 --> 09:09:04,080
attended on

33953
09:09:04,080 --> 09:09:05,280
such a research.

33954
09:09:05,300 --> 09:09:05,680
In which

33955
09:09:05,680 --> 09:09:06,500
supplication had.

33956
09:09:06,500 --> 09:09:07,220
Been necessary

33957
09:09:07,220 --> 09:09:07,700
to a woman

33958
09:09:07,700 --> 09:09:08,120
whom he must

33959
09:09:08,120 --> 09:09:09,540
abomination, despise

33960
09:09:09,820 --> 09:09:10,500
and where he was.

33961
09:09:10,500 --> 09:09:11,580
Reduced to meet

33962
09:09:11,580 --> 09:09:12,660
frequently meet

33963
09:09:12,660 --> 09:09:14,000
reason with persuade.

33964
09:09:14,000 --> 09:09:15,220
And finally bribe.

33965
09:09:15,260 --> 09:09:16,520
The man whom he always

33966
09:09:16,520 --> 09:09:17,780
most wished to avoid,

33967
09:09:18,000 --> 09:09:18,660
whose very name

33968
09:09:18,660 --> 09:09:19,460
it was punishment to.

33969
09:09:19,460 --> 09:09:20,640
Him to pronounce.

33970
09:09:20,640 --> 09:09:22,000
He had done all this

33971
09:09:22,000 --> 09:09:22,620
for a girl

33972
09:09:22,620 --> 09:09:23,040
whom he could

33973
09:09:23,040 --> 09:09:23,900
neither regard

33974
09:09:23,900 --> 09:09:25,100
nor esteem.

33975
09:09:25,360 --> 09:09:26,580
Her heart did whisper

33976
09:09:26,580 --> 09:09:26,840
that he had

33977
09:09:26,840 --> 09:09:28,000
done it for her,

33978
09:09:28,000 --> 09:09:28,800
but it was a hope.

33979
09:09:28,800 --> 09:09:29,640
Shortly checked

33980
09:09:29,640 --> 09:09:30,960
by other considerations.

33981
09:09:31,260 --> 09:09:31,920
And she soon.

33982
09:09:31,920 --> 09:09:32,660
Felt that even

33983
09:09:32,660 --> 09:09:33,260
her vanity

33984
09:09:33,260 --> 09:09:34,180
was insufficient

33985
09:09:34,180 --> 09:09:35,300
when required to depend

33986
09:09:35,300 --> 09:09:36,000
on his affection

33987
09:09:36,000 --> 09:09:36,720
for her.

33988
09:09:36,720 --> 09:09:37,320
For a woman

33989
09:09:37,320 --> 09:09:37,520
who had

33990
09:09:37,520 --> 09:09:38,720
already refused him

33991
09:09:38,860 --> 09:09:39,380
as able

33992
09:09:39,380 --> 09:09:39,920
to overcome

33993
09:09:39,920 --> 09:09:40,460
a sentiment

33994
09:09:40,460 --> 09:09:41,160
so natural

33995
09:09:41,160 --> 09:09:42,220
as abhorrence against.

33996
09:09:42,220 --> 09:09:42,860
Relationship

33997
09:09:42,860 --> 09:09:43,820
with Wickham.

33998
09:09:43,820 --> 09:09:44,460
Brother in.

33999
09:09:44,460 --> 09:09:45,660
Law of Wickham.

34000
09:09:45,900 --> 09:09:47,000
Every kind of.

34001
09:09:47,000 --> 09:09:48,220
Pride must revolt

34002
09:09:48,220 --> 09:09:49,440
from the connection.

34003
09:09:49,680 --> 09:09:50,460
He had to be

34004
09:09:50,460 --> 09:09:51,660
sure done much.

34005
09:09:51,920 --> 09:09:53,120
She was ashamed to think

34006
09:09:53,120 --> 09:09:54,560
how much, but he had.

34007
09:09:54,560 --> 09:09:55,320
Given a reason

34008
09:09:55,320 --> 09:09:56,420
for his interference,

34009
09:09:56,420 --> 09:09:57,860
which no extraordinary

34010
09:09:57,860 --> 09:09:59,060
stretch of belief.

34011
09:09:59,320 --> 09:10:00,220
It was reasonable

34012
09:10:00,220 --> 09:10:00,820
that he should feel

34013
09:10:00,820 --> 09:10:01,860
he had been wrong.

34014
09:10:01,860 --> 09:10:03,040
He had liberality

34015
09:10:03,040 --> 09:10:03,800
and he had the means

34016
09:10:03,800 --> 09:10:04,940
of exercising it.

34017
09:10:04,940 --> 09:10:05,600
And though she would.

34018
09:10:05,600 --> 09:10:06,660
Not place herself

34019
09:10:06,660 --> 09:10:07,220
his principal

34020
09:10:07,220 --> 09:10:08,160
inducement,

34021
09:10:08,160 --> 09:10:08,580
she could

34022
09:10:08,580 --> 09:10:09,480
perhaps believe

34023
09:10:09,480 --> 09:10:10,100
that remaining

34024
09:10:10,100 --> 09:10:11,180
partiality for her

34025
09:10:11,180 --> 09:10:11,720
might assist

34026
09:10:11,720 --> 09:10:12,800
his endeavors in a cause

34027
09:10:12,800 --> 09:10:13,800
where her peace of mind

34028
09:10:13,800 --> 09:10:14,100
must be

34029
09:10:14,100 --> 09:10:15,300
materially concerned.

34030
09:10:15,920 --> 09:10:17,000
It was painful,

34031
09:10:17,000 --> 09:10:18,380
exceedingly painful

34032
09:10:18,380 --> 09:10:18,780
to know

34033
09:10:18,780 --> 09:10:19,160
that they were

34034
09:10:19,160 --> 09:10:20,120
under obligations

34035
09:10:20,120 --> 09:10:20,660
to a person

34036
09:10:20,660 --> 09:10:21,620
who could never receive

34037
09:10:21,620 --> 09:10:22,720
a return.

34038
09:10:22,720 --> 09:10:23,180
They owed

34039
09:10:23,180 --> 09:10:24,000
the restoration.

34040
09:10:24,000 --> 09:10:25,520
Of Lydia, her character,

34041
09:10:25,520 --> 09:10:26,720
everything to him.

34042
09:10:27,320 --> 09:10:27,960
Oh, how.

34043
09:10:27,960 --> 09:10:28,460
Heartily

34044
09:10:28,460 --> 09:10:29,320
did she grieve over

34045
09:10:29,320 --> 09:10:30,360
every ungracious

34046
09:10:30,360 --> 09:10:30,900
sensation

34047
09:10:30,900 --> 09:10:32,100
she had ever encouraged.

34048
09:10:32,320 --> 09:10:33,680
Every saucy speech.

34049
09:10:33,680 --> 09:10:34,680
She had ever directed

34050
09:10:34,680 --> 09:10:35,880
towards. Him?

34051
09:10:35,940 --> 09:10:37,040
For herself was.

34052
09:10:37,040 --> 09:10:37,880
Humbled.

34053
09:10:37,880 --> 09:10:38,720
But she was

34054
09:10:38,720 --> 09:10:39,920
proud of him.

34055
09:10:39,980 --> 09:10:40,440
Proud

34056
09:10:40,440 --> 09:10:41,180
that in a cause

34057
09:10:41,180 --> 09:10:42,380
of compassion and honor,

34058
09:10:42,560 --> 09:10:43,260
he had been able

34059
09:10:43,260 --> 09:10:43,520
to get

34060
09:10:43,520 --> 09:10:44,720
the better of himself.

34061
09:10:45,040 --> 09:10:45,860
She read over her

34062
09:10:45,860 --> 09:10:46,820
aunt's commendation

34063
09:10:46,820 --> 09:10:48,080
of him again and again.

34064
09:10:48,540 --> 09:10:49,740
It was hardly enough.

34065
09:10:50,000 --> 09:10:51,200
But it pleased her.

34066
09:10:51,540 --> 09:10:52,160
She was even.

34067
09:10:52,160 --> 09:10:52,640
Sensible

34068
09:10:52,640 --> 09:10:53,860
of some pleasure, though

34069
09:10:53,860 --> 09:10:55,080
mixed with regret

34070
09:10:55,080 --> 09:10:55,720
on finding

34071
09:10:55,720 --> 09:10:57,420
how steadfastly she and

34072
09:10:57,420 --> 09:10:57,860
her uncle

34073
09:10:57,860 --> 09:10:58,680
had been persuaded

34074
09:10:58,680 --> 09:10:59,300
that affection

34075
09:10:59,300 --> 09:11:00,540
and confidence subsisted

34076
09:11:00,540 --> 09:11:01,100
between Mr.

34077
09:11:01,100 --> 09:11:02,300
Darcy and herself.

34078
09:11:02,680 --> 09:11:03,720
She was roused from her

34079
09:11:03,720 --> 09:11:04,940
seat and her reflections

34080
09:11:04,940 --> 09:11:06,140
by someone's approach

34081
09:11:06,300 --> 09:11:06,800
and Before

34082
09:11:06,800 --> 09:11:07,440
she could strike

34083
09:11:07,440 --> 09:11:08,500
into another path,

34084
09:11:08,500 --> 09:11:09,660
she was overtaken

34085
09:11:09,660 --> 09:11:10,860
by Wickham.

34086
09:11:11,220 --> 09:11:11,840
I am afraid

34087
09:11:11,840 --> 09:11:12,380
I interrupt

34088
09:11:12,380 --> 09:11:13,360
your solitary ramble,

34089
09:11:13,360 --> 09:11:14,560
my dear sister.

34090
09:11:14,720 --> 09:11:15,220
Said he,

34091
09:11:15,220 --> 09:11:16,440
as he joined her.

34092
09:11:16,680 --> 09:11:17,880
You certainly do.

34093
09:11:18,080 --> 09:11:18,720
She replied

34094
09:11:18,720 --> 09:11:19,760
with a smile.

34095
09:11:19,760 --> 09:11:20,240
But it does

34096
09:11:20,240 --> 09:11:20,940
not follow that

34097
09:11:20,940 --> 09:11:21,660
the interruption

34098
09:11:21,660 --> 09:11:22,920
must be unwelcome.

34099
09:11:24,220 --> 09:11:25,040
I should be sorry.

34100
09:11:25,040 --> 09:11:26,160
Indeed, if it were,

34101
09:11:26,160 --> 09:11:26,780
we were always

34102
09:11:26,780 --> 09:11:27,300
good friends.

34103
09:11:27,300 --> 09:11:28,500
And now we are better.

34104
09:11:30,180 --> 09:11:31,040
True.

34105
09:11:31,040 --> 09:11:31,680
Are the others

34106
09:11:31,680 --> 09:11:32,680
coming out?

34107
09:11:32,680 --> 09:11:33,660
I do not know.

34108
09:11:33,660 --> 09:11:33,960
Mrs.

34109
09:11:33,960 --> 09:11:34,720
Bennett and Lydia

34110
09:11:34,720 --> 09:11:35,060
are going

34111
09:11:35,060 --> 09:11:35,660
in the carriage

34112
09:11:35,660 --> 09:11:36,860
to Meriton.

34113
09:11:36,960 --> 09:11:38,060
And so, my dear sister,

34114
09:11:38,060 --> 09:11:39,220
I find from my uncle

34115
09:11:39,220 --> 09:11:39,800
and aunt

34116
09:11:39,800 --> 09:11:40,280
that you have

34117
09:11:40,280 --> 09:11:41,500
actually seen Pemberley.

34118
09:11:42,260 --> 09:11:42,960
She replied

34119
09:11:42,960 --> 09:11:44,160
in the affirmative.

34120
09:11:44,420 --> 09:11:45,560
I almost envy you

34121
09:11:45,560 --> 09:11:46,400
the pleasure.

34122
09:11:46,400 --> 09:11:47,300
And yet I believe

34123
09:11:47,300 --> 09:11:47,680
it would be

34124
09:11:47,680 --> 09:11:48,900
too much for me.

34125
09:11:48,900 --> 09:11:50,040
Or else I could take it

34126
09:11:50,040 --> 09:11:51,240
in my way to Newcastle.

34127
09:11:51,860 --> 09:11:52,540
And you saw the

34128
09:11:52,540 --> 09:11:53,280
old housekeeper,

34129
09:11:53,280 --> 09:11:54,360
I suppose.

34130
09:11:54,360 --> 09:11:54,900
Poor Reynolds.

34131
09:11:54,900 --> 09:11:56,460
She was very fond of me.

34132
09:11:56,720 --> 09:11:57,300
But of course,

34133
09:11:57,300 --> 09:11:58,040
she did not mention

34134
09:11:58,040 --> 09:11:59,240
my name to you.

34135
09:11:59,480 --> 09:12:00,740
Yes, she did.

34136
09:12:01,940 --> 09:12:03,140
And what did she say?

34137
09:12:03,820 --> 09:12:04,880
That you were gone into.

34138
09:12:04,880 --> 09:12:05,780
The army.

34139
09:12:05,780 --> 09:12:06,760
And she was afraid.

34140
09:12:06,760 --> 09:12:09,080
Had not turned out well

34141
09:12:09,960 --> 09:12:11,160
at such a distance

34142
09:12:11,160 --> 09:12:11,600
as that.

34143
09:12:11,600 --> 09:12:11,900
You know,

34144
09:12:11,900 --> 09:12:12,320
things are

34145
09:12:12,320 --> 09:12:12,860
strangely

34146
09:12:12,860 --> 09:12:14,060
misrepresented.

34147
09:12:14,640 --> 09:12:15,540
Certainly.

34148
09:12:15,540 --> 09:12:16,180
He replied,

34149
09:12:16,180 --> 09:12:17,400
biting his lips.

34150
09:12:17,660 --> 09:12:18,420
Elizabeth hoped

34151
09:12:18,420 --> 09:12:19,620
she had silenced him.

34152
09:12:19,680 --> 09:12:20,720
But he soon afterwards

34153
09:12:20,720 --> 09:12:21,920
said.

34154
09:12:21,960 --> 09:12:22,980
I was surprised to see

34155
09:12:22,980 --> 09:12:23,760
Darcy in town

34156
09:12:23,760 --> 09:12:24,660
last month.

34157
09:12:24,660 --> 09:12:25,580
We passed each other

34158
09:12:25,580 --> 09:12:26,680
several times.

34159
09:12:26,680 --> 09:12:27,660
I wonder what he can be

34160
09:12:27,660 --> 09:12:28,220
doing there.

34161
09:12:29,540 --> 09:12:30,020
Perhaps

34162
09:12:30,020 --> 09:12:30,680
preparing for his

34163
09:12:30,680 --> 09:12:31,460
marriage with Mr.

34164
09:12:31,460 --> 09:12:32,860
Berg, said Elizabeth.

34165
09:12:33,300 --> 09:12:33,960
It must be

34166
09:12:33,960 --> 09:12:35,000
something particular

34167
09:12:35,000 --> 09:12:35,580
to take him there

34168
09:12:35,580 --> 09:12:36,780
at this time of year.

34169
09:12:37,180 --> 09:12:38,220
Undoubtedly.

34170
09:12:38,220 --> 09:12:38,820
Did you see him

34171
09:12:38,820 --> 09:12:39,320
while you were

34172
09:12:39,320 --> 09:12:40,000
at Lambton?

34173
09:12:40,000 --> 09:12:40,980
I thought I understood

34174
09:12:40,980 --> 09:12:41,720
from the gardeners

34175
09:12:41,720 --> 09:12:42,920
that you had.

34176
09:12:43,260 --> 09:12:43,720
Yes.

34177
09:12:43,720 --> 09:12:44,360
He introduced us

34178
09:12:44,360 --> 09:12:45,560
to his sister.

34179
09:12:45,960 --> 09:12:47,160
And do you like her?

34180
09:12:47,600 --> 09:12:48,800
Very much.

34181
09:12:49,220 --> 09:12:49,720
I have heard

34182
09:12:49,720 --> 09:12:50,220
indeed, that

34183
09:12:50,220 --> 09:12:50,460
she is

34184
09:12:50,460 --> 09:12:51,480
uncommonly improved

34185
09:12:51,480 --> 09:12:52,680
within this year or two.

34186
09:12:52,820 --> 09:12:53,760
When I last saw her,

34187
09:12:53,760 --> 09:12:54,960
she not very promising.

34188
09:12:55,220 --> 09:12:56,000
I'm very glad

34189
09:12:56,000 --> 09:12:56,900
you liked her.

34190
09:12:56,900 --> 09:12:57,820
I hope she will turn out

34191
09:12:57,820 --> 09:12:59,040
well.

34192
09:12:59,480 --> 09:13:00,680
I daresay she will.

34193
09:13:00,960 --> 09:13:01,720
She has got over

34194
09:13:01,720 --> 09:13:03,380
the most trying age.

34195
09:13:04,080 --> 09:13:04,700
Did you go by

34196
09:13:04,700 --> 09:13:05,900
the village of Kimpton?

34197
09:13:08,160 --> 09:13:09,020
I do not recollect

34198
09:13:09,020 --> 09:13:10,220
that we did.

34199
09:13:10,700 --> 09:13:11,300
I mention it

34200
09:13:11,300 --> 09:13:12,380
because it is the living

34201
09:13:12,380 --> 09:13:12,920
which I ought

34202
09:13:12,920 --> 09:13:13,180
to have

34203
09:13:13,180 --> 09:13:14,160
had the most

34204
09:13:14,160 --> 09:13:15,220
delightful place.

34205
09:13:15,220 --> 09:13:15,860
Excellent

34206
09:13:15,860 --> 09:13:17,060
parsonage house.

34207
09:13:17,320 --> 09:13:18,260
It would have suited me

34208
09:13:18,260 --> 09:13:19,460
in every respect.

34209
09:13:19,880 --> 09:13:20,860
How would you have liked

34210
09:13:20,860 --> 09:13:22,080
making sermons?

34211
09:13:22,440 --> 09:13:23,680
Exceedingly well.

34212
09:13:24,000 --> 09:13:24,420
I should have

34213
09:13:24,420 --> 09:13:25,040
considered it

34214
09:13:25,040 --> 09:13:26,260
as part of my duty

34215
09:13:26,280 --> 09:13:27,540
and the exertion soon

34216
09:13:27,540 --> 09:13:28,740
have been nothing.

34217
09:13:29,120 --> 09:13:30,360
One ought not to opine.

34218
09:13:31,320 --> 09:13:31,760
But to be

34219
09:13:31,760 --> 09:13:32,460
sure, it would have

34220
09:13:32,460 --> 09:13:33,220
been such a thing

34221
09:13:33,220 --> 09:13:33,900
for me.

34222
09:13:33,900 --> 09:13:34,720
The quiet,

34223
09:13:34,720 --> 09:13:35,780
the retirement of such

34224
09:13:35,780 --> 09:13:36,540
a life

34225
09:13:36,540 --> 09:13:37,280
would have answered

34226
09:13:37,280 --> 09:13:38,120
all my ideas

34227
09:13:38,120 --> 09:13:39,300
of happiness.

34228
09:13:39,300 --> 09:13:40,500
But it was not to be.

34229
09:13:41,060 --> 09:13:41,840
Did you ever hear

34230
09:13:41,840 --> 09:13:42,560
Darcy mention

34231
09:13:42,560 --> 09:13:43,360
the circumstance

34232
09:13:43,360 --> 09:13:44,580
when you were in Kent?

34233
09:13:45,180 --> 09:13:45,920
I have heard

34234
09:13:45,920 --> 09:13:46,760
from authority.

34235
09:13:46,760 --> 09:13:47,960
I thought as good

34236
09:13:48,180 --> 09:13:48,820
that it was left

34237
09:13:48,820 --> 09:13:50,220
you conditionally only,

34238
09:13:50,220 --> 09:13:51,000
and at the will of

34239
09:13:51,000 --> 09:13:52,200
the present patron

34240
09:13:52,320 --> 09:13:53,420
you have. Yes.

34241
09:13:53,420 --> 09:13:53,660
There was

34242
09:13:53,660 --> 09:13:54,680
something in that.

34243
09:13:54,680 --> 09:13:55,520
I told you so

34244
09:13:55,520 --> 09:13:56,320
from the first

34245
09:13:56,320 --> 09:13:57,540
you may remember.

34246
09:13:57,600 --> 09:13:58,880
I did hear, too, that

34247
09:13:58,880 --> 09:13:59,660
that was a time

34248
09:13:59,660 --> 09:14:00,660
when sermon making

34249
09:14:00,660 --> 09:14:01,800
was not so palatable

34250
09:14:01,800 --> 09:14:02,100
to you,

34251
09:14:02,100 --> 09:14:02,780
as it seems to be

34252
09:14:02,780 --> 09:14:03,740
at present,

34253
09:14:03,740 --> 09:14:04,100
that you

34254
09:14:04,100 --> 09:14:04,980
actually declared

34255
09:14:04,980 --> 09:14:05,600
your resolution

34256
09:14:05,600 --> 09:14:06,800
of never taking

34257
09:14:07,000 --> 09:14:08,040
and that the business

34258
09:14:08,040 --> 09:14:09,180
had been compromised

34259
09:14:09,180 --> 09:14:10,380
accordingly.

34260
09:14:10,640 --> 09:14:11,580
You did.

34261
09:14:11,580 --> 09:14:12,420
And it was not wholly

34262
09:14:12,420 --> 09:14:13,620
without foundation.

34263
09:14:13,720 --> 09:14:14,420
You may remember

34264
09:14:14,420 --> 09:14:15,020
what I told you

34265
09:14:15,020 --> 09:14:16,080
on that point when first

34266
09:14:16,080 --> 09:14:16,680
talked of it.

34267
09:14:18,360 --> 09:14:18,960
They were now

34268
09:14:18,960 --> 09:14:19,580
almost at the

34269
09:14:19,580 --> 09:14:20,360
door of the house,

34270
09:14:20,360 --> 09:14:21,540
for she had walked fast

34271
09:14:21,540 --> 09:14:22,540
to get rid of him

34272
09:14:22,540 --> 09:14:23,300
and unwilling

34273
09:14:23,300 --> 09:14:23,900
for her sister's

34274
09:14:23,900 --> 09:14:25,100
sake, to provoke him.

34275
09:14:25,140 --> 09:14:26,500
She only in reply

34276
09:14:26,500 --> 09:14:26,900
with a good

34277
09:14:26,900 --> 09:14:28,100
humored smile.

34278
09:14:28,340 --> 09:14:29,000
Come, Mr.

34279
09:14:29,000 --> 09:14:29,420
Wickham,

34280
09:14:29,420 --> 09:14:30,080
We are brother and.

34281
09:14:30,080 --> 09:14:31,160
Sister, you know.

34282
09:14:31,160 --> 09:14:32,220
Do not let us quarrel

34283
09:14:32,220 --> 09:14:33,420
about the past.

34284
09:14:33,480 --> 09:14:34,260
In future

34285
09:14:34,260 --> 09:14:35,580
I hope we shall always

34286
09:14:35,760 --> 09:14:36,960
of one mind.

34287
09:14:37,360 --> 09:14:38,580
She held out her hand.

34288
09:14:38,720 --> 09:14:39,320
He kissed it

34289
09:14:39,320 --> 09:14:39,960
with affectionate

34290
09:14:39,960 --> 09:14:40,720
gallantry,

34291
09:14:40,720 --> 09:14:40,980
though

34292
09:14:40,980 --> 09:14:41,640
he hardly knew

34293
09:14:41,640 --> 09:14:42,480
where to look.

34294
09:14:42,480 --> 09:14:43,320
And they entered

34295
09:14:43,320 --> 09:14:44,520
the house.

34296
09:14:46,760 --> 09:14:47,960
Chapter 53.

34297
09:14:49,000 --> 09:14:49,340
Mr.

34298
09:14:49,340 --> 09:14:49,820
Wickham was

34299
09:14:49,820 --> 09:14:51,120
so perfectly satisfied

34300
09:14:51,120 --> 09:14:52,140
with this conversation

34301
09:14:52,140 --> 09:14:53,000
that he never again

34302
09:14:53,000 --> 09:14:54,180
distressed himself

34303
09:14:54,180 --> 09:14:55,380
or provoked his dear

34304
09:14:55,540 --> 09:14:57,140
Elizabeth by introducing

34305
09:14:57,140 --> 09:14:58,340
the subject of it.

34306
09:14:58,340 --> 09:14:58,720
And she.

34307
09:14:58,720 --> 09:14:59,900
Was pleased to find that

34308
09:14:59,900 --> 09:15:00,740
she had said enough

34309
09:15:00,740 --> 09:15:01,180
to keep him.

34310
09:15:01,180 --> 09:15:02,400
Quiet.

34311
09:15:02,460 --> 09:15:03,440
The day of his

34312
09:15:03,440 --> 09:15:04,520
and Lydia's departure

34313
09:15:04,520 --> 09:15:05,940
soon came and Mrs.

34314
09:15:05,940 --> 09:15:06,800
Bennett was forced

34315
09:15:06,800 --> 09:15:07,320
to submit

34316
09:15:07,320 --> 09:15:08,520
to a separation.

34317
09:15:08,580 --> 09:15:09,140
Which, as.

34318
09:15:09,140 --> 09:15:10,440
Her husband by no means

34319
09:15:10,440 --> 09:15:10,760
entered

34320
09:15:10,760 --> 09:15:11,660
into her scheme of their

34321
09:15:11,660 --> 09:15:12,860
all going to Newcastle,

34322
09:15:13,080 --> 09:15:14,300
was likely to continue

34323
09:15:14,300 --> 09:15:15,080
at least a 12.

34324
09:15:16,180 --> 09:15:17,240
Oh, my

34325
09:15:17,240 --> 09:15:18,540
dear Lydia.

34326
09:15:18,800 --> 09:15:19,800
She cried.

34327
09:15:19,800 --> 09:15:20,360
When shall

34328
09:15:20,360 --> 09:15:21,560
we meet again?

34329
09:15:21,900 --> 09:15:23,220
Oh, Lord, I don't know.

34330
09:15:23,400 --> 09:15:24,020
Not these two

34331
09:15:24,020 --> 09:15:25,220
or three years, perhaps

34332
09:15:25,700 --> 09:15:26,500
I'll write to me

34333
09:15:26,500 --> 09:15:27,860
very often, my dear.

34334
09:15:28,400 --> 09:15:29,600
As often as I can.

34335
09:15:29,760 --> 09:15:30,260
But, you know,

34336
09:15:30,260 --> 09:15:30,820
married women

34337
09:15:30,820 --> 09:15:31,700
have never much time

34338
09:15:31,700 --> 09:15:32,500
for writing.

34339
09:15:32,500 --> 09:15:33,220
My sisters

34340
09:15:33,220 --> 09:15:34,260
may write to me.

34341
09:15:34,260 --> 09:15:34,720
They will have

34342
09:15:34,720 --> 09:15:35,940
nothing else to do.

34343
09:15:36,440 --> 09:15:36,820
Mr.

34344
09:15:36,820 --> 09:15:37,640
Wickham's views

34345
09:15:37,640 --> 09:15:38,000
were much

34346
09:15:38,000 --> 09:15:38,780
more affectionate

34347
09:15:38,780 --> 09:15:39,780
than his wife's.

34348
09:15:39,780 --> 09:15:40,680
He smiled.

34349
09:15:40,680 --> 09:15:41,540
Looked handsome,

34350
09:15:41,540 --> 09:15:42,420
and said many

34351
09:15:42,420 --> 09:15:43,620
pretty things.

34352
09:15:44,060 --> 09:15:46,260
He is as fine a fellow.

34353
09:15:46,440 --> 09:15:47,000
Said Mr.

34354
09:15:47,000 --> 09:15:47,320
Bennett,

34355
09:15:47,320 --> 09:15:48,000
as soon as they were

34356
09:15:48,000 --> 09:15:48,980
out of the house.

34357
09:15:48,980 --> 09:15:49,640
As ever,

34358
09:15:49,640 --> 09:15:51,560
I saw his sympathy

34359
09:15:51,560 --> 09:15:52,800
and smirks and makes

34360
09:15:52,800 --> 09:15:54,000
love to us all.

34361
09:15:54,120 --> 09:15:55,160
I am prodigious

34362
09:15:55,160 --> 09:15:56,360
silly, proud of him.

34363
09:15:56,360 --> 09:15:57,720
I defy even Sir

34364
09:15:57,720 --> 09:15:58,980
William Lucas himself

34365
09:15:58,980 --> 09:15:59,760
to produce a more

34366
09:15:59,760 --> 09:16:01,160
valuable son in law.

34367
09:16:02,160 --> 09:16:02,860
The loss of her

34368
09:16:02,860 --> 09:16:03,820
daughter made Mrs.

34369
09:16:03,820 --> 09:16:04,880
Bennett very dull

34370
09:16:04,880 --> 09:16:06,080
for several days.

34371
09:16:06,620 --> 09:16:07,360
I often

34372
09:16:07,360 --> 09:16:08,900
think, said she,

34373
09:16:09,260 --> 09:16:10,160
that there is nothing

34374
09:16:10,160 --> 09:16:10,580
so bad

34375
09:16:10,580 --> 09:16:11,160
as parting

34376
09:16:11,160 --> 09:16:12,360
with one's friends.

34377
09:16:12,360 --> 09:16:13,800
One seems so forlorn

34378
09:16:13,800 --> 09:16:15,000
without them,

34379
09:16:15,380 --> 09:16:16,620
this is the consequence.

34380
09:16:16,620 --> 09:16:17,460
You see, madam, of

34381
09:16:17,460 --> 09:16:18,660
marrying a daughter?

34382
09:16:18,820 --> 09:16:19,980
Said Elizabeth.

34383
09:16:19,980 --> 09:16:20,860
It must make you

34384
09:16:20,860 --> 09:16:21,920
better satisfied

34385
09:16:21,920 --> 09:16:22,860
that your other four

34386
09:16:22,860 --> 09:16:24,060
are single.

34387
09:16:24,440 --> 09:16:26,000
It is no such thing.

34388
09:16:26,320 --> 09:16:27,480
Lydia does not leave me

34389
09:16:27,480 --> 09:16:28,680
because she is married,

34390
09:16:28,820 --> 09:16:29,640
but only because

34391
09:16:29,640 --> 09:16:30,200
her husband's

34392
09:16:30,200 --> 09:16:31,000
regiment happens

34393
09:16:31,000 --> 09:16:32,220
to be so far off.

34394
09:16:32,280 --> 09:16:33,420
If that had been nearer,

34395
09:16:33,420 --> 09:16:34,260
she would not have

34396
09:16:34,260 --> 09:16:35,460
so soon.

34397
09:16:35,820 --> 09:16:36,720
But the spiritless

34398
09:16:36,720 --> 09:16:37,220
condition,

34399
09:16:37,220 --> 09:16:38,100
which this event threw

34400
09:16:38,100 --> 09:16:38,600
her into,

34401
09:16:38,600 --> 09:16:39,800
was shortly relieved,

34402
09:16:39,960 --> 09:16:40,720
and her mind

34403
09:16:40,720 --> 09:16:41,660
opened again to the.

34404
09:16:41,660 --> 09:16:42,860
Agitation of hope.

34405
09:16:42,980 --> 09:16:44,220
By an article news

34406
09:16:44,220 --> 09:16:44,960
which then began

34407
09:16:44,960 --> 09:16:46,160
to be in circulation.

34408
09:16:46,520 --> 09:16:47,360
The housekeeper

34409
09:16:47,360 --> 09:16:48,180
at another field

34410
09:16:48,180 --> 09:16:49,160
had received orders

34411
09:16:49,160 --> 09:16:49,680
to prepare

34412
09:16:49,680 --> 09:16:50,420
for the arrival

34413
09:16:50,420 --> 09:16:51,380
of her master,

34414
09:16:51,380 --> 09:16:52,320
who was coming down

34415
09:16:52,320 --> 09:16:53,520
in a day or two to shoot

34416
09:16:53,760 --> 09:16:54,960
for several weeks.

34417
09:16:55,040 --> 09:16:55,500
Mrs.

34418
09:16:55,500 --> 09:16:56,600
Bennett was quite.

34419
09:16:56,600 --> 09:16:57,600
In the. Fidgets.

34420
09:16:57,600 --> 09:16:58,280
She looked at.

34421
09:16:58,280 --> 09:16:59,640
Jane and smiled

34422
09:16:59,640 --> 09:17:00,140
and shook her

34423
09:17:00,140 --> 09:17:01,340
head by turns.

34424
09:17:01,700 --> 09:17:03,020
Well. Well.

34425
09:17:03,180 --> 09:17:03,980
And so Mr.

34426
09:17:03,980 --> 09:17:05,460
Bingley is coming down.

34427
09:17:05,460 --> 09:17:07,080
Sister for Mrs.

34428
09:17:07,080 --> 09:17:07,760
Philips first

34429
09:17:07,760 --> 09:17:08,820
brought her the news.

34430
09:17:08,820 --> 09:17:09,720
Well, so

34431
09:17:09,720 --> 09:17:10,920
much the better.

34432
09:17:11,300 --> 09:17:12,140
Not that I care

34433
09:17:12,140 --> 09:17:12,920
about it, though

34434
09:17:12,920 --> 09:17:13,940
He is nothing to us,

34435
09:17:13,940 --> 09:17:14,400
you know.

34436
09:17:14,400 --> 09:17:14,960
And I am sure

34437
09:17:14,960 --> 09:17:15,620
I never want to

34438
09:17:15,620 --> 09:17:16,820
see him again.

34439
09:17:16,920 --> 09:17:17,480
But however,

34440
09:17:17,480 --> 09:17:17,720
he is

34441
09:17:17,720 --> 09:17:18,300
very welcome

34442
09:17:18,300 --> 09:17:19,100
to come to Netherfield

34443
09:17:19,100 --> 09:17:20,160
if he likes it.

34444
09:17:20,160 --> 09:17:21,000
And who knows

34445
09:17:21,000 --> 09:17:22,200
what may happen.

34446
09:17:22,800 --> 09:17:23,240
But that is

34447
09:17:23,240 --> 09:17:24,200
nothing to us.

34448
09:17:24,200 --> 09:17:25,140
You know, Sister,

34449
09:17:25,140 --> 09:17:25,940
we agreed long ago

34450
09:17:25,940 --> 09:17:26,640
never to mention

34451
09:17:26,640 --> 09:17:27,840
a word about it.

34452
09:17:28,000 --> 09:17:28,640
And so is it

34453
09:17:28,640 --> 09:17:29,400
quite certain

34454
09:17:29,400 --> 09:17:30,600
he is coming?

34455
09:17:30,860 --> 09:17:32,600
You may depend on it.

34456
09:17:32,860 --> 09:17:34,080
Replied the other.

34457
09:17:34,100 --> 09:17:34,700
For Mrs.

34458
09:17:34,700 --> 09:17:35,680
Nicholls was in Meriden

34459
09:17:35,680 --> 09:17:36,480
last night.

34460
09:17:36,480 --> 09:17:38,040
I saw her passing by

34461
09:17:38,120 --> 09:17:39,300
and went out myself

34462
09:17:39,300 --> 09:17:39,920
on purpose

34463
09:17:39,920 --> 09:17:40,940
to know the truth of it,

34464
09:17:40,940 --> 09:17:42,000
and she told me

34465
09:17:42,000 --> 09:17:43,200
it was certainly true.

34466
09:17:43,400 --> 09:17:44,600
He comes down on

34467
09:17:44,600 --> 09:17:45,920
Thursday at the latest,

34468
09:17:45,920 --> 09:17:46,760
very likely

34469
09:17:46,760 --> 09:17:47,680
on Wednesday.

34470
09:17:47,680 --> 09:17:48,300
She was going

34471
09:17:48,300 --> 09:17:48,780
to the butcher,

34472
09:17:48,780 --> 09:17:50,000
she told me on purpose

34473
09:17:50,000 --> 09:17:50,400
to order

34474
09:17:50,400 --> 09:17:50,960
in some meat

34475
09:17:50,960 --> 09:17:51,780
on Wednesday

34476
09:17:51,780 --> 09:17:52,740
and she has got three

34477
09:17:52,740 --> 09:17:53,500
a couple of duck

34478
09:17:53,500 --> 09:17:54,780
just fit to be killed.

34479
09:17:55,080 --> 09:17:55,720
Miss Bennett

34480
09:17:55,720 --> 09:17:56,500
had not been able

34481
09:17:56,500 --> 09:17:57,380
to hear of his coming

34482
09:17:57,380 --> 09:17:58,580
without changing color.

34483
09:17:58,880 --> 09:17:59,840
It was many months

34484
09:17:59,840 --> 09:18:00,480
and she had mentioned

34485
09:18:00,480 --> 09:18:01,680
his name to Elizabeth.

34486
09:18:01,760 --> 09:18:02,320
But now,

34487
09:18:02,320 --> 09:18:02,840
as soon as they

34488
09:18:02,840 --> 09:18:03,720
were alone together,

34489
09:18:03,720 --> 09:18:04,920
she said.

34490
09:18:04,980 --> 09:18:05,960
I saw you look at me

34491
09:18:05,960 --> 09:18:06,620
today, Lizzie,

34492
09:18:06,620 --> 09:18:07,180
when my aunt

34493
09:18:07,180 --> 09:18:07,580
told us

34494
09:18:07,580 --> 09:18:08,780
of the present report,

34495
09:18:09,000 --> 09:18:09,540
and I know

34496
09:18:09,540 --> 09:18:10,740
I appeared distress,

34497
09:18:11,100 --> 09:18:12,300
but imagine it was from

34498
09:18:12,300 --> 09:18:13,500
any silly cause.

34499
09:18:13,540 --> 09:18:14,660
I was only confused

34500
09:18:14,660 --> 09:18:15,500
for the moment

34501
09:18:15,500 --> 09:18:16,160
because I felt

34502
09:18:16,160 --> 09:18:16,760
that I should be

34503
09:18:16,760 --> 09:18:17,840
looked at.

34504
09:18:17,840 --> 09:18:18,740
I do assure you

34505
09:18:18,740 --> 09:18:19,440
that the news does

34506
09:18:19,440 --> 09:18:20,040
not affect

34507
09:18:20,040 --> 09:18:20,640
me, either with

34508
09:18:20,640 --> 09:18:21,140
pleasure or.

34509
09:18:22,180 --> 09:18:23,400
I am glad of one thing

34510
09:18:23,760 --> 09:18:24,960
that he comes alone.

34511
09:18:25,040 --> 09:18:25,860
Because we shall see

34512
09:18:25,860 --> 09:18:27,040
the less of him.

34513
09:18:27,040 --> 09:18:27,720
Not that I am

34514
09:18:27,720 --> 09:18:28,920
afraid of myself,

34515
09:18:28,920 --> 09:18:29,480
but I dread

34516
09:18:29,480 --> 09:18:30,780
other people's remarks.

34517
09:18:31,700 --> 09:18:33,000
Elizabeth did not know

34518
09:18:33,000 --> 09:18:34,000
what to. Make of it.

34519
09:18:34,000 --> 09:18:35,040
Had she not seen him

34520
09:18:35,040 --> 09:18:35,960
in Derbyshire.

34521
09:18:35,960 --> 09:18:36,820
She might have supposed.

34522
09:18:36,820 --> 09:18:37,400
Him capable

34523
09:18:37,400 --> 09:18:38,000
of coming there

34524
09:18:38,000 --> 09:18:38,860
with no other view

34525
09:18:38,860 --> 09:18:39,220
than what

34526
09:18:39,220 --> 09:18:40,320
was acknowledged.

34527
09:18:40,320 --> 09:18:40,980
But she still

34528
09:18:40,980 --> 09:18:41,320
thought him.

34529
09:18:41,320 --> 09:18:42,500
Partial to Jane.

34530
09:18:42,500 --> 09:18:43,520
And she wavered as

34531
09:18:43,520 --> 09:18:44,100
to the greater

34532
09:18:44,100 --> 09:18:44,760
probability

34533
09:18:44,760 --> 09:18:45,540
of his coming there

34534
09:18:45,540 --> 09:18:46,360
with his friend's

34535
09:18:46,360 --> 09:18:47,100
permission

34536
09:18:47,100 --> 09:18:48,080
or being bold enough

34537
09:18:48,080 --> 09:18:49,280
to come without it.

34538
09:18:49,860 --> 09:18:51,360
Yet it is hard.

34539
09:18:51,560 --> 09:18:52,760
She sometimes thought

34540
09:18:52,980 --> 09:18:54,080
that this poor man

34541
09:18:54,080 --> 09:18:55,180
cannot come to a house

34542
09:18:55,180 --> 09:18:55,520
which he is

34543
09:18:55,520 --> 09:18:56,500
legally hired

34544
09:18:56,500 --> 09:18:57,300
without raising

34545
09:18:57,300 --> 09:18:58,500
all this speculation.

34546
09:18:58,880 --> 09:18:59,940
I will leave him

34547
09:18:59,940 --> 09:19:01,140
to himself.

34548
09:19:01,500 --> 09:19:02,120
In spite of.

34549
09:19:02,120 --> 09:19:03,320
What her sister declared

34550
09:19:03,380 --> 09:19:04,360
and really believed

34551
09:19:04,360 --> 09:19:05,180
to be her feelings

34552
09:19:05,180 --> 09:19:06,120
in the expectation

34553
09:19:06,120 --> 09:19:07,180
of his arrival,

34554
09:19:07,180 --> 09:19:07,920
Elizabeth could

34555
09:19:07,920 --> 09:19:08,840
easily perceive

34556
09:19:08,840 --> 09:19:09,560
that her spirits

34557
09:19:09,560 --> 09:19:10,760
were affected by.

34558
09:19:10,940 --> 09:19:11,500
They were more

34559
09:19:11,500 --> 09:19:12,920
disturbed, more unequal

34560
09:19:12,920 --> 09:19:13,680
than she had often

34561
09:19:13,680 --> 09:19:14,880
seen them.

34562
09:19:15,140 --> 09:19:15,800
The subject.

34563
09:19:15,800 --> 09:19:16,040
Which had

34564
09:19:16,040 --> 09:19:17,400
been so warmly canvased

34565
09:19:17,400 --> 09:19:18,260
between their parents

34566
09:19:18,260 --> 09:19:19,460
about a 12 month ago,

34567
09:19:19,500 --> 09:19:21,020
was now brought again.

34568
09:19:21,680 --> 09:19:22,760
As soon as ever.

34569
09:19:22,760 --> 09:19:23,060
Mr.

34570
09:19:23,060 --> 09:19:23,840
Bingley comes,

34571
09:19:23,840 --> 09:19:25,400
my dear, said Mrs.

34572
09:19:25,400 --> 09:19:25,940
Bennett.

34573
09:19:25,940 --> 09:19:26,900
You will wait on him,

34574
09:19:26,900 --> 09:19:27,960
of course.

34575
09:19:27,960 --> 09:19:28,720
No, no.

34576
09:19:28,720 --> 09:19:29,480
You forced me

34577
09:19:29,480 --> 09:19:30,680
into visiting last year

34578
09:19:30,680 --> 09:19:31,320
and promised

34579
09:19:31,320 --> 09:19:32,480
if I went to see him,

34580
09:19:32,480 --> 09:19:33,200
he should marry

34581
09:19:33,200 --> 09:19:34,400
one of my daughters.

34582
09:19:34,460 --> 09:19:35,780
But it ended in nothing.

34583
09:19:36,000 --> 09:19:37,220
And I will not be sent

34584
09:19:37,220 --> 09:19:37,920
on a fool's

34585
09:19:37,920 --> 09:19:39,120
errand again.

34586
09:19:39,620 --> 09:19:40,160
His Wife

34587
09:19:40,160 --> 09:19:41,000
represented to him

34588
09:19:41,000 --> 09:19:42,440
how absolutely necessary

34589
09:19:42,440 --> 09:19:43,160
such an attention

34590
09:19:43,160 --> 09:19:43,500
would be

34591
09:19:43,500 --> 09:19:43,860
from all

34592
09:19:43,860 --> 09:19:44,360
the neighboring

34593
09:19:44,360 --> 09:19:45,040
gentlemen.

34594
09:19:45,040 --> 09:19:45,780
On his returning

34595
09:19:45,780 --> 09:19:46,980
to Netherfield.

34596
09:19:47,040 --> 09:19:47,820
To Connecticut.

34597
09:19:47,820 --> 09:19:49,020
I despise.

34598
09:19:49,160 --> 09:19:50,220
Said he.

34599
09:19:50,220 --> 09:19:51,680
If he wants our society,

34600
09:19:51,680 --> 09:19:52,800
let him seek it.

34601
09:19:52,800 --> 09:19:54,000
He knows where we live.

34602
09:19:54,200 --> 09:19:54,660
I will not

34603
09:19:54,660 --> 09:19:55,720
spend my hours

34604
09:19:55,720 --> 09:19:56,220
in running

34605
09:19:56,220 --> 09:19:57,120
after my neighbors

34606
09:19:57,120 --> 09:19:58,280
every time they go away

34607
09:19:58,280 --> 09:19:59,480
and come back again.

34608
09:19:59,720 --> 09:20:00,920
Well, all I know

34609
09:20:00,920 --> 09:20:01,160
is that

34610
09:20:01,160 --> 09:20:01,920
it will be impossible

34611
09:20:01,920 --> 09:20:02,360
to be rude

34612
09:20:02,360 --> 09:20:02,860
if you do not

34613
09:20:02,860 --> 09:20:03,860
wait on him.

34614
09:20:03,860 --> 09:20:04,620
But, however, that

34615
09:20:04,620 --> 09:20:05,280
shan't prevent

34616
09:20:05,280 --> 09:20:05,860
my asking him

34617
09:20:05,860 --> 09:20:06,500
to dine here.

34618
09:20:06,500 --> 09:20:07,700
I am determined.

34619
09:20:07,800 --> 09:20:08,680
We must have Mrs.

34620
09:20:08,680 --> 09:20:09,740
Long and the Goldings

34621
09:20:09,740 --> 09:20:10,340
soon.

34622
09:20:10,340 --> 09:20:11,480
That will make 13

34623
09:20:11,480 --> 09:20:12,260
with ourselves.

34624
09:20:12,260 --> 09:20:12,720
So there will be

34625
09:20:12,720 --> 09:20:13,620
just room at the table

34626
09:20:13,620 --> 09:20:14,820
for him.

34627
09:20:14,960 --> 09:20:15,900
Consoled by this.

34628
09:20:15,900 --> 09:20:16,720
Resolution.

34629
09:20:16,720 --> 09:20:17,160
She was.

34630
09:20:17,160 --> 09:20:17,840
The batter, able

34631
09:20:17,840 --> 09:20:18,380
to bear her

34632
09:20:18,380 --> 09:20:19,620
husband's incivility.

34633
09:20:19,820 --> 09:20:20,000
Though

34634
09:20:20,000 --> 09:20:21,120
it was very mortifying.

34635
09:20:21,120 --> 09:20:21,360
To know

34636
09:20:21,360 --> 09:20:21,980
that her neighbors

34637
09:20:21,980 --> 09:20:22,860
might all see Mr.

34638
09:20:22,860 --> 09:20:23,420
Bingley in

34639
09:20:23,420 --> 09:20:24,380
consequence of it

34640
09:20:24,380 --> 09:20:25,580
before they did.

34641
09:20:25,640 --> 09:20:26,160
As the day.

34642
09:20:26,160 --> 09:20:26,820
Of his arrival.

34643
09:20:26,820 --> 09:20:28,020
Junior.

34644
09:20:28,140 --> 09:20:29,180
I begin to be sorry

34645
09:20:29,180 --> 09:20:30,380
that he comes at all.

34646
09:20:30,500 --> 09:20:31,760
Said Jane to her sister.

34647
09:20:32,220 --> 09:20:33,420
It would be nothing.

34648
09:20:33,440 --> 09:20:34,160
I could see him

34649
09:20:34,160 --> 09:20:34,760
with perfect

34650
09:20:34,760 --> 09:20:35,780
indifference.

34651
09:20:35,780 --> 09:20:36,860
But I can hardly bear

34652
09:20:36,860 --> 09:20:37,360
to hear it

34653
09:20:37,360 --> 09:20:38,300
thus perpetually

34654
09:20:38,300 --> 09:20:39,500
talked of.

34655
09:20:39,620 --> 09:20:40,760
My mother means well,

34656
09:20:40,760 --> 09:20:41,960
but she does not know.

34657
09:20:42,220 --> 09:20:43,460
No one can know

34658
09:20:43,700 --> 09:20:44,820
how much I suffer from

34659
09:20:44,820 --> 09:20:46,020
what she says.

34660
09:20:46,340 --> 09:20:47,460
Happy shall I be?

34661
09:20:47,460 --> 09:20:47,720
When his.

34662
09:20:47,720 --> 09:20:48,140
Stay at.

34663
09:20:48,140 --> 09:20:49,320
Netherfield? Over.

34664
09:20:50,320 --> 09:20:51,020
I wish I could

34665
09:20:51,020 --> 09:20:51,620
say anything

34666
09:20:51,620 --> 09:20:52,760
to comfort you,

34667
09:20:52,760 --> 09:20:53,960
replied Elizabeth.

34668
09:20:54,080 --> 09:20:55,040
But it is wholly

34669
09:20:55,040 --> 09:20:56,240
out of my power.

34670
09:20:56,320 --> 09:20:57,540
You must feel it.

34671
09:20:57,740 --> 09:20:58,100
And the

34672
09:20:58,100 --> 09:20:59,240
usual satisfaction

34673
09:20:59,240 --> 09:21:00,320
of preaching patience

34674
09:21:00,320 --> 09:21:01,040
to a sufferer

34675
09:21:01,040 --> 09:21:02,180
is denied me.

34676
09:21:02,180 --> 09:21:03,360
Because you have always

34677
09:21:03,360 --> 09:21:04,560
so much.

34678
09:21:04,820 --> 09:21:05,220
Mr.

34679
09:21:05,220 --> 09:21:06,420
Bingley arrived.

34680
09:21:06,420 --> 09:21:06,800
Mrs.

34681
09:21:06,800 --> 09:21:07,180
Bennet,

34682
09:21:07,180 --> 09:21:08,040
through the assistance

34683
09:21:08,040 --> 09:21:09,260
of servants, to

34684
09:21:09,260 --> 09:21:09,920
have the earliest

34685
09:21:09,920 --> 09:21:10,920
tidings of it,

34686
09:21:10,920 --> 09:21:11,640
that the period

34687
09:21:11,640 --> 09:21:12,380
of anxiety

34688
09:21:12,380 --> 09:21:13,100
and fruitfulness

34689
09:21:13,100 --> 09:21:13,800
on her side

34690
09:21:13,800 --> 09:21:14,160
might be

34691
09:21:14,160 --> 09:21:15,360
as long as it could.

34692
09:21:15,600 --> 09:21:16,580
She counted the days

34693
09:21:16,580 --> 09:21:17,460
that must intervene

34694
09:21:17,460 --> 09:21:18,380
before their invitation

34695
09:21:18,380 --> 09:21:19,280
could be sent.

34696
09:21:19,280 --> 09:21:19,820
Hopeless

34697
09:21:19,820 --> 09:21:21,020
of seeing him before.

34698
09:21:21,320 --> 09:21:22,000
But on the third

34699
09:21:22,000 --> 09:21:22,360
morning,

34700
09:21:22,360 --> 09:21:23,160
after his arrival

34701
09:21:23,160 --> 09:21:24,180
in Hertfordshire,

34702
09:21:24,180 --> 09:21:25,280
she saw him from her

34703
09:21:25,280 --> 09:21:25,760
dressing room

34704
09:21:25,760 --> 09:21:26,760
window, enter

34705
09:21:26,760 --> 09:21:27,860
the paddock and ride

34706
09:21:27,860 --> 09:21:29,060
towards house.

34707
09:21:29,280 --> 09:21:30,000
Her daughters

34708
09:21:30,000 --> 09:21:30,820
were eagerly called

34709
09:21:30,820 --> 09:21:32,040
to partake of her joy.

34710
09:21:32,300 --> 09:21:33,320
Jane resolutely

34711
09:21:33,320 --> 09:21:33,980
kept her place

34712
09:21:33,980 --> 09:21:34,860
at the table.

34713
09:21:34,860 --> 09:21:35,660
But Elizabeth.

34714
09:21:35,660 --> 09:21:36,860
To satisfy her mother,

34715
09:21:36,860 --> 09:21:38,060
went to the window.

34716
09:21:38,120 --> 09:21:39,000
She looked.

34717
09:21:39,000 --> 09:21:39,800
She saw Mr.

34718
09:21:39,800 --> 09:21:40,820
Darcy with. Him.

34719
09:21:40,820 --> 09:21:42,020
And sat down again

34720
09:21:42,020 --> 09:21:43,220
by her sister.

34721
09:21:43,540 --> 09:21:44,320
There is a gentleman

34722
09:21:44,320 --> 09:21:45,320
with your mama,

34723
09:21:45,320 --> 09:21:46,180
said Kitty.

34724
09:21:46,180 --> 09:21:47,400
Who can it be?

34725
09:21:47,660 --> 09:21:48,560
Some acquaintance,

34726
09:21:48,560 --> 09:21:48,800
rather.

34727
09:21:48,800 --> 09:21:49,320
My dear,

34728
09:21:49,320 --> 09:21:49,980
I suppose

34729
09:21:49,980 --> 09:21:51,300
I am sure I do not know,

34730
09:21:52,080 --> 09:21:53,680
Lah replied Kitty.

34731
09:21:54,020 --> 09:21:54,920
It looks just like

34732
09:21:54,920 --> 09:21:55,340
that man

34733
09:21:55,340 --> 09:21:55,820
that used to be

34734
09:21:55,820 --> 09:21:56,960
with him before. Mr.

34735
09:21:56,960 --> 09:21:57,200
What's.

34736
09:21:57,200 --> 09:21:57,680
His name

34737
09:21:57,680 --> 09:21:59,160
that tall, proud man.

34738
09:21:59,900 --> 09:22:01,720
Good gracious, Mr.

34739
09:22:01,720 --> 09:22:02,780
Darcy.

34740
09:22:02,780 --> 09:22:04,440
And so it does, I vow.

34741
09:22:05,000 --> 09:22:06,560
Well, any friend of Mr.

34742
09:22:06,560 --> 09:22:06,740
Bing,

34743
09:22:06,740 --> 09:22:07,580
this will always be

34744
09:22:07,580 --> 09:22:08,780
welcome here to be sure.

34745
09:22:09,000 --> 09:22:09,920
But I must say that

34746
09:22:09,920 --> 09:22:10,620
I hate the very

34747
09:22:10,620 --> 09:22:11,820
sight of him.

34748
09:22:12,040 --> 09:22:12,660
Jane looked.

34749
09:22:12,660 --> 09:22:13,160
At Elizabeth

34750
09:22:13,160 --> 09:22:13,940
with surprise and.

34751
09:22:13,940 --> 09:22:14,900
Concern.

34752
09:22:14,900 --> 09:22:15,360
She knew

34753
09:22:15,360 --> 09:22:16,100
but little of their

34754
09:22:16,100 --> 09:22:17,300
meeting in Derbyshire

34755
09:22:17,320 --> 09:22:18,320
and therefore felt

34756
09:22:18,320 --> 09:22:19,160
for the awkwardness

34757
09:22:19,160 --> 09:22:19,520
which must

34758
09:22:19,520 --> 09:22:20,580
attend her sister

34759
09:22:20,580 --> 09:22:21,220
in seeing him

34760
09:22:21,220 --> 09:22:21,820
almost for

34761
09:22:21,820 --> 09:22:22,680
the first time

34762
09:22:22,680 --> 09:22:23,320
after receiving

34763
09:22:23,320 --> 09:22:24,540
his explanatory letter.

34764
09:22:25,000 --> 09:22:25,800
Both sisters

34765
09:22:25,800 --> 09:22:26,500
were uncomfortable

34766
09:22:26,500 --> 09:22:27,260
enough.

34767
09:22:27,260 --> 09:22:28,640
Each felt for the other

34768
09:22:28,820 --> 09:22:29,500
and of course,

34769
09:22:29,500 --> 09:22:30,560
for themselves.

34770
09:22:30,560 --> 09:22:31,580
And their mother talked

34771
09:22:31,580 --> 09:22:33,000
on of her dislike of Mr.

34772
09:22:33,000 --> 09:22:34,540
Darcy and her resolution

34773
09:22:34,540 --> 09:22:35,420
to be civil to him

34774
09:22:35,420 --> 09:22:36,260
only as Mr.

34775
09:22:36,260 --> 09:22:37,280
Bingley friend.

34776
09:22:37,280 --> 09:22:37,700
Without.

34777
09:22:37,700 --> 09:22:38,320
Being heard

34778
09:22:38,320 --> 09:22:39,540
by either of them.

34779
09:22:39,960 --> 09:22:40,640
But Elizabeth.

34780
09:22:40,640 --> 09:22:41,280
Had sources

34781
09:22:41,280 --> 09:22:41,960
of uneasiness

34782
09:22:41,960 --> 09:22:42,480
which could not

34783
09:22:42,480 --> 09:22:43,400
be suspected by.

34784
09:22:43,400 --> 09:22:44,120
Jane.

34785
09:22:44,120 --> 09:22:44,780
To whom she had

34786
09:22:44,780 --> 09:22:45,320
never yet

34787
09:22:45,320 --> 09:22:46,540
had courage to show Mrs.

34788
09:22:46,540 --> 09:22:47,660
Gardner's

34789
09:22:47,660 --> 09:22:48,380
or to relate

34790
09:22:48,380 --> 09:22:49,080
her own change

34791
09:22:49,080 --> 09:22:49,640
of sentiment

34792
09:22:49,640 --> 09:22:50,720
towards him.

34793
09:22:50,720 --> 09:22:51,320
To Jane,

34794
09:22:51,320 --> 09:22:52,400
he could only be a man

34795
09:22:52,400 --> 09:22:53,140
whose proposal.

34796
09:22:53,140 --> 09:22:54,380
She had refused and.

34797
09:22:54,380 --> 09:22:54,920
Whose merit

34798
09:22:54,920 --> 09:22:56,120
she had undervalued.

34799
09:22:56,240 --> 09:22:57,200
But to her more

34800
09:22:57,200 --> 09:22:58,400
extensive information.

34801
09:22:58,680 --> 09:22:59,600
He was the person

34802
09:22:59,600 --> 09:22:59,940
to whom

34803
09:22:59,940 --> 09:23:00,740
the whole family

34804
09:23:00,740 --> 09:23:01,400
were indebted

34805
09:23:01,400 --> 09:23:01,640
for the

34806
09:23:01,640 --> 09:23:02,840
first of benefits.

34807
09:23:02,940 --> 09:23:03,380
And whom.

34808
09:23:03,380 --> 09:23:04,440
She regarded herself

34809
09:23:04,440 --> 09:23:05,320
with an interest,

34810
09:23:05,320 --> 09:23:06,740
if not quite so tender,

34811
09:23:06,980 --> 09:23:08,320
at least as reasonable,

34812
09:23:08,320 --> 09:23:09,480
and just as what

34813
09:23:09,480 --> 09:23:10,760
Jane felt for Bingley.

34814
09:23:11,240 --> 09:23:12,080
Her astonishment.

34815
09:23:12,080 --> 09:23:13,440
At his coming at his.

34816
09:23:13,440 --> 09:23:13,720
Coming

34817
09:23:13,720 --> 09:23:14,500
to Netherfield

34818
09:23:14,500 --> 09:23:15,000
too long,

34819
09:23:15,000 --> 09:23:16,220
born and voluntarily

34820
09:23:16,220 --> 09:23:17,320
seeking her again.

34821
09:23:17,320 --> 09:23:18,420
Was almost equal.

34822
09:23:18,420 --> 09:23:19,260
To what she had known.

34823
09:23:19,260 --> 09:23:20,120
On first witnessing

34824
09:23:20,120 --> 09:23:20,660
his altered

34825
09:23:20,660 --> 09:23:21,920
behavior in Derbyshire,

34826
09:23:22,940 --> 09:23:23,420
the color

34827
09:23:23,420 --> 09:23:23,820
which had been

34828
09:23:23,820 --> 09:23:24,720
driven from her face,

34829
09:23:24,720 --> 09:23:25,260
returned for

34830
09:23:25,260 --> 09:23:25,760
half a minute

34831
09:23:25,760 --> 09:23:26,960
with an additional

34832
09:23:27,040 --> 09:23:28,280
and a smile of delight,

34833
09:23:28,280 --> 09:23:29,600
added luster to her eyes

34834
09:23:29,840 --> 09:23:30,820
as she thought for that

34835
09:23:30,820 --> 09:23:31,680
space of time

34836
09:23:31,680 --> 09:23:32,580
that his affection

34837
09:23:32,580 --> 09:23:33,180
and wishes

34838
09:23:33,180 --> 09:23:34,580
must still be unshaken.

34839
09:23:34,980 --> 09:23:35,460
But she would

34840
09:23:35,460 --> 09:23:36,660
not be secure.

34841
09:23:37,440 --> 09:23:38,240
Let me first

34842
09:23:38,240 --> 09:23:39,560
see how he behaves,

34843
09:23:39,780 --> 09:23:40,760
said she.

34844
09:23:40,760 --> 09:23:41,360
It will then

34845
09:23:41,360 --> 09:23:41,840
be early

34846
09:23:41,840 --> 09:23:43,360
enough for expectation.

34847
09:23:44,300 --> 09:23:45,420
She sat intently

34848
09:23:45,420 --> 09:23:45,920
at work,

34849
09:23:45,920 --> 09:23:47,280
striving to be composed

34850
09:23:47,360 --> 09:23:48,500
without daring to lift

34851
09:23:48,500 --> 09:23:49,340
up her eyes.

34852
09:23:49,340 --> 09:23:49,980
Till anxious.

34853
09:23:49,980 --> 09:23:51,200
Curiosity carried them

34854
09:23:51,200 --> 09:23:51,660
to the face

34855
09:23:51,660 --> 09:23:52,320
of her sister

34856
09:23:52,320 --> 09:23:52,980
as the servant

34857
09:23:52,980 --> 09:23:53,540
was approaching

34858
09:23:53,540 --> 09:23:54,440
the door.

34859
09:23:54,440 --> 09:23:55,140
Jane looked a.

34860
09:23:55,140 --> 09:23:56,380
Little paler than usual,

34861
09:23:56,500 --> 09:23:57,480
but more sedate

34862
09:23:57,480 --> 09:23:58,040
than Elizabeth

34863
09:23:58,040 --> 09:23:59,240
had expected.

34864
09:23:59,300 --> 09:24:00,040
On the gentleman's.

34865
09:24:00,040 --> 09:24:00,600
Appearing,

34866
09:24:00,600 --> 09:24:01,800
her color increased.

34867
09:24:01,860 --> 09:24:02,720
Yet she received.

34868
09:24:02,720 --> 09:24:03,980
Them with tolerable ease

34869
09:24:04,180 --> 09:24:04,540
and with the

34870
09:24:04,540 --> 09:24:05,820
propriety of behavior

34871
09:24:05,820 --> 09:24:06,500
equally

34872
09:24:06,500 --> 09:24:07,320
from any symptom

34873
09:24:07,320 --> 09:24:07,980
of resentment

34874
09:24:07,980 --> 09:24:09,020
or any unnecessary

34875
09:24:09,020 --> 09:24:10,220
complacence.

34876
09:24:10,520 --> 09:24:11,320
Elizabeth said

34877
09:24:11,320 --> 09:24:12,200
as little to either

34878
09:24:12,200 --> 09:24:13,400
as civility would allow,

34879
09:24:13,620 --> 09:24:14,500
and sat down again

34880
09:24:14,500 --> 09:24:15,300
to her work

34881
09:24:15,300 --> 09:24:16,140
with an eagerness

34882
09:24:16,140 --> 09:24:16,860
which it did not

34883
09:24:16,860 --> 09:24:18,060
often command.

34884
09:24:18,120 --> 09:24:18,780
She had ventured.

34885
09:24:18,780 --> 09:24:19,260
Only one

34886
09:24:19,260 --> 09:24:20,460
glance at Darcy.

34887
09:24:20,760 --> 09:24:21,140
He looked

34888
09:24:21,140 --> 09:24:22,340
serious as usual.

34889
09:24:22,540 --> 09:24:23,240
And she thought.

34890
09:24:23,240 --> 09:24:23,860
More as he had

34891
09:24:23,860 --> 09:24:24,220
been used

34892
09:24:24,220 --> 09:24:25,440
to look in Hertfordshire

34893
09:24:25,500 --> 09:24:26,120
than as she had

34894
09:24:26,120 --> 09:24:27,320
seen him at Pemberley.

34895
09:24:27,600 --> 09:24:28,260
But perhaps

34896
09:24:28,260 --> 09:24:28,820
he could not,

34897
09:24:28,820 --> 09:24:29,460
in her mother's

34898
09:24:29,460 --> 09:24:30,820
presence, be what he was

34899
09:24:30,820 --> 09:24:31,260
before her

34900
09:24:31,260 --> 09:24:32,460
aunt and uncle.

34901
09:24:32,460 --> 09:24:33,560
It was a painful

34902
09:24:33,560 --> 09:24:34,280
but not an

34903
09:24:34,280 --> 09:24:35,720
improbable conjecture.

34904
09:24:36,920 --> 09:24:38,220
Bingley she had likewise

34905
09:24:38,220 --> 09:24:39,420
seen for an instant,

34906
09:24:39,420 --> 09:24:40,720
and in that short period

34907
09:24:40,720 --> 09:24:41,360
saw him looking

34908
09:24:41,360 --> 09:24:42,140
both pleased

34909
09:24:42,140 --> 09:24:43,340
and embarrassed.

34910
09:24:43,440 --> 09:24:44,680
He was received by Mrs.

34911
09:24:44,680 --> 09:24:44,960
Bennet

34912
09:24:44,960 --> 09:24:45,480
with a degree

34913
09:24:45,480 --> 09:24:46,100
of civility,

34914
09:24:46,100 --> 09:24:46,640
which made her

34915
09:24:46,640 --> 09:24:47,840
two daughters ashamed,

34916
09:24:48,140 --> 09:24:48,780
especially

34917
09:24:48,780 --> 09:24:49,540
when contrasted

34918
09:24:49,540 --> 09:24:50,220
with the cold

34919
09:24:50,220 --> 09:24:51,040
and ceremonious

34920
09:24:51,040 --> 09:24:51,560
politeness

34921
09:24:51,560 --> 09:24:52,400
of her curtsey

34922
09:24:52,400 --> 09:24:53,040
and addressed

34923
09:24:53,040 --> 09:24:54,240
to his friend

34924
09:24:54,380 --> 09:24:54,920
Elizabeth,

34925
09:24:54,920 --> 09:24:55,920
particularly knew

34926
09:24:55,920 --> 09:24:56,420
that her mother

34927
09:24:56,420 --> 09:24:57,300
owed to the latter.

34928
09:24:57,300 --> 09:24:58,000
The preservation

34929
09:24:58,000 --> 09:24:59,040
of her favorite daughter

34930
09:24:59,040 --> 09:25:00,440
from irremediable infamy

34931
09:25:00,680 --> 09:25:02,160
was hurt and distressed

34932
09:25:02,160 --> 09:25:03,440
to a most painful degree

34933
09:25:03,440 --> 09:25:04,280
by a distinction

34934
09:25:04,280 --> 09:25:05,480
so ill applied.

34935
09:25:06,380 --> 09:25:06,960
Darcy,

34936
09:25:06,960 --> 09:25:08,120
after inquiring of her,

34937
09:25:08,120 --> 09:25:09,000
how Mr. and Mrs.

34938
09:25:09,000 --> 09:25:09,960
Gardner did.

34939
09:25:09,960 --> 09:25:10,880
A question which she.

34940
09:25:10,880 --> 09:25:11,600
Could not answer

34941
09:25:11,600 --> 09:25:12,800
without confusion,

34942
09:25:12,800 --> 09:25:14,220
said scarcely anything.

34943
09:25:14,480 --> 09:25:15,420
He was not seated

34944
09:25:15,420 --> 09:25:16,000
by her.

34945
09:25:16,000 --> 09:25:16,880
Perhaps that was the

34946
09:25:16,880 --> 09:25:18,080
reason of his silence.

34947
09:25:18,220 --> 09:25:18,900
But it had not.

34948
09:25:18,900 --> 09:25:20,120
Been so in Derbyshire.

34949
09:25:20,540 --> 09:25:20,860
There

34950
09:25:20,860 --> 09:25:21,360
he had talked

34951
09:25:21,360 --> 09:25:22,000
to her friends

34952
09:25:22,000 --> 09:25:22,340
when he could,

34953
09:25:22,340 --> 09:25:23,540
not to herself.

34954
09:25:23,680 --> 09:25:24,200
But now.

34955
09:25:24,200 --> 09:25:25,400
Several minutes elapsed,

34956
09:25:25,640 --> 09:25:26,000
bringing the

34957
09:25:26,000 --> 09:25:26,500
sound of his.

34958
09:25:26,500 --> 09:25:27,300
Voice.

34959
09:25:27,300 --> 09:25:27,780
And when.

34960
09:25:27,780 --> 09:25:29,120
Occasionally unable

34961
09:25:29,120 --> 09:25:29,600
to resist

34962
09:25:29,600 --> 09:25:30,260
the impulse of.

34963
09:25:30,260 --> 09:25:31,720
Curiosity, she raised.

34964
09:25:31,720 --> 09:25:32,160
Her eyes.

34965
09:25:32,160 --> 09:25:33,140
To his face.

34966
09:25:33,140 --> 09:25:34,360
She, as often found him

34967
09:25:34,360 --> 09:25:35,280
looking at Jane

34968
09:25:35,280 --> 09:25:36,200
as at herself.

34969
09:25:36,200 --> 09:25:36,440
And.

34970
09:25:36,440 --> 09:25:37,800
Frequently on no object

34971
09:25:37,800 --> 09:25:39,000
but to the ground.

34972
09:25:39,200 --> 09:25:40,220
More thoughtfulness

34973
09:25:40,220 --> 09:25:41,240
and less anxiety

34974
09:25:41,240 --> 09:25:41,820
to pleas

34975
09:25:41,820 --> 09:25:42,360
than when they had

34976
09:25:42,360 --> 09:25:43,280
last met were

34977
09:25:43,280 --> 09:25:44,480
plainly expressed.

34978
09:25:44,760 --> 09:25:45,080
She was

34979
09:25:46,040 --> 09:25:46,820
and angry with

34980
09:25:46,820 --> 09:25:48,120
herself for being so.

34981
09:25:49,220 --> 09:25:50,180
Could I expect it

34982
09:25:50,180 --> 09:25:51,320
to be otherwise?

34983
09:25:51,320 --> 09:25:52,520
Said she. Yet.

34984
09:25:52,540 --> 09:25:53,760
Why did he come?

34985
09:25:54,360 --> 09:25:54,960
She was in no.

34986
09:25:54,960 --> 09:25:56,100
Humor for conversation

34987
09:25:56,100 --> 09:25:57,300
with anyone but himself.

34988
09:25:57,420 --> 09:25:58,100
And to him

34989
09:25:58,100 --> 09:25:59,180
she had hardly courage

34990
09:25:59,180 --> 09:26:00,380
to speak.

34991
09:26:00,540 --> 09:26:01,180
She inquired

34992
09:26:01,180 --> 09:26:02,420
after his sister, but

34993
09:26:02,420 --> 09:26:03,620
could do no more.

34994
09:26:04,000 --> 09:26:05,300
It is a long time, Mr.

34995
09:26:05,300 --> 09:26:05,640
Bingley,

34996
09:26:05,640 --> 09:26:06,840
since you went away,

34997
09:26:06,920 --> 09:26:07,460
said Mrs.

34998
09:26:07,460 --> 09:26:08,300
Bennet.

34999
09:26:08,300 --> 09:26:09,540
He readily agreed to it.

35000
09:26:10,000 --> 09:26:11,160
I began to be afraid

35001
09:26:11,160 --> 09:26:11,360
you would

35002
09:26:11,360 --> 09:26:12,560
never come back again.

35003
09:26:12,720 --> 09:26:13,400
People did

35004
09:26:13,400 --> 09:26:13,980
say you meant

35005
09:26:13,980 --> 09:26:14,660
to quit the place

35006
09:26:14,660 --> 09:26:15,860
entirely, Nicholas.

35007
09:26:15,980 --> 09:26:16,640
But, however,

35008
09:26:16,640 --> 09:26:17,840
I hope it is not true.

35009
09:26:18,180 --> 09:26:19,340
A great many changes.

35010
09:26:19,340 --> 09:26:19,760
Have happened

35011
09:26:19,760 --> 09:26:20,300
in the neighborhood.

35012
09:26:20,300 --> 09:26:21,300
Since you went away.

35013
09:26:21,300 --> 09:26:21,980
Miss Luke is.

35014
09:26:21,980 --> 09:26:23,180
Is married and settled.

35015
09:26:23,320 --> 09:26:23,820
And one of

35016
09:26:23,820 --> 09:26:24,860
my own daughters.

35017
09:26:24,860 --> 09:26:25,360
I suppose

35018
09:26:25,360 --> 09:26:26,280
you've heard of it.

35019
09:26:26,280 --> 09:26:26,760
Indeed.

35020
09:26:26,760 --> 09:26:27,420
You must have seen it

35021
09:26:27,420 --> 09:26:28,260
in the papers.

35022
09:26:28,260 --> 09:26:29,180
It was in The Times

35023
09:26:29,180 --> 09:26:29,780
and the Courier.

35024
09:26:29,780 --> 09:26:31,140
I know, but it was not

35025
09:26:31,140 --> 09:26:31,500
put in

35026
09:26:31,500 --> 09:26:32,460
as it ought to be.

35027
09:26:32,460 --> 09:26:33,660
It was only said

35028
09:26:33,920 --> 09:26:34,940
George became a squire

35029
09:26:34,940 --> 09:26:35,960
to miss Lydia Bennet

35030
09:26:35,960 --> 09:26:36,480
without there

35031
09:26:36,480 --> 09:26:37,180
being a syllable

35032
09:26:37,180 --> 09:26:38,120
said of her father

35033
09:26:38,120 --> 09:26:38,720
or the place

35034
09:26:38,720 --> 09:26:39,300
where she lived

35035
09:26:39,300 --> 09:26:40,140
or anything.

35036
09:26:40,140 --> 09:26:40,880
It was my brother.

35037
09:26:40,880 --> 09:26:41,360
Gardener's

35038
09:26:41,360 --> 09:26:42,260
drawing up too,

35039
09:26:42,260 --> 09:26:43,360
and I wonder how he came

35040
09:26:43,360 --> 09:26:43,820
to make such

35041
09:26:43,820 --> 09:26:44,360
an awkward

35042
09:26:44,360 --> 09:26:45,560
business of it.

35043
09:26:45,560 --> 09:26:46,760
Did you see it?

35044
09:26:47,100 --> 09:26:47,900
Bingley replied

35045
09:26:47,900 --> 09:26:49,140
that he did and made

35046
09:26:49,140 --> 09:26:50,340
his congratulations.

35047
09:26:50,580 --> 09:26:51,480
Elizabeth dared

35048
09:26:51,480 --> 09:26:52,760
not lift up her eyes

35049
09:26:53,120 --> 09:26:53,640
how Mr.

35050
09:26:53,640 --> 09:26:54,780
Darcy looked, therefore,

35051
09:26:54,780 --> 09:26:55,980
she could not tell.

35052
09:26:56,420 --> 09:26:57,780
It is a delightful thing

35053
09:26:57,780 --> 09:26:58,340
to be sure

35054
09:26:58,340 --> 09:26:58,980
to have a daughter

35055
09:26:58,980 --> 09:26:59,860
well married.

35056
09:26:59,860 --> 09:27:01,080
Continued her mother.

35057
09:27:01,080 --> 09:27:02,060
But at the same

35058
09:27:02,060 --> 09:27:03,260
time, Mr.

35059
09:27:03,300 --> 09:27:04,440
it is very hard

35060
09:27:04,440 --> 09:27:05,220
to have had taken

35061
09:27:05,220 --> 09:27:06,420
such a way from me.

35062
09:27:06,440 --> 09:27:07,000
They are gone

35063
09:27:07,000 --> 09:27:08,220
down to Newcastle,

35064
09:27:08,220 --> 09:27:09,380
a place quite northward,

35065
09:27:09,380 --> 09:27:10,000
it seems,

35066
09:27:10,000 --> 09:27:10,500
and there

35067
09:27:10,500 --> 09:27:11,060
they are to stay.

35068
09:27:11,060 --> 09:27:12,260
I do not know how long

35069
09:27:12,680 --> 09:27:13,320
as regiment

35070
09:27:13,320 --> 09:27:13,960
is there for.

35071
09:27:13,960 --> 09:27:14,400
I suppose

35072
09:27:14,400 --> 09:27:14,940
you've heard of his

35073
09:27:14,940 --> 09:27:15,920
leaving the blank

35074
09:27:15,920 --> 09:27:16,860
and of his being gone

35075
09:27:16,860 --> 09:27:18,020
into the regulars.

35076
09:27:18,020 --> 09:27:18,740
Thank heaven

35077
09:27:18,740 --> 09:27:19,940
he has some friends,

35078
09:27:20,000 --> 09:27:20,220
though

35079
09:27:20,220 --> 09:27:21,320
perhaps not so many

35080
09:27:21,320 --> 09:27:22,520
as he deserves.

35081
09:27:23,060 --> 09:27:23,760
Elizabeth,

35082
09:27:23,760 --> 09:27:24,380
who knew this

35083
09:27:24,380 --> 09:27:25,340
to be leveled at Mr.

35084
09:27:25,340 --> 09:27:26,760
Darcy was in such

35085
09:27:26,760 --> 09:27:27,780
a misery of shame

35086
09:27:27,780 --> 09:27:28,140
that she could

35087
09:27:28,140 --> 09:27:29,340
hardly keep her seat.

35088
09:27:29,500 --> 09:27:30,200
It drew from her,

35089
09:27:30,200 --> 09:27:30,500
however,

35090
09:27:30,500 --> 09:27:31,720
the exertion of speaking

35091
09:27:31,860 --> 09:27:33,180
which else had so have

35092
09:27:33,180 --> 09:27:34,380
actually done before.

35093
09:27:34,540 --> 09:27:35,500
And she asked Bingley

35094
09:27:35,500 --> 09:27:36,000
whether he meant

35095
09:27:36,000 --> 09:27:36,740
to make any stay

35096
09:27:36,740 --> 09:27:37,280
in the country

35097
09:27:37,280 --> 09:27:38,300
at present.

35098
09:27:38,300 --> 09:27:39,120
A few weeks,

35099
09:27:39,120 --> 09:27:40,320
he believed.

35100
09:27:40,400 --> 09:27:41,400
When you have killed

35101
09:27:41,400 --> 09:27:42,540
all your own birds, Mr.

35102
09:27:42,540 --> 09:27:43,160
Bingley.

35103
09:27:43,160 --> 09:27:44,060
Said her mother.

35104
09:27:44,060 --> 09:27:44,640
I beg you,

35105
09:27:44,640 --> 09:27:45,560
will come here and shoot

35106
09:27:45,560 --> 09:27:46,000
as many

35107
09:27:46,000 --> 09:27:46,820
as you please on Mr.

35108
09:27:46,820 --> 09:27:47,820
Bennett's manner.

35109
09:27:47,820 --> 09:27:48,300
I am sure

35110
09:27:48,300 --> 09:27:48,980
he will be vastly

35111
09:27:48,980 --> 09:27:49,760
happy to oblige

35112
09:27:49,760 --> 09:27:50,760
you and will save

35113
09:27:50,760 --> 09:27:51,980
all the best the Colbys

35114
09:27:51,980 --> 09:27:53,180
for you.

35115
09:27:53,280 --> 09:27:54,200
Elizabeth's misery

35116
09:27:54,200 --> 09:27:54,720
increased

35117
09:27:54,720 --> 09:27:55,040
at such

35118
09:27:55,040 --> 09:27:56,180
unnecessary, such

35119
09:27:56,180 --> 09:27:57,380
officious attention

35120
09:27:57,740 --> 09:27:58,340
were the same

35121
09:27:58,340 --> 09:27:59,220
fare prospect

35122
09:27:59,220 --> 09:28:00,600
to arise at present, as

35123
09:28:00,600 --> 09:28:01,160
had flattered

35124
09:28:01,160 --> 09:28:02,160
them a year ago.

35125
09:28:02,160 --> 09:28:02,820
Everything

35126
09:28:02,820 --> 09:28:03,720
she was persuaded

35127
09:28:03,720 --> 09:28:04,400
would be hastening

35128
09:28:04,400 --> 09:28:04,880
to the same

35129
09:28:04,880 --> 09:28:06,220
vexatious conclusion.

35130
09:28:06,740 --> 09:28:07,860
At that instant.

35131
09:28:07,860 --> 09:28:08,320
She felt

35132
09:28:08,320 --> 09:28:09,540
that years of happiness

35133
09:28:09,540 --> 09:28:10,460
could not make Jane

35134
09:28:10,460 --> 09:28:10,980
or herself

35135
09:28:10,980 --> 09:28:12,000
amends for moments

35136
09:28:12,000 --> 09:28:12,860
of such painful.

35137
09:28:12,860 --> 09:28:14,060
Confusion.

35138
09:28:14,280 --> 09:28:14,940
The first

35139
09:28:14,940 --> 09:28:16,140
wish of my heart.

35140
09:28:16,400 --> 09:28:17,600
Said she, to herself.

35141
09:28:17,820 --> 09:28:18,600
Is never more

35142
09:28:18,600 --> 09:28:19,320
to be in company

35143
09:28:19,320 --> 09:28:20,500
with either of them.

35144
09:28:20,500 --> 09:28:21,960
Their society afford no

35145
09:28:21,960 --> 09:28:22,820
pleasure that will atone

35146
09:28:22,820 --> 09:28:23,720
for such wretchedness

35147
09:28:23,720 --> 09:28:24,660
as this.

35148
09:28:24,660 --> 09:28:25,520
Let me never see

35149
09:28:25,520 --> 09:28:26,180
either one

35150
09:28:26,180 --> 09:28:27,380
or the other again.

35151
09:28:28,160 --> 09:28:29,180
Yet the misery

35152
09:28:29,180 --> 09:28:29,900
for which years

35153
09:28:29,900 --> 09:28:30,480
of happiness

35154
09:28:30,480 --> 09:28:31,100
were to offer no

35155
09:28:32,180 --> 09:28:32,900
received soon

35156
09:28:32,900 --> 09:28:33,420
afterwards

35157
09:28:33,420 --> 09:28:34,580
material relief

35158
09:28:34,580 --> 09:28:35,280
from observing

35159
09:28:35,280 --> 09:28:36,180
how much the beauty

35160
09:28:36,180 --> 09:28:37,360
of her sister rekindled

35161
09:28:37,360 --> 09:28:38,120
the admiration

35162
09:28:38,120 --> 09:28:39,320
of her former lover.

35163
09:28:39,420 --> 09:28:40,360
When first he came,

35164
09:28:40,360 --> 09:28:40,800
then he had

35165
09:28:40,800 --> 09:28:41,400
spoken to her,

35166
09:28:41,400 --> 09:28:42,180
but little

35167
09:28:42,180 --> 09:28:43,360
but every 5 minutes

35168
09:28:43,360 --> 09:28:44,220
seemed to be giving her

35169
09:28:44,220 --> 09:28:45,420
more of his attention.

35170
09:28:45,620 --> 09:28:46,920
He found her as handsome

35171
09:28:46,920 --> 09:28:47,240
as she had

35172
09:28:47,240 --> 09:28:48,260
been last year,

35173
09:28:48,260 --> 09:28:49,220
as good natured

35174
09:28:49,220 --> 09:28:50,420
and as unaffected.

35175
09:28:50,480 --> 09:28:51,980
Though not so chatty.

35176
09:28:52,400 --> 09:28:53,320
Jane was anxious

35177
09:28:53,320 --> 09:28:54,000
that no difference

35178
09:28:54,000 --> 09:28:54,620
should be perceived

35179
09:28:54,620 --> 09:28:55,400
in her at all

35180
09:28:55,400 --> 09:28:56,500
and was really persuaded

35181
09:28:56,500 --> 09:28:57,080
that she talked

35182
09:28:57,080 --> 09:28:58,100
as much as ever.

35183
09:28:58,100 --> 09:28:59,040
But her mind was so

35184
09:28:59,040 --> 09:28:59,840
busily engaged

35185
09:28:59,840 --> 09:29:00,180
that she did

35186
09:29:00,180 --> 09:29:00,960
not always know

35187
09:29:00,960 --> 09:29:02,160
when she was silent.

35188
09:29:02,760 --> 09:29:03,380
When the gentleman

35189
09:29:03,380 --> 09:29:04,260
rose to go away.

35190
09:29:04,260 --> 09:29:04,540
Mrs.

35191
09:29:04,540 --> 09:29:05,400
Bennett was mindful

35192
09:29:05,400 --> 09:29:05,640
of her

35193
09:29:05,640 --> 09:29:06,780
intended civility,

35194
09:29:06,780 --> 09:29:07,700
and they were invited

35195
09:29:07,700 --> 09:29:08,280
and engaged

35196
09:29:08,280 --> 09:29:09,320
to dine at Long Bourne

35197
09:29:09,320 --> 09:29:10,520
in a few days time.

35198
09:29:11,000 --> 09:29:12,220
You are quite a visited

35199
09:29:12,220 --> 09:29:12,960
my debt, Mr.

35200
09:29:12,960 --> 09:29:14,240
Bingley, she added.

35201
09:29:14,540 --> 09:29:14,940
But when you

35202
09:29:14,940 --> 09:29:15,500
went to town

35203
09:29:15,500 --> 09:29:16,100
last winter,

35204
09:29:16,100 --> 09:29:16,640
you promised to

35205
09:29:16,640 --> 09:29:17,480
take a family dinner

35206
09:29:17,480 --> 09:29:17,840
with us

35207
09:29:17,840 --> 09:29:19,000
as soon as you returned.

35208
09:29:19,000 --> 09:29:19,940
I have not forgot.

35209
09:29:19,940 --> 09:29:20,580
Do you see?

35210
09:29:20,580 --> 09:29:21,540
And I assure you,

35211
09:29:21,540 --> 09:29:22,100
I was very

35212
09:29:22,100 --> 09:29:22,920
much disappointed

35213
09:29:22,920 --> 09:29:23,280
that you did

35214
09:29:23,280 --> 09:29:23,900
not come back

35215
09:29:23,900 --> 09:29:24,220
and keep

35216
09:29:24,220 --> 09:29:25,440
your engagement.

35217
09:29:25,820 --> 09:29:26,480
Bingley looked

35218
09:29:26,480 --> 09:29:27,120
a little silly

35219
09:29:27,120 --> 09:29:28,140
at this reflection

35220
09:29:28,140 --> 09:29:28,920
and said something

35221
09:29:28,920 --> 09:29:29,540
of his concern

35222
09:29:29,540 --> 09:29:30,020
at having been

35223
09:29:30,020 --> 09:29:31,220
prevented by business.

35224
09:29:31,540 --> 09:29:32,780
Then they went away.

35225
09:29:33,680 --> 09:29:34,040
Mrs.

35226
09:29:34,040 --> 09:29:34,640
Bennett had been

35227
09:29:34,640 --> 09:29:35,480
strongly inclined

35228
09:29:35,480 --> 09:29:36,000
to ask them

35229
09:29:36,000 --> 09:29:36,920
to stay and dine there

35230
09:29:36,920 --> 09:29:37,720
that day.

35231
09:29:37,720 --> 09:29:38,100
But though

35232
09:29:38,100 --> 09:29:38,840
she always kept

35233
09:29:38,840 --> 09:29:39,900
a very good table.

35234
09:29:39,900 --> 09:29:40,340
She did not.

35235
09:29:40,340 --> 09:29:40,940
Think anything

35236
09:29:40,940 --> 09:29:42,140
less than two courses

35237
09:29:42,140 --> 09:29:42,780
could be good enough

35238
09:29:42,780 --> 09:29:43,520
for a man on whom

35239
09:29:43,520 --> 09:29:44,060
she had such

35240
09:29:44,060 --> 09:29:45,260
anxious designs

35241
09:29:45,320 --> 09:29:46,000
or satisfy

35242
09:29:46,000 --> 09:29:46,680
the appetite

35243
09:29:46,680 --> 09:29:47,940
and pride of one who

35244
09:29:47,940 --> 09:29:49,620
had 10,000 a year.

35245
09:29:52,160 --> 09:29:53,360
Chapter 54.

35246
09:29:54,560 --> 09:29:55,040
As soon as

35247
09:29:55,040 --> 09:29:55,700
they were gone,

35248
09:29:55,700 --> 09:29:56,680
Elizabeth walked out

35249
09:29:56,680 --> 09:29:57,900
to recover her spirits,

35250
09:29:58,160 --> 09:29:59,120
or, in other words, to

35251
09:29:59,120 --> 09:29:59,420
dwell

35252
09:29:59,420 --> 09:30:00,320
without interruption

35253
09:30:00,320 --> 09:30:01,180
on those subjects

35254
09:30:01,180 --> 09:30:01,580
that must

35255
09:30:01,580 --> 09:30:02,780
deaden them more.

35256
09:30:02,820 --> 09:30:03,120
Mr.

35257
09:30:03,120 --> 09:30:03,600
Darcy's

35258
09:30:03,600 --> 09:30:04,860
behavior, astonished

35259
09:30:04,860 --> 09:30:06,060
and vexed her.

35260
09:30:06,500 --> 09:30:07,580
Why, if he came

35261
09:30:07,580 --> 09:30:08,540
only to be silent,

35262
09:30:08,540 --> 09:30:09,860
grave and indifferent

35263
09:30:10,080 --> 09:30:11,120
said she, did

35264
09:30:11,120 --> 09:30:12,320
he come at all.

35265
09:30:12,660 --> 09:30:13,540
She could settle it in

35266
09:30:13,540 --> 09:30:14,040
no way.

35267
09:30:14,040 --> 09:30:15,240
That gave her pleasure.

35268
09:30:15,540 --> 09:30:16,100
He could be

35269
09:30:16,100 --> 09:30:17,100
still amiable,

35270
09:30:17,100 --> 09:30:17,960
still pleasing

35271
09:30:17,960 --> 09:30:18,540
to my uncle

35272
09:30:18,540 --> 09:30:18,980
and aunt

35273
09:30:18,980 --> 09:30:20,160
when he was in town.

35274
09:30:20,160 --> 09:30:21,360
And why not to me?

35275
09:30:21,660 --> 09:30:22,540
If he fears me,

35276
09:30:22,540 --> 09:30:23,760
why come hither?

35277
09:30:23,840 --> 09:30:24,980
If he no longer cares

35278
09:30:24,980 --> 09:30:25,260
for me?

35279
09:30:25,260 --> 09:30:25,520
Why?

35280
09:30:25,520 --> 09:30:27,380
Silent, teasing,

35281
09:30:27,480 --> 09:30:28,680
teasing man,

35282
09:30:28,880 --> 09:30:29,320
I will think

35283
09:30:29,320 --> 09:30:30,540
no more about him.

35284
09:30:31,100 --> 09:30:31,860
Her resolution

35285
09:30:31,860 --> 09:30:32,660
was for a short

35286
09:30:32,660 --> 09:30:34,100
time, involuntarily kept

35287
09:30:34,100 --> 09:30:34,680
by the approach

35288
09:30:34,680 --> 09:30:35,600
of her sister,

35289
09:30:35,600 --> 09:30:36,260
who joined her

35290
09:30:36,260 --> 09:30:36,780
with a cheerful

35291
09:30:36,780 --> 09:30:37,760
look which showed

35292
09:30:37,760 --> 09:30:38,180
her better

35293
09:30:38,180 --> 09:30:38,720
satisfied

35294
09:30:38,720 --> 09:30:39,500
with her visitors

35295
09:30:39,500 --> 09:30:40,700
than Elizabeth.

35296
09:30:40,920 --> 09:30:42,300
No, said she,

35297
09:30:42,540 --> 09:30:43,720
that this first meeting

35298
09:30:43,720 --> 09:30:44,160
is over.

35299
09:30:44,160 --> 09:30:45,740
I feel perfectly easy.

35300
09:30:46,140 --> 09:30:47,480
I know my own strength

35301
09:30:47,660 --> 09:30:48,540
and I shall never be.

35302
09:30:48,540 --> 09:30:49,320
Embarrassed again

35303
09:30:49,320 --> 09:30:50,480
by his coming.

35304
09:30:50,480 --> 09:30:51,480
I am glad he dines

35305
09:30:51,480 --> 09:30:52,620
here on Tuesday.

35306
09:30:52,620 --> 09:30:52,980
It will

35307
09:30:52,980 --> 09:30:54,200
then be publicly seen

35308
09:30:54,200 --> 09:30:55,400
that on both sides

35309
09:30:55,620 --> 09:30:56,820
we meet only as common.

35310
09:30:56,820 --> 09:30:57,300
An indifferent

35311
09:30:57,300 --> 09:30:58,500
acquaintance.

35312
09:30:58,680 --> 09:31:00,320
Yes Very indifferent

35313
09:31:00,320 --> 09:31:01,580
indeed, said

35314
09:31:01,580 --> 09:31:02,780
Elizabeth laughingly.

35315
09:31:03,000 --> 09:31:04,160
Oh, Jane, Take

35316
09:31:04,160 --> 09:31:05,360
care.

35317
09:31:05,460 --> 09:31:05,900
My dear

35318
09:31:05,900 --> 09:31:06,600
Lizzie,

35319
09:31:06,600 --> 09:31:07,400
you cannot think me

35320
09:31:07,400 --> 09:31:07,980
so weak

35321
09:31:07,980 --> 09:31:09,320
as to be in danger Now.

35322
09:31:10,140 --> 09:31:10,880
I think you are

35323
09:31:10,880 --> 09:31:12,080
in very great danger

35324
09:31:12,080 --> 09:31:12,600
of making him

35325
09:31:12,600 --> 09:31:13,360
as much in love

35326
09:31:13,360 --> 09:31:14,580
with you as ever.

35327
09:31:14,840 --> 09:31:15,380
They did not.

35328
09:31:15,380 --> 09:31:16,320
See the gentleman again

35329
09:31:16,320 --> 09:31:17,280
until Tuesday.

35330
09:31:17,280 --> 09:31:17,840
And Mrs.

35331
09:31:17,840 --> 09:31:18,320
Bennett, in

35332
09:31:18,320 --> 09:31:19,640
the meanwhile, was way

35333
09:31:19,640 --> 09:31:20,120
to all the

35334
09:31:20,120 --> 09:31:21,000
happy schemes,

35335
09:31:21,000 --> 09:31:21,900
which the good humor

35336
09:31:21,900 --> 09:31:22,400
and common

35337
09:31:22,400 --> 09:31:23,580
politeness of Bingley

35338
09:31:23,580 --> 09:31:24,360
in half an hour's

35339
09:31:24,360 --> 09:31:25,560
visit had revived.

35340
09:31:26,220 --> 09:31:27,020
On Tuesday,

35341
09:31:27,020 --> 09:31:27,960
there was a large party

35342
09:31:27,960 --> 09:31:29,160
assembled at Long Bourne

35343
09:31:29,280 --> 09:31:29,960
and the two,

35344
09:31:29,960 --> 09:31:30,360
who are most

35345
09:31:30,360 --> 09:31:31,560
anxiously expected

35346
09:31:31,620 --> 09:31:32,240
to the credit

35347
09:31:32,240 --> 09:31:33,180
of their punctuality

35348
09:31:33,180 --> 09:31:34,100
as sportsman,

35349
09:31:34,100 --> 09:31:35,380
were in very good time

35350
09:31:35,660 --> 09:31:36,420
when they repaired

35351
09:31:36,420 --> 09:31:37,400
to the dining room.

35352
09:31:37,400 --> 09:31:38,320
Elizabeth eagerly

35353
09:31:38,320 --> 09:31:39,020
watched to

35354
09:31:39,020 --> 09:31:39,600
whether Bingley

35355
09:31:39,600 --> 09:31:40,520
would take the place,

35356
09:31:40,520 --> 09:31:41,160
which in

35357
09:31:41,160 --> 09:31:42,260
all their former parties

35358
09:31:42,260 --> 09:31:43,280
had belonged to him

35359
09:31:43,280 --> 09:31:44,480
by her sister,

35360
09:31:44,600 --> 09:31:45,600
her prudent mother,

35361
09:31:45,600 --> 09:31:46,140
occupied

35362
09:31:46,140 --> 09:31:47,300
by the same ideas

35363
09:31:47,300 --> 09:31:48,420
for board to invite him

35364
09:31:48,420 --> 09:31:49,620
to sit by herself.

35365
09:31:49,760 --> 09:31:50,000
On.

35366
09:31:50,000 --> 09:31:50,780
Entering the room,

35367
09:31:50,780 --> 09:31:51,960
he seemed to hesitate.

35368
09:31:51,960 --> 09:31:52,820
But Jane happened

35369
09:31:52,820 --> 09:31:53,600
to look round

35370
09:31:53,600 --> 09:31:54,800
and happened to smile.

35371
09:31:55,000 --> 09:31:56,220
It was decided

35372
09:31:56,280 --> 09:31:57,220
he placed himself

35373
09:31:57,220 --> 09:31:58,440
by her.

35374
09:31:58,580 --> 09:31:59,180
Elizabeth,

35375
09:31:59,180 --> 09:31:59,360
with a

35376
09:31:59,360 --> 09:32:00,540
triumphant sensation,

35377
09:32:00,540 --> 09:32:01,260
looked towards

35378
09:32:01,260 --> 09:32:02,160
his friend.

35379
09:32:02,160 --> 09:32:03,220
He bought with noble

35380
09:32:03,220 --> 09:32:03,980
indifference,

35381
09:32:03,980 --> 09:32:04,460
and she would

35382
09:32:04,460 --> 09:32:05,180
have imagined that

35383
09:32:05,180 --> 09:32:06,120
Bingley had received

35384
09:32:06,120 --> 09:32:06,660
his sanction

35385
09:32:06,660 --> 09:32:07,620
to be happy.

35386
09:32:07,620 --> 09:32:08,420
Had she not seen.

35387
09:32:08,420 --> 09:32:08,840
His eyes

35388
09:32:08,840 --> 09:32:09,740
likewise turned

35389
09:32:09,740 --> 09:32:10,360
towards Mr.

35390
09:32:10,360 --> 09:32:11,000
Darcy

35391
09:32:11,000 --> 09:32:11,320
with an

35392
09:32:11,320 --> 09:32:12,300
expression of half

35393
09:32:12,300 --> 09:32:13,500
laughing alarm.

35394
09:32:14,280 --> 09:32:14,960
His behavior

35395
09:32:14,960 --> 09:32:15,540
to her sister

35396
09:32:15,540 --> 09:32:16,040
was such

35397
09:32:16,040 --> 09:32:17,100
during dinnertime

35398
09:32:17,100 --> 09:32:17,580
as showed

35399
09:32:17,580 --> 09:32:18,780
an admiration of her,

35400
09:32:18,780 --> 09:32:19,500
which, though

35401
09:32:19,500 --> 09:32:20,220
more guarded

35402
09:32:20,220 --> 09:32:21,740
than formally persuaded

35403
09:32:21,740 --> 09:32:22,280
Elizabeth

35404
09:32:22,280 --> 09:32:22,860
that if left

35405
09:32:22,860 --> 09:32:24,020
wholly to himself.

35406
09:32:24,020 --> 09:32:24,480
Jane's.

35407
09:32:24,480 --> 09:32:25,700
Happiness and his own

35408
09:32:25,700 --> 09:32:26,000
would be

35409
09:32:26,000 --> 09:32:27,200
speedily secured,

35410
09:32:27,540 --> 09:32:28,440
though she dared not

35411
09:32:28,440 --> 09:32:29,000
depend upon

35412
09:32:29,000 --> 09:32:29,960
the consequence,

35413
09:32:29,960 --> 09:32:30,440
she yet

35414
09:32:30,440 --> 09:32:31,260
received pleasure

35415
09:32:31,260 --> 09:32:31,920
from observing

35416
09:32:31,920 --> 09:32:33,000
his behavior.

35417
09:32:33,000 --> 09:32:33,860
It gave her all

35418
09:32:33,860 --> 09:32:34,580
the animation

35419
09:32:34,580 --> 09:32:35,300
that her spirits

35420
09:32:35,300 --> 09:32:36,220
could boast for.

35421
09:32:36,220 --> 09:32:37,340
She was in no cheerful

35422
09:32:37,340 --> 09:32:38,500
humor. Mr.

35423
09:32:38,500 --> 09:32:39,500
Darcy was almost

35424
09:32:39,500 --> 09:32:40,260
as far from her

35425
09:32:40,260 --> 09:32:40,760
as the table

35426
09:32:40,760 --> 09:32:41,940
could divide them.

35427
09:32:41,940 --> 09:32:42,380
He was on

35428
09:32:42,380 --> 09:32:43,580
one side of her mother.

35429
09:32:43,820 --> 09:32:44,780
She knew how little

35430
09:32:44,780 --> 09:32:45,600
such a situation

35431
09:32:45,600 --> 09:32:46,800
would give pleasure to

35432
09:32:46,860 --> 09:32:47,240
or make

35433
09:32:47,240 --> 09:32:47,900
either appear

35434
09:32:47,900 --> 09:32:49,000
to advantage.

35435
09:32:49,000 --> 09:32:50,100
She was not near enough

35436
09:32:50,100 --> 09:32:50,460
to hear

35437
09:32:50,460 --> 09:32:51,660
any of their discourse,

35438
09:32:51,720 --> 09:32:52,180
but she could

35439
09:32:52,180 --> 09:32:53,000
see how seldom

35440
09:32:53,000 --> 09:32:54,120
they spoke to each other

35441
09:32:54,120 --> 09:32:55,500
and how formal and cold

35442
09:32:55,500 --> 09:32:56,100
was their manner.

35443
09:32:56,100 --> 09:32:57,300
Whenever did.

35444
09:32:57,320 --> 09:32:57,860
Her mother's

35445
09:32:57,860 --> 09:32:58,640
on graciousness,

35446
09:32:58,640 --> 09:32:59,300
made the sense

35447
09:32:59,300 --> 09:32:59,540
of what

35448
09:32:59,540 --> 09:33:00,080
they owed him

35449
09:33:00,080 --> 09:33:00,860
more painful

35450
09:33:00,860 --> 09:33:02,060
to Elizabeth's mind.

35451
09:33:02,180 --> 09:33:03,020
And she would at.

35452
09:33:03,020 --> 09:33:04,280
Times have give anything

35453
09:33:04,280 --> 09:33:04,940
to be privileged

35454
09:33:04,940 --> 09:33:05,580
to tell him that

35455
09:33:05,580 --> 09:33:06,320
his kindness

35456
09:33:06,320 --> 09:33:07,340
neither unknown

35457
09:33:07,340 --> 09:33:08,240
nor un felt

35458
09:33:08,240 --> 09:33:09,000
by the whole

35459
09:33:09,000 --> 09:33:10,200
of the family.

35460
09:33:10,680 --> 09:33:11,420
She was in hopes

35461
09:33:11,420 --> 09:33:11,640
that the.

35462
09:33:11,640 --> 09:33:12,440
Evening would afford

35463
09:33:12,440 --> 09:33:13,320
some opportunity

35464
09:33:13,320 --> 09:33:13,680
of bringing

35465
09:33:13,680 --> 09:33:14,540
them together,

35466
09:33:14,540 --> 09:33:15,120
that the whole of

35467
09:33:15,120 --> 09:33:16,320
the visit would not pass

35468
09:33:16,320 --> 09:33:17,160
without enabling them

35469
09:33:17,160 --> 09:33:18,140
to enter into something

35470
09:33:18,140 --> 09:33:19,340
more of conversation

35471
09:33:19,400 --> 09:33:19,880
than the mere

35472
09:33:19,880 --> 09:33:21,260
ceremonious salutation

35473
09:33:21,260 --> 09:33:22,460
attending his entrance.

35474
09:33:22,760 --> 09:33:24,180
Anxious and uneasy,

35475
09:33:24,360 --> 09:33:24,900
the period

35476
09:33:24,900 --> 09:33:25,460
which passed

35477
09:33:25,460 --> 09:33:26,400
in the drawing room

35478
09:33:26,400 --> 09:33:26,820
before the

35479
09:33:26,820 --> 09:33:27,800
gentleman came

35480
09:33:27,800 --> 09:33:29,120
was wearisome and dull

35481
09:33:29,120 --> 09:33:29,660
to a degree

35482
09:33:29,660 --> 09:33:30,140
that made her

35483
09:33:30,140 --> 09:33:31,340
almost uncivil.

35484
09:33:31,580 --> 09:33:32,460
She looked forward to

35485
09:33:32,460 --> 09:33:33,080
their entrance

35486
09:33:33,080 --> 09:33:33,900
as the point on which

35487
09:33:33,900 --> 09:33:34,620
all her chance

35488
09:33:34,620 --> 09:33:35,040
of pleasure

35489
09:33:35,040 --> 09:33:35,660
for the evening

35490
09:33:35,660 --> 09:33:36,860
must pend.

35491
09:33:37,260 --> 09:33:37,720
If he does

35492
09:33:37,720 --> 09:33:38,940
not come to me.

35493
09:33:38,940 --> 09:33:40,140
Then she said

35494
09:33:40,520 --> 09:33:41,280
I shall give him

35495
09:33:41,280 --> 09:33:42,480
up forever.

35496
09:33:42,660 --> 09:33:43,760
The gentleman came

35497
09:33:43,760 --> 09:33:44,360
and she thought

35498
09:33:44,360 --> 09:33:44,780
he looked.

35499
09:33:44,780 --> 09:33:45,360
As if he would

35500
09:33:45,360 --> 09:33:46,560
have answered her hopes.

35501
09:33:46,580 --> 09:33:47,780
But alas, the ladies

35502
09:33:47,780 --> 09:33:48,320
had crowded

35503
09:33:48,320 --> 09:33:49,040
round the table

35504
09:33:49,040 --> 09:33:49,680
where Miss Bennett

35505
09:33:49,680 --> 09:33:50,100
was making

35506
09:33:50,100 --> 09:33:51,320
tea and Elizabeth

35507
09:33:51,320 --> 09:33:52,520
pouring out the coffee

35508
09:33:52,520 --> 09:33:53,280
in so close

35509
09:33:53,280 --> 09:33:54,040
a confederacy

35510
09:33:54,040 --> 09:33:54,620
that there was not

35511
09:33:54,620 --> 09:33:55,820
a single vacancy near

35512
09:33:55,940 --> 09:33:56,180
which would

35513
09:33:56,180 --> 09:33:57,320
admit of a chair.

35514
09:33:57,320 --> 09:33:57,680
And on the

35515
09:33:57,680 --> 09:33:58,700
gentleman's approaching,

35516
09:33:58,700 --> 09:33:59,460
one of the girls

35517
09:33:59,460 --> 09:34:00,000
moved closer

35518
09:34:00,000 --> 09:34:00,560
to her than ever

35519
09:34:00,560 --> 09:34:01,760
and sat in a whisper.

35520
09:34:02,100 --> 09:34:02,940
The men shan't.

35521
09:34:02,940 --> 09:34:03,500
Come, in part,

35522
09:34:03,500 --> 09:34:04,640
as I am determined.

35523
09:34:04,640 --> 09:34:05,060
We want

35524
09:34:05,060 --> 09:34:06,260
none of them, do we?

35525
09:34:06,800 --> 09:34:07,940
Darcy had walked away

35526
09:34:07,940 --> 09:34:08,360
to another

35527
09:34:08,360 --> 09:34:09,220
part of the room.

35528
09:34:09,220 --> 09:34:09,920
She followed him

35529
09:34:09,920 --> 09:34:11,280
with her eyes, envied

35530
09:34:11,280 --> 09:34:12,040
everyone to whom

35531
09:34:12,040 --> 09:34:12,800
he spoke,

35532
09:34:12,800 --> 09:34:13,940
had scarcely patience

35533
09:34:13,940 --> 09:34:14,480
enough to help

35534
09:34:14,480 --> 09:34:15,680
anybody to coffee,

35535
09:34:15,720 --> 09:34:16,800
and then was enraged

35536
09:34:16,800 --> 09:34:17,580
against herself

35537
09:34:17,580 --> 09:34:18,780
for being so silly.

35538
09:34:19,280 --> 09:34:19,980
A man who.

35539
09:34:19,980 --> 09:34:21,300
Was once been refused.

35540
09:34:21,660 --> 09:34:22,540
How could I ever be

35541
09:34:22,540 --> 09:34:23,680
foolish enough to expect

35542
09:34:23,680 --> 09:34:24,900
a renewal of his love?

35543
09:34:25,220 --> 09:34:26,060
Is there one

35544
09:34:26,060 --> 09:34:26,840
among the sex

35545
09:34:26,840 --> 09:34:27,360
who could not

35546
09:34:27,360 --> 09:34:28,100
protest against

35547
09:34:28,100 --> 09:34:28,940
such a weakness

35548
09:34:28,940 --> 09:34:29,400
as a second.

35549
09:34:29,400 --> 09:34:29,820
Proposal

35550
09:34:29,820 --> 09:34:31,020
to the same woman?

35551
09:34:31,160 --> 09:34:31,680
There is no

35552
09:34:31,680 --> 09:34:32,500
indignity so.

35553
09:34:32,500 --> 09:34:32,900
Abhorrent

35554
09:34:32,900 --> 09:34:34,100
to that feelings.

35555
09:34:34,760 --> 09:34:35,660
She was revived

35556
09:34:35,660 --> 09:34:36,680
a little, however,

35557
09:34:36,680 --> 09:34:37,080
by his

35558
09:34:37,080 --> 09:34:37,620
bringing back

35559
09:34:37,620 --> 09:34:38,240
his coffee cup.

35560
09:34:38,240 --> 09:34:39,300
Himself and she.

35561
09:34:39,300 --> 09:34:39,620
Seized

35562
09:34:39,620 --> 09:34:40,320
the opportunity

35563
09:34:40,320 --> 09:34:41,520
of saying.

35564
09:34:41,540 --> 09:34:42,200
Is your sister

35565
09:34:42,200 --> 09:34:43,400
at Pemberley still?

35566
09:34:43,920 --> 09:34:44,660
Yes.

35567
09:34:44,660 --> 09:34:45,600
She will remain there

35568
09:34:45,600 --> 09:34:46,640
Christmas.

35569
09:34:46,640 --> 09:34:47,820
And quite alone.

35570
09:34:47,820 --> 09:34:48,220
Have all her

35571
09:34:48,220 --> 09:34:49,440
friends left her?

35572
09:34:49,800 --> 09:34:50,160
Mrs.

35573
09:34:50,160 --> 09:34:51,080
Amis's with her.

35574
09:34:51,080 --> 09:34:51,720
The others have gone

35575
09:34:51,720 --> 09:34:52,440
to Scarborough

35576
09:34:52,440 --> 09:34:53,640
these three weeks.

35577
09:34:54,140 --> 09:34:54,500
She could

35578
09:34:54,500 --> 09:34:55,700
think of nothing to say.

35579
09:34:55,860 --> 09:34:56,500
But if he wished

35580
09:34:56,500 --> 09:34:57,360
to converse with her,

35581
09:34:57,360 --> 09:34:57,820
he might have

35582
09:34:57,820 --> 09:34:59,040
better success.

35583
09:34:59,160 --> 09:34:59,840
He stood by.

35584
09:34:59,840 --> 09:35:00,220
Her, however,

35585
09:35:00,220 --> 09:35:00,860
for some minutes

35586
09:35:00,860 --> 09:35:01,800
in silence.

35587
09:35:01,800 --> 09:35:02,580
And at last

35588
09:35:02,580 --> 09:35:03,220
on, the young lady's

35589
09:35:03,220 --> 09:35:03,780
whispering to

35590
09:35:03,780 --> 09:35:04,800
Elizabeth again.

35591
09:35:04,800 --> 09:35:06,000
He walked away

35592
09:35:06,600 --> 09:35:07,460
when the two things.

35593
09:35:07,460 --> 09:35:08,160
Were removed

35594
09:35:08,160 --> 09:35:08,720
and the card

35595
09:35:08,720 --> 09:35:09,540
tables placed

35596
09:35:09,540 --> 09:35:10,760
and the ladies all rose.

35597
09:35:11,120 --> 09:35:12,120
And Elizabeth was then

35598
09:35:12,120 --> 09:35:12,660
hoping to be

35599
09:35:12,660 --> 09:35:13,680
joined by him

35600
09:35:13,680 --> 09:35:14,540
when all her views

35601
09:35:14,540 --> 09:35:15,200
were overthrown

35602
09:35:15,200 --> 09:35:15,800
by seeing him

35603
09:35:15,800 --> 09:35:16,460
fall victim

35604
09:35:16,460 --> 09:35:17,640
to her mother's rapacity

35605
09:35:17,640 --> 09:35:18,720
for whist players.

35606
09:35:18,720 --> 09:35:19,680
And in a few moments

35607
09:35:19,680 --> 09:35:20,240
after seated

35608
09:35:20,240 --> 09:35:20,680
with the rest

35609
09:35:20,680 --> 09:35:21,720
of the party,

35610
09:35:21,720 --> 09:35:22,540
she now lost

35611
09:35:22,540 --> 09:35:23,720
every expectation

35612
09:35:23,720 --> 09:35:24,660
of pleasure.

35613
09:35:24,660 --> 09:35:25,520
They were confined

35614
09:35:25,520 --> 09:35:26,180
for the evening

35615
09:35:26,180 --> 09:35:27,320
at two different tables,

35616
09:35:27,320 --> 09:35:27,800
and she had

35617
09:35:27,800 --> 09:35:28,760
nothing to hope

35618
09:35:28,760 --> 09:35:29,720
but that his eyes were

35619
09:35:29,720 --> 09:35:30,220
so often

35620
09:35:30,220 --> 09:35:31,000
turned towards her

35621
09:35:31,000 --> 09:35:31,980
side of the room

35622
09:35:31,980 --> 09:35:32,940
as to make him play

35623
09:35:32,940 --> 09:35:33,860
as unsuccessfully

35624
09:35:33,860 --> 09:35:35,040
as herself.

35625
09:35:35,040 --> 09:35:35,420
Mrs.

35626
09:35:35,420 --> 09:35:36,380
Bennett had designed

35627
09:35:36,380 --> 09:35:36,820
to keep the

35628
09:35:36,820 --> 09:35:37,500
two Netherfield

35629
09:35:37,500 --> 09:35:38,660
gentlemen to supper,

35630
09:35:38,660 --> 09:35:39,420
but their carriage

35631
09:35:39,420 --> 09:35:40,520
was unluckily ordered

35632
09:35:40,520 --> 09:35:41,040
before any

35633
09:35:41,040 --> 09:35:41,820
of the others,

35634
09:35:41,820 --> 09:35:42,480
and she had no

35635
09:35:42,480 --> 09:35:43,140
opportunity

35636
09:35:43,140 --> 09:35:43,680
of detaining.

35637
09:35:44,780 --> 09:35:46,440
Well, girls, said.

35638
09:35:46,440 --> 09:35:46,800
She, as

35639
09:35:46,800 --> 09:35:47,280
soon as they were

35640
09:35:47,280 --> 09:35:48,440
left to themselves.

35641
09:35:48,440 --> 09:35:49,680
What say you to the day?

35642
09:35:50,040 --> 09:35:51,040
I think everything

35643
09:35:51,040 --> 09:35:51,780
is passed off

35644
09:35:51,780 --> 09:35:52,860
uncommonly well,

35645
09:35:52,860 --> 09:35:54,260
I assure you that dinner

35646
09:35:54,260 --> 09:35:55,160
was as well dressed

35647
09:35:55,160 --> 09:35:56,360
as any I ever saw.

35648
09:35:56,420 --> 09:35:57,040
The venison

35649
09:35:57,040 --> 09:35:58,260
was roasting to a turn

35650
09:35:58,360 --> 09:35:59,320
and everybody said

35651
09:35:59,320 --> 09:36:00,040
they never saw

35652
09:36:00,040 --> 09:36:01,260
so fat a haunch.

35653
09:36:01,260 --> 09:36:02,680
The soup was 50 times

35654
09:36:02,680 --> 09:36:03,260
better than what

35655
09:36:03,260 --> 09:36:04,140
had at the Lucas's

35656
09:36:04,140 --> 09:36:04,940
last week.

35657
09:36:04,940 --> 09:36:05,860
And even Mr.

35658
09:36:05,860 --> 09:36:06,780
Darcy acknowledged

35659
09:36:06,780 --> 09:36:07,580
that the Partridges

35660
09:36:07,580 --> 09:36:08,320
was remarkably

35661
09:36:08,320 --> 09:36:09,020
well done.

35662
09:36:09,020 --> 09:36:09,620
And I suppose

35663
09:36:09,620 --> 09:36:10,640
he has two or three

35664
09:36:10,640 --> 09:36:11,320
French cooks

35665
09:36:11,320 --> 09:36:12,800
at least had my.

35666
09:36:13,180 --> 09:36:14,180
Jane, I never saw

35667
09:36:14,180 --> 09:36:14,780
you looking great.

35668
09:36:14,780 --> 09:36:15,600
A beauty.

35669
09:36:15,600 --> 09:36:15,980
Mrs.

35670
09:36:15,980 --> 09:36:17,120
Long said so too, for

35671
09:36:17,120 --> 09:36:17,600
I asked her

35672
09:36:17,600 --> 09:36:18,680
whether you did not.

35673
09:36:18,680 --> 09:36:19,460
And what do you think

35674
09:36:19,460 --> 09:36:20,660
she said besides?

35675
09:36:20,720 --> 09:36:21,480
Oh, Mrs.

35676
09:36:21,480 --> 09:36:22,960
Bennet, we shall have to

35677
09:36:22,980 --> 09:36:23,960
the field at last.

35678
09:36:23,960 --> 09:36:25,160
She did indeed.

35679
09:36:25,260 --> 09:36:26,300
I do think Mrs.

35680
09:36:26,300 --> 09:36:26,960
Long is as good

35681
09:36:26,960 --> 09:36:27,420
a creature

35682
09:36:27,420 --> 09:36:28,180
as ever lived,

35683
09:36:28,180 --> 09:36:29,240
and her nieces are

35684
09:36:29,240 --> 09:36:29,860
very pretty

35685
09:36:29,860 --> 09:36:30,620
behaved girls.

35686
09:36:30,620 --> 09:36:31,820
And not at all handsome.

35687
09:36:32,000 --> 09:36:32,680
I like them

35688
09:36:32,680 --> 09:36:33,900
prodigiously.

35689
09:36:34,340 --> 09:36:34,720
Mrs.

35690
09:36:34,720 --> 09:36:35,540
Bennet, in short,

35691
09:36:35,540 --> 09:36:35,780
was in

35692
09:36:35,780 --> 09:36:36,980
very great spirits.

35693
09:36:37,160 --> 09:36:38,100
She had seen enough of

35694
09:36:38,100 --> 09:36:38,840
Bayley's behavior

35695
09:36:38,840 --> 09:36:39,820
to Jane to be convinced

35696
09:36:39,820 --> 09:36:40,220
that she would

35697
09:36:40,220 --> 09:36:41,240
get in at last.

35698
09:36:41,240 --> 09:36:42,320
And her expectations

35699
09:36:42,320 --> 09:36:42,960
of advantage

35700
09:36:42,960 --> 09:36:43,860
to her family,

35701
09:36:43,860 --> 09:36:45,060
when in a happy humor,

35702
09:36:45,120 --> 09:36:45,860
were so far

35703
09:36:45,860 --> 09:36:46,620
beyond reason

35704
09:36:46,620 --> 09:36:47,000
that she was

35705
09:36:47,000 --> 09:36:48,000
quite disappointed at

35706
09:36:48,000 --> 09:36:48,600
not seeing him

35707
09:36:48,600 --> 09:36:49,820
there again the next day

35708
09:36:49,820 --> 09:36:51,020
to make his proposals.

35709
09:36:51,780 --> 09:36:52,260
It has

35710
09:36:52,260 --> 09:36:53,500
a very agreeable day.

35711
09:36:53,780 --> 09:36:54,260
Said Mrs.

35712
09:36:54,260 --> 09:36:55,460
Bennet to Elizabeth.

35713
09:36:55,500 --> 09:36:56,400
The party seemed so

35714
09:36:56,400 --> 09:36:57,380
well selected,

35715
09:36:57,380 --> 09:36:57,980
so suitable

35716
09:36:57,980 --> 09:36:58,880
with one another.

35717
09:36:58,880 --> 09:36:59,460
I hope we may

35718
09:36:59,460 --> 09:37:00,660
often meet again.

35719
09:37:00,980 --> 09:37:02,180
Elizabeth smiled.

35720
09:37:02,680 --> 09:37:03,180
Lizzie,

35721
09:37:03,180 --> 09:37:04,440
you must not do so.

35722
09:37:04,540 --> 09:37:05,840
You must not suspect me.

35723
09:37:06,000 --> 09:37:07,200
It mortified me.

35724
09:37:07,620 --> 09:37:08,300
I assure you

35725
09:37:08,300 --> 09:37:08,900
that I have now

35726
09:37:08,900 --> 09:37:09,620
learned to enjoy

35727
09:37:09,620 --> 09:37:10,400
this conversation

35728
09:37:10,400 --> 09:37:11,160
as an agreeable

35729
09:37:11,160 --> 09:37:12,360
and sensible young man

35730
09:37:12,500 --> 09:37:13,180
without having a

35731
09:37:13,180 --> 09:37:14,400
wish beyond it.

35732
09:37:14,500 --> 09:37:15,980
I am perfectly satisfied

35733
09:37:15,980 --> 09:37:16,360
from what.

35734
09:37:16,360 --> 09:37:17,580
His man is now.

35735
09:37:17,680 --> 09:37:18,320
That he had never

35736
09:37:18,320 --> 09:37:18,960
any design.

35737
09:37:18,960 --> 09:37:19,620
Of engaging my.

35738
09:37:19,620 --> 09:37:20,500
Affection.

35739
09:37:20,500 --> 09:37:21,140
It is only that

35740
09:37:21,140 --> 09:37:21,680
he is blessed

35741
09:37:21,680 --> 09:37:22,160
with greater

35742
09:37:22,160 --> 09:37:23,360
sweetness of address

35743
09:37:23,500 --> 09:37:24,500
and a stronger desire

35744
09:37:24,500 --> 09:37:25,460
of generally pleasing

35745
09:37:25,460 --> 09:37:26,660
than any other man.

35746
09:37:27,020 --> 09:37:28,680
You are very cruel.

35747
09:37:28,820 --> 09:37:30,020
Said her sister.

35748
09:37:30,020 --> 09:37:31,700
He will not let me smile

35749
09:37:31,700 --> 09:37:32,000
and to

35750
09:37:32,000 --> 09:37:32,860
provoking me to

35751
09:37:32,860 --> 09:37:34,080
at every moment

35752
09:37:34,700 --> 09:37:35,600
how hard it is

35753
09:37:35,600 --> 09:37:36,260
in some cases

35754
09:37:36,260 --> 09:37:37,460
to be believed

35755
09:37:37,520 --> 09:37:38,680
and how impossible

35756
09:37:38,680 --> 09:37:39,900
in others.

35757
09:37:39,920 --> 09:37:40,820
But why should you wish

35758
09:37:40,820 --> 09:37:41,540
to persuade me

35759
09:37:41,540 --> 09:37:42,200
that I feel more

35760
09:37:42,200 --> 09:37:43,400
than I acknowledge?

35761
09:37:43,800 --> 09:37:44,820
That is the question

35762
09:37:44,820 --> 09:37:45,740
which I hardly know

35763
09:37:45,740 --> 09:37:46,940
how to answer.

35764
09:37:47,040 --> 09:37:48,620
We all love to instruct

35765
09:37:48,780 --> 09:37:50,000
that we can teach only

35766
09:37:50,000 --> 09:37:50,540
what is not

35767
09:37:50,540 --> 09:37:51,740
worth knowing.

35768
09:37:51,820 --> 09:37:52,820
Forgive me.

35769
09:37:52,820 --> 09:37:53,780
And if you persist

35770
09:37:53,780 --> 09:37:54,480
in indifference,

35771
09:37:54,480 --> 09:37:55,140
do not make

35772
09:37:55,140 --> 09:37:56,360
me your confident.

35773
09:37:58,180 --> 09:37:59,460
Chapter 55.

35774
09:38:00,780 --> 09:38:01,500
A few days

35775
09:38:01,500 --> 09:38:02,760
after this visit, Mr.

35776
09:38:02,760 --> 09:38:03,960
Bingley called again

35777
09:38:04,040 --> 09:38:05,240
and alone.

35778
09:38:05,580 --> 09:38:06,800
His friend had left him

35779
09:38:06,800 --> 09:38:08,000
that morning for London,

35780
09:38:08,120 --> 09:38:09,380
but was to return home

35781
09:38:09,380 --> 09:38:10,580
in ten days time.

35782
09:38:10,860 --> 09:38:11,680
He sat with them

35783
09:38:11,680 --> 09:38:12,560
above an hour

35784
09:38:12,560 --> 09:38:13,640
and was in remarkably

35785
09:38:13,640 --> 09:38:14,820
good spirits.

35786
09:38:14,820 --> 09:38:15,200
Mrs.

35787
09:38:15,200 --> 09:38:15,560
Bennett

35788
09:38:15,560 --> 09:38:16,540
invited him to dine

35789
09:38:16,540 --> 09:38:17,460
with them. But.

35790
09:38:17,460 --> 09:38:18,420
With expressions

35791
09:38:18,420 --> 09:38:19,340
of concern.

35792
09:38:19,340 --> 09:38:20,400
He confessed himself

35793
09:38:20,400 --> 09:38:21,660
engaged elsewhere.

35794
09:38:22,280 --> 09:38:23,160
Next time

35795
09:38:23,160 --> 09:38:24,780
you call, said she.

35796
09:38:24,980 --> 09:38:25,980
I hope we shall be

35797
09:38:25,980 --> 09:38:27,180
more lucky.

35798
09:38:27,500 --> 09:38:27,980
He should be

35799
09:38:27,980 --> 09:38:28,680
particularly.

35800
09:38:28,680 --> 09:38:29,900
Happy at any time,

35801
09:38:29,900 --> 09:38:30,920
etc., etc..

35802
09:38:30,920 --> 09:38:31,540
And if she would

35803
09:38:31,540 --> 09:38:31,860
give him

35804
09:38:31,860 --> 09:38:32,460
leave,

35805
09:38:32,460 --> 09:38:32,860
would take

35806
09:38:32,860 --> 09:38:33,960
an early opportunity

35807
09:38:33,960 --> 09:38:35,160
of waiting on them.

35808
09:38:35,460 --> 09:38:36,660
Can you come tomorrow?

35809
09:38:37,160 --> 09:38:37,680
Yes.

35810
09:38:37,680 --> 09:38:38,680
He had no engagement

35811
09:38:38,680 --> 09:38:39,900
at all for tomorrow,

35812
09:38:39,900 --> 09:38:40,820
and her invitation

35813
09:38:40,820 --> 09:38:41,500
was accepted

35814
09:38:41,500 --> 09:38:42,720
with alacrity.

35815
09:38:42,980 --> 09:38:43,640
He came

35816
09:38:43,640 --> 09:38:44,180
and in such

35817
09:38:44,180 --> 09:38:45,040
very good time

35818
09:38:45,040 --> 09:38:45,780
that the ladies were

35819
09:38:45,780 --> 09:38:46,980
none of them dressed

35820
09:38:46,980 --> 09:38:47,840
in ran Mrs.

35821
09:38:47,840 --> 09:38:48,140
Bennett

35822
09:38:48,140 --> 09:38:49,080
to her daughter's room

35823
09:38:49,080 --> 09:38:50,000
in her dressing gown

35824
09:38:50,000 --> 09:38:50,900
and with her hair half

35825
09:38:50,900 --> 09:38:52,100
finished, crying out.

35826
09:38:52,440 --> 09:38:53,240
My dear Jane,

35827
09:38:53,240 --> 09:38:53,780
make haste

35828
09:38:53,780 --> 09:38:54,560
and hurry down.

35829
09:38:54,560 --> 09:38:55,340
He has come.

35830
09:38:55,340 --> 09:38:55,620
Mr.

35831
09:38:55,620 --> 09:38:56,600
Bingley has come.

35832
09:38:56,600 --> 09:38:57,660
He is indeed.

35833
09:38:57,660 --> 09:38:58,220
Make haste.

35834
09:38:58,220 --> 09:38:59,100
Make haste.

35835
09:38:59,100 --> 09:38:59,680
He is Sarah.

35836
09:38:59,680 --> 09:39:00,180
Come to miss.

35837
09:39:00,180 --> 09:39:00,920
Spend at this moment

35838
09:39:00,920 --> 09:39:01,580
and help her on

35839
09:39:01,580 --> 09:39:02,160
with her gown.

35840
09:39:02,160 --> 09:39:02,780
Never mind this

35841
09:39:02,780 --> 09:39:03,980
Lizzie's hair.

35842
09:39:04,280 --> 09:39:05,100
We will be down

35843
09:39:05,100 --> 09:39:06,300
as soon as we can,

35844
09:39:06,380 --> 09:39:07,340
said Jane.

35845
09:39:07,340 --> 09:39:08,220
But I dare say

35846
09:39:08,220 --> 09:39:09,040
Kitty is forward

35847
09:39:09,040 --> 09:39:10,160
it in either of us

35848
09:39:10,160 --> 09:39:10,500
because she

35849
09:39:10,500 --> 09:39:11,180
went upstairs

35850
09:39:11,180 --> 09:39:12,380
half an hour ago.

35851
09:39:12,660 --> 09:39:13,720
Oh, hang, Kitty.

35852
09:39:13,720 --> 09:39:14,180
What has she

35853
09:39:14,180 --> 09:39:14,900
to do with it?

35854
09:39:14,900 --> 09:39:15,600
Come, be quick.

35855
09:39:15,600 --> 09:39:16,340
Be.

35856
09:39:16,340 --> 09:39:17,120
When is your sash,

35857
09:39:17,120 --> 09:39:18,320
my dear?

35858
09:39:18,320 --> 09:39:18,820
But when her

35859
09:39:18,820 --> 09:39:19,820
mother was gone,

35860
09:39:19,820 --> 09:39:20,600
Jane would not

35861
09:39:20,600 --> 09:39:21,180
be prevailed

35862
09:39:21,180 --> 09:39:21,900
on to go down

35863
09:39:21,900 --> 09:39:22,440
without one of

35864
09:39:22,440 --> 09:39:23,640
her sisters.

35865
09:39:23,860 --> 09:39:24,920
The same anxiety

35866
09:39:24,920 --> 09:39:25,540
to get them by

35867
09:39:25,540 --> 09:39:26,220
themselves was

35868
09:39:26,220 --> 09:39:27,020
was visible again

35869
09:39:27,020 --> 09:39:27,980
in the evening

35870
09:39:27,980 --> 09:39:29,040
after tea, Mr.

35871
09:39:29,040 --> 09:39:29,660
Bennett retired

35872
09:39:29,660 --> 09:39:30,480
to the library,

35873
09:39:30,480 --> 09:39:31,680
as was his custom,

35874
09:39:31,680 --> 09:39:32,960
and Mary went upstairs

35875
09:39:32,960 --> 09:39:34,160
to her instrument

35876
09:39:34,180 --> 09:39:35,300
to obstacles of the

35877
09:39:35,300 --> 09:39:36,680
five being removed.

35878
09:39:36,860 --> 09:39:37,260
Mrs.

35879
09:39:37,260 --> 09:39:38,240
Bennett sat down

35880
09:39:38,240 --> 09:39:39,380
and winking at Elizabeth

35881
09:39:39,380 --> 09:39:39,980
and Catherine

35882
09:39:39,980 --> 09:39:41,180
for a considerable time

35883
09:39:41,320 --> 09:39:42,040
without making

35884
09:39:42,040 --> 09:39:43,260
any impression on them.

35885
09:39:43,460 --> 09:39:44,320
Elizabeth would not

35886
09:39:44,320 --> 09:39:45,120
observe her.

35887
09:39:45,120 --> 09:39:45,960
And when at last.

35888
09:39:45,960 --> 09:39:46,980
Kitty did, she.

35889
09:39:46,980 --> 09:39:48,180
Very innocently said.

35890
09:39:48,620 --> 09:39:49,800
What's the matter, Mama?

35891
09:39:49,800 --> 09:39:50,460
What do you keep

35892
09:39:50,460 --> 09:39:51,500
winking at me for?

35893
09:39:51,500 --> 09:39:52,700
What am I to do?

35894
09:39:53,400 --> 09:39:54,320
Nothing, child.

35895
09:39:54,320 --> 09:39:54,980
Nothing.

35896
09:39:54,980 --> 09:39:56,240
I did not wink at you.

35897
09:39:56,860 --> 09:39:57,720
She then sat

35898
09:39:57,720 --> 09:39:59,060
still 5 minutes longer,

35899
09:39:59,240 --> 09:40:00,500
but unable to waste

35900
09:40:00,500 --> 09:40:00,780
such a

35901
09:40:00,780 --> 09:40:01,860
precious occasion.

35902
09:40:01,860 --> 09:40:02,940
She suddenly got up

35903
09:40:02,940 --> 09:40:04,140
and saying to Kitty.

35904
09:40:04,280 --> 09:40:05,160
Come here, my love.

35905
09:40:05,160 --> 09:40:06,360
I want to speak you.

35906
09:40:06,440 --> 09:40:06,800
Took her

35907
09:40:06,800 --> 09:40:08,000
out of the room.

35908
09:40:08,000 --> 09:40:08,840
Jane instantly

35909
09:40:08,840 --> 09:40:09,320
gave a look

35910
09:40:09,320 --> 09:40:09,900
at Elizabeth,

35911
09:40:09,900 --> 09:40:11,040
which spoke her distress

35912
09:40:11,040 --> 09:40:12,240
at such premeditation

35913
09:40:12,420 --> 09:40:13,320
and her entreaty

35914
09:40:13,320 --> 09:40:13,920
that she would

35915
09:40:13,920 --> 09:40:15,120
not give in to it

35916
09:40:15,200 --> 09:40:16,040
in a few minutes.

35917
09:40:16,040 --> 09:40:16,340
Mrs.

35918
09:40:16,340 --> 09:40:16,880
Bennett half

35919
09:40:16,880 --> 09:40:17,500
opened the door

35920
09:40:17,500 --> 09:40:18,540
and called out.

35921
09:40:18,540 --> 09:40:19,360
Lizzie, my dear,

35922
09:40:19,360 --> 09:40:20,040
I want to speak

35923
09:40:20,040 --> 09:40:21,140
with you.

35924
09:40:21,140 --> 09:40:21,820
Elizabeth was

35925
09:40:21,820 --> 09:40:23,040
forced to go.

35926
09:40:23,120 --> 09:40:23,860
We may as well

35927
09:40:23,860 --> 09:40:24,220
leave them

35928
09:40:24,220 --> 09:40:24,820
by themselves.

35929
09:40:24,820 --> 09:40:25,520
You know.

35930
09:40:25,520 --> 09:40:26,220
Said her mother,

35931
09:40:26,220 --> 09:40:26,780
as soon as she was

35932
09:40:26,780 --> 09:40:27,600
in the hall.

35933
09:40:27,600 --> 09:40:27,980
Kitty

35934
09:40:27,980 --> 09:40:29,100
and I are going upstairs

35935
09:40:29,100 --> 09:40:29,300
to sit

35936
09:40:29,300 --> 09:40:30,500
in my dressing room.

35937
09:40:30,860 --> 09:40:31,620
Elizabeth made

35938
09:40:31,620 --> 09:40:32,500
no attempt to reason

35939
09:40:32,500 --> 09:40:33,180
with her mother,

35940
09:40:33,180 --> 09:40:33,780
but remained

35941
09:40:33,780 --> 09:40:34,980
quietly in the hall

35942
09:40:35,000 --> 09:40:35,420
till she

35943
09:40:35,420 --> 09:40:35,860
and Kitty

35944
09:40:35,860 --> 09:40:36,780
were out of sight,

35945
09:40:36,780 --> 09:40:37,520
then returned

35946
09:40:37,520 --> 09:40:38,720
to the drawing room.

35947
09:40:39,020 --> 09:40:39,380
Mrs.

35948
09:40:39,380 --> 09:40:40,460
Bennett's schemes for

35949
09:40:40,460 --> 09:40:40,800
the day

35950
09:40:40,800 --> 09:40:41,940
were ineffectual.

35951
09:40:41,940 --> 09:40:43,160
Bingley was everything

35952
09:40:43,160 --> 09:40:44,120
that was charming,

35953
09:40:44,120 --> 09:40:45,300
except The professed

35954
09:40:45,300 --> 09:40:46,500
lover of her daughter.

35955
09:40:46,640 --> 09:40:47,300
His ease

35956
09:40:47,300 --> 09:40:48,120
and cheerfulness

35957
09:40:48,120 --> 09:40:48,560
rendered him

35958
09:40:48,560 --> 09:40:48,920
a most

35959
09:40:48,920 --> 09:40:49,800
agreeable addition

35960
09:40:49,800 --> 09:40:51,000
to their evening party.

35961
09:40:51,040 --> 09:40:51,420
And he.

35962
09:40:51,420 --> 09:40:51,980
Bore with the

35963
09:40:51,980 --> 09:40:52,980
ill judged officious

35964
09:40:52,980 --> 09:40:53,900
ness of the mother

35965
09:40:53,900 --> 09:40:54,420
and heard

35966
09:40:54,420 --> 09:40:55,540
all her silly remarks

35967
09:40:55,540 --> 09:40:56,420
with a forbearance

35968
09:40:56,420 --> 09:40:57,000
and command

35969
09:40:57,000 --> 09:40:57,820
of countenance,

35970
09:40:57,820 --> 09:40:59,000
particularly grateful

35971
09:40:59,000 --> 09:41:00,200
to the daughter,

35972
09:41:00,360 --> 09:41:01,440
he scarcely needed

35973
09:41:01,440 --> 09:41:02,160
an invitation

35974
09:41:02,160 --> 09:41:03,180
to stay supper,

35975
09:41:03,180 --> 09:41:04,440
and before he went away

35976
09:41:04,440 --> 09:41:05,660
an engagement was formed

35977
09:41:05,840 --> 09:41:07,000
chiefly through his own

35978
09:41:07,000 --> 09:41:07,360
and Mrs.

35979
09:41:07,360 --> 09:41:08,360
Bennett's means

35980
09:41:08,360 --> 09:41:09,080
for his coming

35981
09:41:09,080 --> 09:41:09,740
next morning

35982
09:41:09,740 --> 09:41:10,260
to shoot

35983
09:41:10,260 --> 09:41:11,460
with her husband.

35984
09:41:11,600 --> 09:41:12,600
After this day,

35985
09:41:12,600 --> 09:41:13,160
Jane said

35986
09:41:13,160 --> 09:41:14,360
no more of indifference.

35987
09:41:14,640 --> 09:41:15,600
Not a word passed

35988
09:41:15,600 --> 09:41:16,340
between the sisters

35989
09:41:16,340 --> 09:41:17,480
concerning Bingley.

35990
09:41:17,480 --> 09:41:18,200
But Elizabeth

35991
09:41:18,200 --> 09:41:18,800
went to bed

35992
09:41:18,800 --> 09:41:19,680
in the happy belief

35993
09:41:19,680 --> 09:41:20,940
that all must speedily

35994
09:41:20,940 --> 09:41:22,860
be concluded unless Mr.

35995
09:41:22,860 --> 09:41:23,760
Darcy returned

35996
09:41:23,760 --> 09:41:24,960
within the stated time.

35997
09:41:25,340 --> 09:41:26,400
Seriously, however,

35998
09:41:26,400 --> 09:41:26,820
she felt

35999
09:41:26,820 --> 09:41:27,820
tolerably persuaded

36000
09:41:27,820 --> 09:41:28,280
that all

36001
09:41:28,280 --> 09:41:28,880
this must have

36002
09:41:28,880 --> 09:41:29,480
taken place

36003
09:41:29,480 --> 09:41:29,840
with that

36004
09:41:29,840 --> 09:41:31,040
gentleman's concurrence.

36005
09:41:31,720 --> 09:41:32,860
Bingley was punctual

36006
09:41:32,860 --> 09:41:33,920
to his appointment,

36007
09:41:33,920 --> 09:41:34,720
and he and Mr.

36008
09:41:34,720 --> 09:41:35,280
Bennett spent

36009
09:41:35,280 --> 09:41:36,120
the morning together,

36010
09:41:36,120 --> 09:41:37,320
as had been agreed on.

36011
09:41:37,440 --> 09:41:38,360
The latter was much

36012
09:41:38,360 --> 09:41:39,020
more agreeable

36013
09:41:39,020 --> 09:41:39,740
than his companion

36014
09:41:39,740 --> 09:41:40,680
expected.

36015
09:41:40,680 --> 09:41:41,320
There was nothing

36016
09:41:41,320 --> 09:41:42,000
of presumption

36017
09:41:42,000 --> 09:41:42,960
or folly in Bingley

36018
09:41:42,960 --> 09:41:43,640
that could provoke

36019
09:41:43,640 --> 09:41:44,460
his ridicule

36020
09:41:44,460 --> 09:41:45,220
or disgust him

36021
09:41:45,220 --> 09:41:46,180
into silence,

36022
09:41:46,180 --> 09:41:46,700
and he was

36023
09:41:46,700 --> 09:41:47,540
more communicative

36024
09:41:47,540 --> 09:41:48,600
and less eccentric

36025
09:41:48,600 --> 09:41:49,080
than the other

36026
09:41:49,080 --> 09:41:50,280
had ever seen him.

36027
09:41:50,320 --> 09:41:51,120
Bingley, of course,

36028
09:41:51,120 --> 09:41:51,740
returned with him

36029
09:41:51,740 --> 09:41:52,340
to dinner.

36030
09:41:52,340 --> 09:41:52,800
And in the.

36031
09:41:52,800 --> 09:41:53,480
Evening Mrs.

36032
09:41:53,480 --> 09:41:54,260
Bennett's invention

36033
09:41:54,260 --> 09:41:55,100
was again at work

36034
09:41:55,100 --> 09:41:55,800
to get everybody

36035
09:41:55,800 --> 09:41:56,360
away from him

36036
09:41:56,360 --> 09:41:56,540
And her

36037
09:41:56,540 --> 09:41:58,080
daughter Elizabeth,

36038
09:41:58,080 --> 09:41:58,680
who had a letter

36039
09:41:58,680 --> 09:41:59,240
to write,

36040
09:41:59,240 --> 09:41:59,760
went into the

36041
09:41:59,760 --> 09:42:00,380
breakfast room

36042
09:42:00,380 --> 09:42:01,100
for that purpose.

36043
09:42:01,100 --> 09:42:02,220
Soon after tea.

36044
09:42:02,220 --> 09:42:03,180
For as the others

36045
09:42:03,180 --> 09:42:03,560
all going

36046
09:42:03,560 --> 09:42:04,760
to sit down to cards.

36047
09:42:04,800 --> 09:42:05,840
She could not be wanted.

36048
09:42:05,840 --> 09:42:06,660
To counteract her

36049
09:42:06,660 --> 09:42:07,860
mother's schemes.

36050
09:42:08,160 --> 09:42:08,900
But on returning.

36051
09:42:08,900 --> 09:42:09,680
To the drawing room

36052
09:42:09,680 --> 09:42:10,220
when her letter

36053
09:42:10,220 --> 09:42:11,540
was finished, she saw,

36054
09:42:11,540 --> 09:42:11,780
to her

36055
09:42:11,780 --> 09:42:12,920
infinite surprise,

36056
09:42:12,920 --> 09:42:13,980
there was reason to fear

36057
09:42:13,980 --> 09:42:14,460
that her mother

36058
09:42:14,460 --> 09:42:15,540
had been too ingenious

36059
09:42:15,540 --> 09:42:16,260
for her.

36060
09:42:16,260 --> 09:42:17,240
On opening the door,

36061
09:42:17,240 --> 09:42:17,960
she perceived her

36062
09:42:17,960 --> 09:42:18,900
sister and Bingley,

36063
09:42:18,900 --> 09:42:19,720
standing together

36064
09:42:19,720 --> 09:42:20,640
over the hearth

36065
09:42:20,640 --> 09:42:21,560
as if engaged in

36066
09:42:21,560 --> 09:42:22,760
earnest conversation,

36067
09:42:23,000 --> 09:42:23,940
and had this led

36068
09:42:23,940 --> 09:42:25,000
to no suspicion.

36069
09:42:25,000 --> 09:42:26,180
The faces of both,

36070
09:42:26,180 --> 09:42:26,500
as they

36071
09:42:26,500 --> 09:42:27,560
hastily turned round

36072
09:42:27,560 --> 09:42:28,100
and moved away

36073
09:42:28,100 --> 09:42:28,860
from each other,

36074
09:42:28,860 --> 09:42:30,060
would have told it all.

36075
09:42:30,320 --> 09:42:31,140
Their situation

36076
09:42:31,140 --> 09:42:32,180
was awkward enough,

36077
09:42:32,180 --> 09:42:33,120
but hers

36078
09:42:33,120 --> 09:42:34,320
thought was still worse.

36079
09:42:34,520 --> 09:42:35,400
Not a syllable

36080
09:42:35,400 --> 09:42:36,600
was uttered by either,

36081
09:42:36,620 --> 09:42:37,280
and Elizabeth

36082
09:42:37,280 --> 09:42:37,880
was on the point

36083
09:42:37,880 --> 09:42:38,460
of going away.

36084
09:42:38,460 --> 09:42:39,300
Again when.

36085
09:42:39,300 --> 09:42:39,800
Bingley,

36086
09:42:39,800 --> 09:42:40,520
who as well

36087
09:42:40,520 --> 09:42:41,160
as the other, had

36088
09:42:41,160 --> 09:42:42,500
sat down, suddenly

36089
09:42:42,500 --> 09:42:43,800
rose and whispering

36090
09:42:43,800 --> 09:42:44,460
a few words

36091
09:42:44,460 --> 09:42:45,200
to her sister,

36092
09:42:45,200 --> 09:42:46,400
ran out of the room.

36093
09:42:46,920 --> 09:42:47,720
Jane could have

36094
09:42:47,720 --> 09:42:48,380
no reserves

36095
09:42:48,380 --> 09:42:49,080
from Elizabeth,

36096
09:42:49,080 --> 09:42:49,820
where confidence

36097
09:42:49,820 --> 09:42:50,860
would give pleasure

36098
09:42:50,860 --> 09:42:51,600
and instantly

36099
09:42:51,600 --> 09:42:52,340
embracing her,

36100
09:42:52,340 --> 09:42:53,100
acknowledged

36101
09:42:53,100 --> 09:42:54,300
the liveliest emotion

36102
09:42:54,420 --> 09:42:54,820
that she was

36103
09:42:54,820 --> 09:42:55,760
the happiest creature

36104
09:42:55,760 --> 09:42:56,960
in the world.

36105
09:42:57,020 --> 09:42:58,220
Tis too much,

36106
09:42:58,260 --> 09:42:59,300
she added, By

36107
09:42:59,300 --> 09:43:00,440
far too much.

36108
09:43:00,440 --> 09:43:01,640
I do not deserve it.

36109
09:43:02,320 --> 09:43:03,440
Why Is everybody

36110
09:43:03,440 --> 09:43:04,640
not as happy?

36111
09:43:05,000 --> 09:43:05,600
Elizabeth's

36112
09:43:05,600 --> 09:43:06,480
congratulations

36113
09:43:06,480 --> 09:43:06,860
were given

36114
09:43:06,860 --> 09:43:07,820
with a sincerity,

36115
09:43:07,820 --> 09:43:09,020
a warmth, a delight

36116
09:43:09,140 --> 09:43:09,960
which words could

36117
09:43:09,960 --> 09:43:11,160
but poorly express.

36118
09:43:11,480 --> 09:43:12,680
Every sentence of

36119
09:43:12,980 --> 09:43:13,700
was a fresh source

36120
09:43:13,700 --> 09:43:14,900
of happiness to Jane.

36121
09:43:15,080 --> 09:43:15,720
But she would not.

36122
09:43:15,720 --> 09:43:16,320
Allow herself

36123
09:43:16,320 --> 09:43:17,480
to stay with her sister

36124
09:43:17,480 --> 09:43:18,000
or say

36125
09:43:18,000 --> 09:43:18,560
half that

36126
09:43:18,560 --> 09:43:19,340
remained to be said

36127
09:43:19,340 --> 09:43:20,540
for the present.

36128
09:43:20,600 --> 09:43:21,740
I must go instantly

36129
09:43:21,740 --> 09:43:23,160
to my Mother, she cried.

36130
09:43:23,420 --> 09:43:23,760
I would

36131
09:43:23,760 --> 09:43:24,320
not on any

36132
09:43:24,320 --> 09:43:25,140
account trifle

36133
09:43:25,140 --> 09:43:25,340
with her

36134
09:43:25,340 --> 09:43:26,540
affectionate solicitude

36135
09:43:26,720 --> 09:43:27,660
or allow her to hear

36136
09:43:27,660 --> 09:43:28,880
from anyone but myself.

36137
09:43:29,240 --> 09:43:29,720
He has gone

36138
09:43:29,720 --> 09:43:30,920
to my father already.

36139
09:43:31,360 --> 09:43:32,320
Oh, Lizzie

36140
09:43:32,320 --> 09:43:32,900
To know that

36141
09:43:32,900 --> 09:43:33,780
what I have to relate to

36142
09:43:33,780 --> 09:43:34,760
will give such pleasure

36143
09:43:34,760 --> 09:43:36,020
to all my dear family.

36144
09:43:36,380 --> 09:43:37,580
How shall I bear so much

36145
09:43:37,580 --> 09:43:38,780
happiness?

36146
09:43:38,840 --> 09:43:39,660
She then hastened

36147
09:43:39,660 --> 09:43:40,640
away to her mother,

36148
09:43:40,640 --> 09:43:41,360
who had purposely

36149
09:43:41,360 --> 09:43:42,560
broken up card party

36150
09:43:42,680 --> 09:43:43,820
and was sitting upstairs

36151
09:43:43,820 --> 09:43:45,600
with Kitty Elizabeth,

36152
09:43:45,600 --> 09:43:46,800
who was left by herself.

36153
09:43:47,000 --> 09:43:47,960
Now smiled at

36154
09:43:47,960 --> 09:43:49,280
the rapidity and ease

36155
09:43:49,280 --> 09:43:49,760
with which

36156
09:43:49,760 --> 09:43:50,400
such an affair

36157
09:43:50,400 --> 09:43:51,600
was finally settled.

36158
09:43:51,600 --> 09:43:52,280
That had given them

36159
09:43:52,280 --> 09:43:52,680
so many

36160
09:43:52,680 --> 09:43:53,580
previous months of.

36161
09:43:53,580 --> 09:43:54,360
Suspense and.

36162
09:43:54,360 --> 09:43:55,560
Vexation.

36163
09:43:55,860 --> 09:43:57,260
And this said

36164
09:43:57,260 --> 09:43:58,700
She is the end

36165
09:43:58,700 --> 09:43:59,720
of all his friends,

36166
09:43:59,720 --> 09:44:01,220
anxious circumspection

36167
09:44:01,540 --> 09:44:02,680
of all his sisters

36168
09:44:02,680 --> 09:44:03,360
falsehood

36169
09:44:03,360 --> 09:44:04,540
and contrivance.

36170
09:44:04,540 --> 09:44:06,020
The happiest, wisest,

36171
09:44:06,020 --> 09:44:07,440
most reasonable end.

36172
09:44:08,240 --> 09:44:09,000
In a few minutes,

36173
09:44:09,000 --> 09:44:09,600
she was joined

36174
09:44:09,600 --> 09:44:10,400
by Bingley,

36175
09:44:10,400 --> 09:44:11,100
whose conference

36176
09:44:11,100 --> 09:44:11,300
with her

36177
09:44:11,300 --> 09:44:12,420
father had been short

36178
09:44:12,420 --> 09:44:13,620
and to the purpose.

36179
09:44:14,000 --> 09:44:15,200
Where is your sister?

36180
09:44:15,200 --> 09:44:16,100
Said he hastily,

36181
09:44:16,100 --> 09:44:17,300
as he opened the door.

36182
09:44:17,820 --> 09:44:19,160
With my mother upstairs.

36183
09:44:19,460 --> 09:44:20,060
She would be down

36184
09:44:20,060 --> 09:44:21,260
in a moment, I daresay.

36185
09:44:21,900 --> 09:44:23,100
He then shut the door

36186
09:44:23,220 --> 09:44:23,860
and coming up

36187
09:44:23,860 --> 09:44:24,600
to her claimed

36188
09:44:24,600 --> 09:44:25,340
the good wishes

36189
09:44:25,340 --> 09:44:26,000
and affection

36190
09:44:26,000 --> 09:44:27,020
of a sister.

36191
09:44:27,020 --> 09:44:28,080
Elizabeth honestly

36192
09:44:28,080 --> 09:44:28,620
and heartily

36193
09:44:28,620 --> 09:44:29,580
expressed her delight

36194
09:44:29,580 --> 09:44:30,300
in the prospect

36195
09:44:30,300 --> 09:44:31,500
of their relationship.

36196
09:44:31,640 --> 09:44:32,400
They shook hands

36197
09:44:32,400 --> 09:44:33,660
with great cordiality

36198
09:44:33,900 --> 09:44:35,000
and then till her sister

36199
09:44:35,000 --> 09:44:35,820
came down,

36200
09:44:35,820 --> 09:44:36,900
she had to listen to all

36201
09:44:36,900 --> 09:44:37,440
he had to say

36202
09:44:37,440 --> 09:44:38,500
of his own happiness

36203
09:44:38,500 --> 09:44:39,260
and of Jane's

36204
09:44:39,260 --> 09:44:40,220
perfections.

36205
09:44:40,220 --> 09:44:41,180
And in spite of his

36206
09:44:41,180 --> 09:44:42,120
being a lover.

36207
09:44:42,120 --> 09:44:42,660
Elizabeth

36208
09:44:42,660 --> 09:44:43,400
really believed

36209
09:44:43,400 --> 09:44:44,600
all his expectations

36210
09:44:44,600 --> 09:44:45,200
of Felicity

36211
09:44:45,200 --> 09:44:45,440
to be

36212
09:44:45,440 --> 09:44:46,640
rationally founded.

36213
09:44:46,720 --> 09:44:47,160
Because.

36214
09:44:47,160 --> 09:44:48,040
They had four basis,

36215
09:44:48,040 --> 09:44:48,720
the excellent

36216
09:44:48,720 --> 09:44:50,240
understanding and super

36217
09:44:50,240 --> 09:44:50,720
excellent

36218
09:44:50,720 --> 09:44:51,920
disposition of Jane,

36219
09:44:52,040 --> 09:44:53,420
and a general similarity

36220
09:44:53,420 --> 09:44:54,560
of feeling and taste

36221
09:44:54,560 --> 09:44:55,920
between her and himself.

36222
09:44:56,240 --> 09:44:57,180
It was an evening

36223
09:44:57,180 --> 09:44:57,960
of no common

36224
09:44:57,960 --> 09:44:59,160
delight to them all

36225
09:44:59,160 --> 09:45:00,300
the satisfaction of Mr.

36226
09:45:00,300 --> 09:45:01,040
Bennett's Mind

36227
09:45:01,040 --> 09:45:01,640
gave a glow

36228
09:45:01,640 --> 09:45:02,900
of such sweet animation

36229
09:45:02,900 --> 09:45:04,220
to her face as made her

36230
09:45:04,220 --> 09:45:04,880
look handsomer

36231
09:45:04,880 --> 09:45:05,820
than ever.

36232
09:45:05,820 --> 09:45:06,780
Kitty Simper

36233
09:45:06,780 --> 09:45:08,060
and smiled and hoped her

36234
09:45:08,060 --> 09:45:09,260
turn was coming soon.

36235
09:45:09,540 --> 09:45:09,920
Mrs.

36236
09:45:09,920 --> 09:45:10,620
Bennett could

36237
09:45:10,620 --> 09:45:11,300
give her consent

36238
09:45:11,300 --> 09:45:11,840
or speaker

36239
09:45:11,840 --> 09:45:12,900
approbation in terms

36240
09:45:12,900 --> 09:45:13,460
warm enough

36241
09:45:13,460 --> 09:45:14,660
to satisfy her feelings,

36242
09:45:14,900 --> 09:45:15,500
though she talks

36243
09:45:15,500 --> 09:45:15,920
to Bingley

36244
09:45:15,920 --> 09:45:16,720
of nothing else

36245
09:45:16,720 --> 09:45:17,820
for half an hour,

36246
09:45:17,820 --> 09:45:18,500
and when Mr.

36247
09:45:18,500 --> 09:45:19,160
Bennett joined him

36248
09:45:19,160 --> 09:45:19,860
at supper.

36249
09:45:19,860 --> 09:45:20,600
His voice.

36250
09:45:20,600 --> 09:45:21,720
Manner plainly showed

36251
09:45:21,720 --> 09:45:23,040
how really happy he was.

36252
09:45:23,600 --> 09:45:24,360
Not a word,

36253
09:45:24,360 --> 09:45:24,680
however,

36254
09:45:24,680 --> 09:45:25,460
passed his lips

36255
09:45:25,460 --> 09:45:26,480
in allusion to it,

36256
09:45:26,480 --> 09:45:27,260
till their visitor

36257
09:45:27,260 --> 09:45:27,820
took his leave

36258
09:45:27,820 --> 09:45:28,720
for the night.

36259
09:45:28,720 --> 09:45:29,280
But as soon as

36260
09:45:29,280 --> 09:45:29,860
he was gone,

36261
09:45:29,860 --> 09:45:30,260
he turned to

36262
09:45:30,260 --> 09:45:31,460
his daughter and said.

36263
09:45:31,720 --> 09:45:32,180
Jane,

36264
09:45:32,180 --> 09:45:33,440
I congratulate you.

36265
09:45:33,480 --> 09:45:34,940
You will be a very happy

36266
09:45:34,940 --> 09:45:35,660
woman.

36267
09:45:35,660 --> 09:45:36,480
Jane went to him,

36268
09:45:36,480 --> 09:45:37,640
instantly, kissed him,

36269
09:45:37,640 --> 09:45:38,360
and thanked him

36270
09:45:38,360 --> 09:45:39,560
for his goodness.

36271
09:45:39,740 --> 09:45:40,940
You a good girl?

36272
09:45:41,060 --> 09:45:41,900
He replied.

36273
09:45:41,900 --> 09:45:42,420
And I have

36274
09:45:42,420 --> 09:45:43,220
great pleasure

36275
09:45:43,220 --> 09:45:43,700
in thinking

36276
09:45:43,700 --> 09:45:44,220
you will be so

36277
09:45:44,220 --> 09:45:45,420
happily settled.

36278
09:45:45,600 --> 09:45:46,400
I have not a doubt

36279
09:45:46,400 --> 09:45:46,860
of your doing

36280
09:45:46,860 --> 09:45:48,060
very well together.

36281
09:45:48,120 --> 09:45:49,000
Your tempers are by

36282
09:45:49,000 --> 09:45:50,220
no means unlike

36283
09:45:50,440 --> 09:45:50,840
who you are,

36284
09:45:50,840 --> 09:45:51,200
each of you

36285
09:45:51,200 --> 09:45:51,960
so complying

36286
09:45:51,960 --> 09:45:52,400
that nothing

36287
09:45:52,400 --> 09:45:53,600
will be ever resolved on

36288
09:45:53,820 --> 09:45:54,560
so easy

36289
09:45:54,560 --> 09:45:55,440
that every servant

36290
09:45:55,440 --> 09:45:56,240
will cheat you

36291
09:45:56,240 --> 09:45:57,300
and so generous that

36292
09:45:57,300 --> 09:45:57,900
you will always

36293
09:45:57,900 --> 09:45:59,100
exceed your income.

36294
09:45:59,780 --> 09:46:00,480
I hope not.

36295
09:46:00,480 --> 09:46:01,920
So imprudence

36296
09:46:01,920 --> 09:46:02,680
or thoughtlessness

36297
09:46:02,680 --> 09:46:03,020
in money

36298
09:46:03,020 --> 09:46:03,360
matters

36299
09:46:03,360 --> 09:46:04,280
would be unpardonable

36300
09:46:04,280 --> 09:46:05,400
in me.

36301
09:46:05,400 --> 09:46:06,960
Exceed that income.

36302
09:46:07,180 --> 09:46:08,100
My dear Mr.

36303
09:46:08,100 --> 09:46:08,960
Bennett.

36304
09:46:08,960 --> 09:46:10,160
Cried his wife.

36305
09:46:10,160 --> 09:46:11,360
What are you talking of?

36306
09:46:11,940 --> 09:46:12,260
Why?

36307
09:46:12,260 --> 09:46:13,320
He has four

36308
09:46:13,320 --> 09:46:14,720
or 5000 a year

36309
09:46:14,720 --> 09:46:16,080
and very likely more.

36310
09:46:16,700 --> 09:46:17,360
Than addressing

36311
09:46:17,360 --> 09:46:18,260
her daughter.

36312
09:46:18,260 --> 09:46:18,560
How?

36313
09:46:18,560 --> 09:46:19,700
My dear, dear Jane,

36314
09:46:19,700 --> 09:46:20,900
I am so happy.

36315
09:46:20,940 --> 09:46:21,420
I am sure

36316
09:46:21,420 --> 09:46:21,920
I shan't get a

36317
09:46:21,920 --> 09:46:23,120
wink of sleep all night.

36318
09:46:23,240 --> 09:46:24,560
I knew how it would be.

36319
09:46:24,680 --> 09:46:25,540
I always said

36320
09:46:25,540 --> 09:46:26,860
it must be so at last.

36321
09:46:27,040 --> 09:46:27,660
I was sure

36322
09:46:27,660 --> 09:46:28,860
you could not be so

36323
09:46:28,860 --> 09:46:29,780
for nothing.

36324
09:46:29,780 --> 09:46:30,540
I remember

36325
09:46:30,540 --> 09:46:31,180
as soon as ever

36326
09:46:31,180 --> 09:46:31,700
I saw him

36327
09:46:31,700 --> 09:46:32,360
when he first came

36328
09:46:32,360 --> 09:46:32,960
into Hertfordshire

36329
09:46:32,960 --> 09:46:33,740
last year,

36330
09:46:33,740 --> 09:46:34,800
I thought how likely

36331
09:46:34,800 --> 09:46:35,300
it was that

36332
09:46:35,300 --> 09:46:35,580
you should

36333
09:46:35,580 --> 09:46:36,660
come together.

36334
09:46:36,660 --> 09:46:37,440
Oh, he is the

36335
09:46:37,440 --> 09:46:38,540
handsomest young

36336
09:46:38,540 --> 09:46:39,740
that ever was seen.

36337
09:46:40,440 --> 09:46:41,720
Wickham, Lydia.

36338
09:46:41,760 --> 09:46:42,300
Were all.

36339
09:46:42,300 --> 09:46:43,100
Forgotten.

36340
09:46:43,100 --> 09:46:43,720
Jane was

36341
09:46:43,720 --> 09:46:44,820
beyond competition.

36342
09:46:44,820 --> 09:46:46,020
Her favorite child.

36343
09:46:46,220 --> 09:46:46,940
At that moment,

36344
09:46:46,940 --> 09:46:48,140
she cared for no other.

36345
09:46:48,480 --> 09:46:49,360
Her younger sisters

36346
09:46:49,360 --> 09:46:49,880
soon began

36347
09:46:49,880 --> 09:46:50,660
to make interest

36348
09:46:50,660 --> 09:46:51,000
with her

36349
09:46:51,000 --> 09:46:51,620
for objects

36350
09:46:51,620 --> 09:46:52,180
of happiness,

36351
09:46:52,180 --> 09:46:52,460
which she

36352
09:46:52,460 --> 09:46:53,660
might in future be able

36353
09:46:53,660 --> 09:46:54,860
to dispense.

36354
09:46:55,140 --> 09:46:56,000
Mary petitioned

36355
09:46:56,000 --> 09:46:56,500
for the use

36356
09:46:56,500 --> 09:46:57,260
of the library

36357
09:46:57,260 --> 09:46:58,180
at Netherfield,

36358
09:46:58,180 --> 09:46:58,700
and Kitty

36359
09:46:58,700 --> 09:46:59,540
begged very hard

36360
09:46:59,540 --> 09:47:00,620
for a few balls there

36361
09:47:00,620 --> 09:47:01,820
every winter.

36362
09:47:02,220 --> 09:47:02,680
Bingley

36363
09:47:02,680 --> 09:47:03,500
from this time was,

36364
09:47:03,500 --> 09:47:03,900
of course, a

36365
09:47:03,900 --> 09:47:04,980
daily visitor at Long.

36366
09:47:04,980 --> 09:47:05,460
Bourne.

36367
09:47:05,460 --> 09:47:06,600
Coming frequently before

36368
09:47:06,600 --> 09:47:07,800
breakfast and always

36369
09:47:08,000 --> 09:47:09,140
till after supper.

36370
09:47:09,140 --> 09:47:09,960
Unless when

36371
09:47:09,960 --> 09:47:11,180
some barbarous neighbor

36372
09:47:11,180 --> 09:47:11,960
who could not be enough

36373
09:47:11,960 --> 09:47:13,260
detested, had given him

36374
09:47:13,260 --> 09:47:14,240
an invitation to dinner,

36375
09:47:14,240 --> 09:47:14,720
which he thought

36376
09:47:14,720 --> 09:47:15,540
himself obliged

36377
09:47:15,540 --> 09:47:16,160
to accept.

36378
09:47:17,120 --> 09:47:17,840
Elizabeth Had

36379
09:47:17,840 --> 09:47:18,780
now but little time

36380
09:47:18,780 --> 09:47:19,520
for conversation

36381
09:47:19,520 --> 09:47:20,400
with her sister.

36382
09:47:20,400 --> 09:47:20,760
For while

36383
09:47:20,760 --> 09:47:21,500
he was present,

36384
09:47:21,500 --> 09:47:22,580
Jane had no attention

36385
09:47:22,580 --> 09:47:23,180
to bestow on

36386
09:47:23,180 --> 09:47:24,180
anyone else.

36387
09:47:24,180 --> 09:47:25,040
But she found herself

36388
09:47:25,040 --> 09:47:26,060
considerably useful.

36389
09:47:26,060 --> 09:47:26,720
To both of them

36390
09:47:26,720 --> 09:47:27,420
in those hours

36391
09:47:27,420 --> 09:47:28,140
of separation

36392
09:47:28,140 --> 09:47:28,520
that must

36393
09:47:28,520 --> 09:47:29,720
sometimes occur

36394
09:47:29,940 --> 09:47:31,220
in the absence of Jane.

36395
09:47:31,400 --> 09:47:32,040
He always

36396
09:47:32,040 --> 09:47:32,780
attached himself

36397
09:47:32,780 --> 09:47:33,660
to Elizabeth

36398
09:47:33,660 --> 09:47:34,260
for the pleasure

36399
09:47:34,260 --> 09:47:35,400
of talking with her.

36400
09:47:35,400 --> 09:47:36,040
And when Bingley

36401
09:47:36,040 --> 09:47:36,780
was gone.

36402
09:47:36,780 --> 09:47:37,140
Jane.

36403
09:47:37,140 --> 09:47:37,680
Constantly

36404
09:47:37,680 --> 09:47:38,280
sought the same

36405
09:47:38,280 --> 09:47:39,480
means of relief.

36406
09:47:40,040 --> 09:47:40,760
He has made me

36407
09:47:40,760 --> 09:47:41,960
so happy,

36408
09:47:42,040 --> 09:47:43,260
said she one evening

36409
09:47:43,580 --> 09:47:44,160
by telling me

36410
09:47:44,160 --> 09:47:44,480
that he was

36411
09:47:44,480 --> 09:47:45,420
totally ignorant

36412
09:47:45,420 --> 09:47:46,400
of my being in town.

36413
09:47:46,400 --> 09:47:47,300
Last spring.

36414
09:47:47,300 --> 09:47:48,260
I had not believed it

36415
09:47:48,260 --> 09:47:49,460
possible.

36416
09:47:49,540 --> 09:47:50,840
I suspected as much,

36417
09:47:51,080 --> 09:47:52,080
said Elizabeth.

36418
09:47:52,080 --> 09:47:52,920
But how do you account

36419
09:47:52,920 --> 09:47:53,680
for it?

36420
09:47:53,680 --> 09:47:54,420
It must have been

36421
09:47:54,420 --> 09:47:55,620
his sister's doing.

36422
09:47:55,720 --> 09:47:56,480
They were certainly

36423
09:47:56,480 --> 09:47:57,260
no friends.

36424
09:47:57,260 --> 09:47:57,900
His acquaintance

36425
09:47:57,900 --> 09:47:58,520
with me,

36426
09:47:58,520 --> 09:47:59,220
which I cannot

36427
09:47:59,220 --> 09:48:00,020
wonder at,

36428
09:48:00,020 --> 09:48:00,620
since he might

36429
09:48:00,620 --> 09:48:01,100
have chosen

36430
09:48:01,100 --> 09:48:01,500
so much

36431
09:48:01,500 --> 09:48:02,540
more advantageously

36432
09:48:02,540 --> 09:48:03,740
in many respects.

36433
09:48:03,780 --> 09:48:04,680
But when they see,

36434
09:48:04,680 --> 09:48:05,280
as I trust.

36435
09:48:05,280 --> 09:48:05,820
They will,

36436
09:48:05,820 --> 09:48:06,440
that the brother is.

36437
09:48:06,440 --> 09:48:07,440
Happy with me.

36438
09:48:07,440 --> 09:48:07,680
They will

36439
09:48:07,680 --> 09:48:08,880
learn to be contented

36440
09:48:08,900 --> 09:48:09,660
and we shall be

36441
09:48:09,660 --> 09:48:10,860
on good terms again.

36442
09:48:10,940 --> 09:48:11,820
Though we can never be

36443
09:48:11,820 --> 09:48:12,040
what we.

36444
09:48:12,040 --> 09:48:13,180
Once were to each other.

36445
09:48:14,160 --> 09:48:15,020
That is the most

36446
09:48:15,020 --> 09:48:16,460
unforgiving speech,

36447
09:48:16,640 --> 09:48:17,580
said Elizabeth

36448
09:48:17,580 --> 09:48:18,540
that I ever heard

36449
09:48:18,540 --> 09:48:19,500
you utter.

36450
09:48:19,500 --> 09:48:20,660
Good girl.

36451
09:48:20,660 --> 09:48:22,000
It would vex me indeed,

36452
09:48:22,000 --> 09:48:22,680
to see you again.

36453
09:48:22,680 --> 09:48:23,480
The dupe of miss

36454
09:48:23,480 --> 09:48:24,480
being these pretended

36455
09:48:24,480 --> 09:48:25,680
regard.

36456
09:48:25,920 --> 09:48:26,720
Would you believe it,

36457
09:48:26,720 --> 09:48:27,320
Lizzie

36458
09:48:27,320 --> 09:48:27,680
That when you

36459
09:48:27,680 --> 09:48:28,280
went to town

36460
09:48:28,280 --> 09:48:29,360
last November,

36461
09:48:29,360 --> 09:48:30,560
he really loved me

36462
09:48:30,680 --> 09:48:31,280
and nothing

36463
09:48:31,280 --> 09:48:32,040
but a dissuasion

36464
09:48:32,040 --> 09:48:33,300
of my being indifferent

36465
09:48:33,300 --> 09:48:34,000
would have prevented

36466
09:48:34,000 --> 09:48:35,220
is coming down again.

36467
09:48:35,840 --> 09:48:37,040
He made a little,

36468
09:48:37,100 --> 09:48:38,480
to be sure, but it is.

36469
09:48:38,480 --> 09:48:39,140
To the credit

36470
09:48:39,140 --> 09:48:40,340
of his modesty.

36471
09:48:40,800 --> 09:48:41,660
This naturally

36472
09:48:41,660 --> 09:48:42,820
introduced a panegyric

36473
09:48:42,820 --> 09:48:43,360
from Jane

36474
09:48:43,360 --> 09:48:44,360
on his diffidence

36475
09:48:44,360 --> 09:48:45,220
and the little value

36476
09:48:45,220 --> 09:48:46,000
he put on his own

36477
09:48:46,000 --> 09:48:47,220
good qualities.

36478
09:48:47,220 --> 09:48:48,260
Elizabeth was pleased

36479
09:48:48,260 --> 09:48:48,740
to find that

36480
09:48:48,740 --> 09:48:49,540
he had not betrayed

36481
09:48:49,540 --> 09:48:50,280
the interference

36482
09:48:50,280 --> 09:48:51,320
of his friend.

36483
09:48:51,320 --> 09:48:51,680
For, though,

36484
09:48:51,680 --> 09:48:52,260
Jane had the

36485
09:48:52,260 --> 09:48:53,060
most generous

36486
09:48:53,060 --> 09:48:53,580
and forgiving

36487
09:48:53,580 --> 09:48:54,680
heart in the world.

36488
09:48:54,680 --> 09:48:55,280
She knew it was

36489
09:48:55,280 --> 09:48:56,040
a circumstance

36490
09:48:56,040 --> 09:48:56,900
which must prejudiced

36491
09:48:56,900 --> 09:48:58,100
her against him.

36492
09:48:58,440 --> 09:48:59,600
I am certainly the most

36493
09:48:59,600 --> 09:49:00,440
fortunate creature

36494
09:49:00,440 --> 09:49:01,640
that ever existed,

36495
09:49:01,880 --> 09:49:03,000
cried Jane.

36496
09:49:03,000 --> 09:49:04,000
How, Lizzie?

36497
09:49:04,000 --> 09:49:04,920
Why am I thus

36498
09:49:04,920 --> 09:49:06,120
singled from my family

36499
09:49:06,120 --> 09:49:07,320
and blessed above all?

36500
09:49:07,680 --> 09:49:08,160
If I could

36501
09:49:08,160 --> 09:49:09,380
but see you as happy.

36502
09:49:09,600 --> 09:49:10,320
If there were

36503
09:49:10,320 --> 09:49:10,880
but such another

36504
09:49:10,880 --> 09:49:12,080
man for you.

36505
09:49:12,260 --> 09:49:12,800
If you were to

36506
09:49:12,800 --> 09:49:14,120
give me 40 such men.

36507
09:49:14,120 --> 09:49:14,400
I could.

36508
09:49:14,400 --> 09:49:15,420
Never be so happy as.

36509
09:49:15,420 --> 09:49:16,620
You till I

36510
09:49:16,620 --> 09:49:17,820
have your disposition.

36511
09:49:17,960 --> 09:49:19,080
Your goodness.

36512
09:49:19,080 --> 09:49:19,760
I can never

36513
09:49:19,760 --> 09:49:20,960
have your happiness.

36514
09:49:21,300 --> 09:49:22,460
No, no.

36515
09:49:22,460 --> 09:49:23,760
Let me shift for myself.

36516
09:49:24,200 --> 09:49:24,920
And perhaps

36517
09:49:24,920 --> 09:49:25,540
if I have very

36518
09:49:25,540 --> 09:49:26,060
good luck,

36519
09:49:26,060 --> 09:49:27,440
I meet with another Mr.

36520
09:49:27,440 --> 09:49:28,640
Collins in time.

36521
09:49:29,320 --> 09:49:30,560
The situation of affairs

36522
09:49:30,560 --> 09:49:30,980
in the long

36523
09:49:30,980 --> 09:49:31,620
born family

36524
09:49:31,620 --> 09:49:32,420
could not be long

36525
09:49:32,420 --> 09:49:33,260
a secret.

36526
09:49:33,260 --> 09:49:33,680
Mrs.

36527
09:49:33,680 --> 09:49:34,680
Bennet was privileged

36528
09:49:34,680 --> 09:49:35,660
to whisper it to Mrs.

36529
09:49:35,660 --> 09:49:36,320
Phillips,

36530
09:49:36,320 --> 09:49:37,080
and she ventured

36531
09:49:37,080 --> 09:49:38,040
without any permission

36532
09:49:38,040 --> 09:49:38,760
to do the same

36533
09:49:38,760 --> 09:49:39,800
by all her neighbors

36534
09:49:39,800 --> 09:49:40,920
in Maritain.

36535
09:49:40,920 --> 09:49:41,460
The bayonets

36536
09:49:41,460 --> 09:49:42,040
were speedily

36537
09:49:42,040 --> 09:49:42,720
pronounced to be

36538
09:49:42,720 --> 09:49:43,360
the luckiest

36539
09:49:43,360 --> 09:49:44,580
family in the world,

36540
09:49:44,600 --> 09:49:44,820
though

36541
09:49:44,820 --> 09:49:46,160
only a few weeks Before,

36542
09:49:46,160 --> 09:49:46,800
when Lydia had

36543
09:49:46,800 --> 09:49:47,840
first run away.

36544
09:49:47,840 --> 09:49:48,360
They had been.

36545
09:49:48,360 --> 09:49:49,160
Generally proved

36546
09:49:49,160 --> 09:49:50,100
to be marked out

36547
09:49:50,100 --> 09:49:51,000
for misfortune.

36548
09:49:52,720 --> 09:49:54,000
Chapter 56.

36549
09:49:55,260 --> 09:49:56,040
One.

36550
09:49:56,040 --> 09:49:56,640
About a week

36551
09:49:56,640 --> 09:49:57,300
after Bailey's

36552
09:49:57,300 --> 09:49:58,340
engagement with Jane

36553
09:49:58,340 --> 09:49:59,940
had been formed, as he

36554
09:49:59,940 --> 09:50:00,600
and the females

36555
09:50:00,600 --> 09:50:01,220
of the family

36556
09:50:01,220 --> 09:50:02,040
were sitting together

36557
09:50:02,040 --> 09:50:03,080
in the dining room,

36558
09:50:03,080 --> 09:50:03,740
their attention

36559
09:50:03,740 --> 09:50:04,540
was suddenly drawn

36560
09:50:04,540 --> 09:50:05,240
to the window

36561
09:50:05,240 --> 09:50:05,480
by the

36562
09:50:05,480 --> 09:50:06,680
sound of a carriage,

36563
09:50:06,740 --> 09:50:07,540
and they perceived

36564
09:50:07,540 --> 09:50:07,980
a shares

36565
09:50:07,980 --> 09:50:08,460
and for

36566
09:50:08,460 --> 09:50:09,660
driving up the lawn.

36567
09:50:09,920 --> 09:50:10,800
It was too early

36568
09:50:10,800 --> 09:50:11,280
in the morning

36569
09:50:11,280 --> 09:50:12,140
for visitors.

36570
09:50:12,140 --> 09:50:12,980
And besides,

36571
09:50:12,980 --> 09:50:13,760
the equipage

36572
09:50:13,760 --> 09:50:14,840
did not answer to that

36573
09:50:14,840 --> 09:50:15,300
of any of

36574
09:50:15,300 --> 09:50:16,320
their neighbors.

36575
09:50:16,320 --> 09:50:16,920
The horses

36576
09:50:16,920 --> 09:50:17,680
were purchased

36577
09:50:17,680 --> 09:50:18,900
and neither the carriage

36578
09:50:18,900 --> 09:50:19,520
nor the livery

36579
09:50:19,520 --> 09:50:20,100
of the servant

36580
09:50:20,100 --> 09:50:21,080
who preceded it

36581
09:50:21,080 --> 09:50:22,280
were familiar to them.

36582
09:50:22,640 --> 09:50:23,500
As it was certain,

36583
09:50:23,500 --> 09:50:24,040
however, that

36584
09:50:24,040 --> 09:50:25,260
somebody was coming.

36585
09:50:25,360 --> 09:50:26,320
Bingley instantly

36586
09:50:26,320 --> 09:50:26,900
prevailed on

36587
09:50:26,900 --> 09:50:27,480
Miss Spanish

36588
09:50:27,480 --> 09:50:28,640
to avoid the confinement

36589
09:50:28,640 --> 09:50:29,840
of such an intrusion

36590
09:50:29,840 --> 09:50:30,820
and walk away with him

36591
09:50:30,820 --> 09:50:32,040
into the shrubbery.

36592
09:50:32,100 --> 09:50:33,300
They both set off

36593
09:50:33,360 --> 09:50:34,320
and the conjectures

36594
09:50:34,320 --> 09:50:34,920
of the remaining

36595
09:50:34,920 --> 09:50:35,960
three continued.

36596
09:50:35,960 --> 09:50:36,260
Though.

36597
09:50:36,260 --> 09:50:37,460
With little satisfaction

36598
09:50:37,700 --> 09:50:38,320
till the door

36599
09:50:38,320 --> 09:50:39,120
was thrown open

36600
09:50:39,120 --> 09:50:39,500
and their

36601
09:50:39,500 --> 09:50:40,700
visitor entered.

36602
09:50:40,760 --> 09:50:41,480
It was Lady

36603
09:50:41,480 --> 09:50:42,680
Catherine de Berg.

36604
09:50:43,360 --> 09:50:44,320
They were of course

36605
09:50:44,320 --> 09:50:45,080
all intending

36606
09:50:45,080 --> 09:50:46,140
to be surprised,

36607
09:50:46,140 --> 09:50:47,220
but their astonishment

36608
09:50:47,220 --> 09:50:47,900
was beyond

36609
09:50:47,900 --> 09:50:49,100
their expectation.

36610
09:50:49,320 --> 09:50:50,500
And on the part of Mrs.

36611
09:50:50,500 --> 09:50:51,000
Bennet and.

36612
09:50:51,000 --> 09:50:51,860
Kitty, though.

36613
09:50:51,860 --> 09:50:52,180
She was

36614
09:50:52,180 --> 09:50:52,980
perfectly unknown

36615
09:50:52,980 --> 09:50:54,800
to them, even to what

36616
09:50:54,820 --> 09:50:56,040
Elizabeth felt,

36617
09:50:56,400 --> 09:50:57,320
she entered the room

36618
09:50:57,320 --> 09:50:57,820
with an error

36619
09:50:57,820 --> 09:50:58,180
more than

36620
09:50:58,180 --> 09:50:59,460
usually ungracious.

36621
09:50:59,700 --> 09:51:00,080
Made.

36622
09:51:00,080 --> 09:51:00,920
No other reply

36623
09:51:00,920 --> 09:51:01,520
to Elizabeth's

36624
09:51:01,520 --> 09:51:02,240
salutation,

36625
09:51:02,240 --> 09:51:02,840
then a slight

36626
09:51:02,840 --> 09:51:04,040
inclination of the head

36627
09:51:04,320 --> 09:51:05,180
and sat down

36628
09:51:05,180 --> 09:51:06,380
without saying a word.

36629
09:51:06,840 --> 09:51:07,560
Elizabeth had

36630
09:51:07,560 --> 09:51:08,000
mentioned her

36631
09:51:08,000 --> 09:51:08,840
name to her mother

36632
09:51:08,840 --> 09:51:09,080
on her

36633
09:51:09,080 --> 09:51:10,260
Ladyship entrance,

36634
09:51:10,260 --> 09:51:10,440
though

36635
09:51:10,440 --> 09:51:11,060
no request

36636
09:51:11,060 --> 09:51:11,780
of introduction

36637
09:51:11,780 --> 09:51:12,980
had been made.

36638
09:51:13,260 --> 09:51:13,700
Mrs.

36639
09:51:13,700 --> 09:51:14,900
Bennet all amazement,

36640
09:51:15,080 --> 09:51:15,800
though flattered

36641
09:51:15,800 --> 09:51:16,620
by having a guest

36642
09:51:16,620 --> 09:51:17,820
of such high importance,

36643
09:51:17,940 --> 09:51:18,540
received her

36644
09:51:18,540 --> 09:51:18,780
with the

36645
09:51:18,780 --> 09:51:19,980
utmost politeness.

36646
09:51:20,420 --> 09:51:21,200
After sitting for

36647
09:51:21,200 --> 09:51:22,400
a moment in silence,

36648
09:51:22,460 --> 09:51:23,700
she said very stiffly,

36649
09:51:23,880 --> 09:51:25,080
Elizabeth.

36650
09:51:25,160 --> 09:51:26,400
I hope you are well,

36651
09:51:26,400 --> 09:51:27,600
Miss Bennet.

36652
09:51:27,780 --> 09:51:28,620
That lady,

36653
09:51:28,620 --> 09:51:29,400
I suppose,

36654
09:51:29,400 --> 09:51:30,600
is your mother.

36655
09:51:31,220 --> 09:51:32,180
Elizabeth replied

36656
09:51:32,180 --> 09:51:33,060
very concisely

36657
09:51:33,060 --> 09:51:34,260
that she was.

36658
09:51:34,580 --> 09:51:35,540
And that, I.

36659
09:51:35,540 --> 09:51:36,140
Suppose, is

36660
09:51:36,140 --> 09:51:37,340
one of your sisters.

36661
09:51:38,120 --> 09:51:39,320
Yes, madam.

36662
09:51:39,420 --> 09:51:39,980
Said Mrs.

36663
09:51:39,980 --> 09:51:40,860
Bennet, delighted

36664
09:51:40,860 --> 09:51:41,240
to speak

36665
09:51:41,240 --> 09:51:42,440
to Lady Catherine.

36666
09:51:42,560 --> 09:51:43,880
She is my youngest girl,

36667
09:51:43,880 --> 09:51:44,540
but one.

36668
09:51:44,540 --> 09:51:45,500
My youngest of all

36669
09:51:45,500 --> 09:51:46,380
is lately married

36670
09:51:46,380 --> 09:51:47,100
and my eldest

36671
09:51:47,100 --> 09:51:47,600
is somewhere

36672
09:51:47,600 --> 09:51:48,600
about the grounds.

36673
09:51:48,600 --> 09:51:49,040
Walking

36674
09:51:49,040 --> 09:51:49,760
with the young man

36675
09:51:49,760 --> 09:51:50,960
who I believe will soon

36676
09:51:50,960 --> 09:51:51,500
become a part

36677
09:51:51,500 --> 09:51:52,200
of the family.

36678
09:51:53,220 --> 09:51:53,760
You have a

36679
09:51:53,760 --> 09:51:55,800
very small park here.

36680
09:51:56,280 --> 09:51:57,540
Returned Lady Catherine,

36681
09:51:57,540 --> 09:51:58,740
after a short silence.

36682
09:51:59,400 --> 09:52:00,300
It is nothing in

36683
09:52:00,300 --> 09:52:00,960
comparison of

36684
09:52:00,960 --> 09:52:01,880
two things, my lady.

36685
09:52:01,880 --> 09:52:03,080
I daresay, but

36686
09:52:03,080 --> 09:52:03,720
I assure you

36687
09:52:03,720 --> 09:52:04,560
it is much larger

36688
09:52:04,560 --> 09:52:04,860
than Sir

36689
09:52:04,860 --> 09:52:06,060
William Lucas's.

36690
09:52:06,620 --> 09:52:07,400
This must be

36691
09:52:07,400 --> 09:52:08,700
most inconvenient

36692
09:52:08,700 --> 09:52:09,200
sitting room

36693
09:52:09,200 --> 09:52:09,840
for the evening

36694
09:52:09,840 --> 09:52:10,740
and summer.

36695
09:52:10,740 --> 09:52:12,000
The windows are full

36696
09:52:12,000 --> 09:52:13,200
west.

36697
09:52:13,500 --> 09:52:13,860
Mrs.

36698
09:52:13,860 --> 09:52:14,720
Bennett assured her

36699
09:52:14,720 --> 09:52:15,260
that they never

36700
09:52:15,260 --> 09:52:16,460
sat there after dinner

36701
09:52:16,560 --> 09:52:17,760
and then added.

36702
09:52:18,240 --> 09:52:19,380
May I take the liberty

36703
09:52:19,380 --> 09:52:20,520
of asking your Ladyship

36704
09:52:20,520 --> 09:52:21,540
whether you left Mr.

36705
09:52:21,540 --> 09:52:21,980
and Mrs.

36706
09:52:21,980 --> 09:52:23,180
Collins? Well.

36707
09:52:23,480 --> 09:52:25,080
Yes, very well.

36708
09:52:25,340 --> 09:52:26,460
I saw them the night

36709
09:52:26,460 --> 09:52:27,660
before last.

36710
09:52:27,860 --> 09:52:28,640
Elizabeth now

36711
09:52:28,640 --> 09:52:29,340
expected that

36712
09:52:29,340 --> 09:52:29,600
she would

36713
09:52:29,600 --> 09:52:30,320
produce a letter

36714
09:52:30,320 --> 09:52:31,520
for her from Charlotte,

36715
09:52:31,560 --> 09:52:32,180
as it seemed

36716
09:52:32,180 --> 09:52:33,420
the only probable motive

36717
09:52:33,420 --> 09:52:34,620
for her calling.

36718
09:52:34,640 --> 09:52:35,840
But no letter appeared,

36719
09:52:36,020 --> 09:52:36,540
and she was

36720
09:52:36,540 --> 09:52:37,740
completely puzzled.

36721
09:52:38,220 --> 09:52:38,600
Mrs.

36722
09:52:38,600 --> 09:52:38,940
Bennett,

36723
09:52:38,940 --> 09:52:39,920
with great civility,

36724
09:52:39,920 --> 09:52:40,760
begged her ladyship

36725
09:52:40,760 --> 09:52:41,060
to take

36726
09:52:41,060 --> 09:52:42,140
some refreshment.

36727
09:52:42,140 --> 09:52:43,080
But Lady Catherine,

36728
09:52:43,080 --> 09:52:44,180
very resolutely

36729
09:52:44,180 --> 09:52:45,080
and not very

36730
09:52:45,080 --> 09:52:46,520
politely declined

36731
09:52:46,520 --> 09:52:46,820
eating.

36732
09:52:46,820 --> 09:52:47,580
Anything

36733
09:52:47,580 --> 09:52:48,440
and then rising.

36734
09:52:48,440 --> 09:52:49,640
Up, said to Elizabeth.

36735
09:52:50,180 --> 09:52:51,360
Miss Bennett,

36736
09:52:51,360 --> 09:52:52,080
the seem to be

36737
09:52:52,080 --> 09:52:52,700
a pretty ish

36738
09:52:52,700 --> 09:52:53,160
kind of a

36739
09:52:53,160 --> 09:52:54,060
little wilderness

36740
09:52:54,060 --> 09:52:54,620
on one side

36741
09:52:54,620 --> 09:52:55,560
of your lawn.

36742
09:52:55,560 --> 09:52:56,360
I should be glad

36743
09:52:56,360 --> 09:52:57,560
to take a turn in it,

36744
09:52:57,560 --> 09:52:58,640
if you will favor me

36745
09:52:58,640 --> 09:52:59,540
with your company.

36746
09:53:00,500 --> 09:53:01,640
Go, my dear.

36747
09:53:01,640 --> 09:53:02,660
Cried her mother,

36748
09:53:02,660 --> 09:53:03,260
and show her

36749
09:53:03,260 --> 09:53:03,920
ladyship about.

36750
09:53:03,920 --> 09:53:05,040
The various walks.

36751
09:53:05,040 --> 09:53:05,700
I think she will

36752
09:53:05,700 --> 09:53:06,180
be pleased

36753
09:53:06,180 --> 09:53:07,380
with the Hermitage.

36754
09:53:07,820 --> 09:53:09,020
Elizabeth obeyed

36755
09:53:09,120 --> 09:53:09,680
and running

36756
09:53:09,680 --> 09:53:10,500
into her own room

36757
09:53:10,500 --> 09:53:10,760
for her

36758
09:53:10,760 --> 09:53:12,180
parasol, attended her

36759
09:53:12,180 --> 09:53:13,640
noble guest downstairs

36760
09:53:14,060 --> 09:53:14,840
as they passed

36761
09:53:14,840 --> 09:53:15,600
through the hall.

36762
09:53:15,600 --> 09:53:16,400
Lady Catherine

36763
09:53:16,400 --> 09:53:17,160
opened the doors

36764
09:53:17,160 --> 09:53:18,140
into the dining parlor

36765
09:53:18,140 --> 09:53:19,220
and drawing room

36766
09:53:19,220 --> 09:53:20,220
and pronouncing them.

36767
09:53:20,220 --> 09:53:21,420
After a short survey.

36768
09:53:21,440 --> 09:53:22,880
Be decent looking rooms.

36769
09:53:23,100 --> 09:53:25,040
Walked on her carriage,

36770
09:53:25,040 --> 09:53:26,240
remained at the door,

36771
09:53:26,340 --> 09:53:27,420
and Elizabeth saw that

36772
09:53:27,420 --> 09:53:27,900
her waiting

36773
09:53:27,900 --> 09:53:28,980
woman was in it.

36774
09:53:28,980 --> 09:53:29,600
They proceeded

36775
09:53:29,600 --> 09:53:30,480
in silence along

36776
09:53:30,480 --> 09:53:31,340
the gravel walk

36777
09:53:31,340 --> 09:53:32,460
led to the corpse.

36778
09:53:32,460 --> 09:53:33,780
Elizabeth was determined

36779
09:53:33,780 --> 09:53:34,700
to make no effort

36780
09:53:34,700 --> 09:53:35,540
for conversation

36781
09:53:35,540 --> 09:53:36,020
with a woman

36782
09:53:36,020 --> 09:53:36,780
who was now more

36783
09:53:36,780 --> 09:53:37,980
than usually insolent

36784
09:53:37,980 --> 09:53:39,180
and disagreeable.

36785
09:53:39,900 --> 09:53:41,160
How could I ever think.

36786
09:53:41,160 --> 09:53:41,580
Her like a.

36787
09:53:41,580 --> 09:53:42,440
Nephew?

36788
09:53:42,440 --> 09:53:43,640
Said she, as she looked

36789
09:53:43,640 --> 09:53:44,840
in her face.

36790
09:53:45,020 --> 09:53:45,480
As soon.

36791
09:53:45,480 --> 09:53:46,020
As they entered

36792
09:53:46,020 --> 09:53:47,060
the corpse Lady.

36793
09:53:47,060 --> 09:53:47,940
Catherine began

36794
09:53:47,940 --> 09:53:48,900
in the following manner.

36795
09:53:49,860 --> 09:53:50,640
You can be at

36796
09:53:50,640 --> 09:53:52,080
no loss, Miss Bennet,

36797
09:53:52,080 --> 09:53:53,360
to understand the reason

36798
09:53:53,360 --> 09:53:54,560
of my journey hither.

36799
09:53:54,900 --> 09:53:56,100
Your own heart,

36800
09:53:56,160 --> 09:53:57,320
your own conscience

36801
09:53:57,320 --> 09:53:58,560
must tell you why

36802
09:53:58,560 --> 09:53:59,760
I come.

36803
09:54:00,180 --> 09:54:00,980
Elizabeth

36804
09:54:00,980 --> 09:54:01,740
with unaffected

36805
09:54:01,740 --> 09:54:02,940
astonishment.

36806
09:54:03,140 --> 09:54:03,740
Indeed.

36807
09:54:03,740 --> 09:54:04,020
You are

36808
09:54:04,020 --> 09:54:05,220
mistaken, Madame.

36809
09:54:05,220 --> 09:54:06,120
I have not been at

36810
09:54:06,120 --> 09:54:06,600
all able

36811
09:54:06,600 --> 09:54:07,500
to account for the honor

36812
09:54:07,500 --> 09:54:08,700
of seeing you here.

36813
09:54:09,020 --> 09:54:10,220
Miss Bennet

36814
09:54:10,580 --> 09:54:11,720
replied her Ladyship,

36815
09:54:11,720 --> 09:54:12,920
in an angry tone.

36816
09:54:13,020 --> 09:54:14,120
You ought to know

36817
09:54:14,120 --> 09:54:14,940
that I am not to

36818
09:54:14,940 --> 09:54:16,140
be trifled with.

36819
09:54:16,320 --> 09:54:17,700
But however insincere

36820
09:54:17,700 --> 09:54:18,920
you may choose to be,

36821
09:54:18,920 --> 09:54:20,120
you shall not find me.

36822
09:54:21,000 --> 09:54:21,920
My character

36823
09:54:21,920 --> 09:54:23,220
has ever been celebrated

36824
09:54:23,220 --> 09:54:24,180
for its sincerity

36825
09:54:24,180 --> 09:54:25,340
and frankness.

36826
09:54:25,340 --> 09:54:26,240
And in a cause of

36827
09:54:26,240 --> 09:54:27,700
such moment as this,

36828
09:54:27,720 --> 09:54:28,980
I shall certainly not

36829
09:54:28,980 --> 09:54:30,180
depart from it.

36830
09:54:30,380 --> 09:54:31,020
A report

36831
09:54:31,020 --> 09:54:31,640
of a most

36832
09:54:31,640 --> 09:54:32,880
alarming nature

36833
09:54:32,880 --> 09:54:33,360
reached me.

36834
09:54:33,360 --> 09:54:34,560
Two days ago

36835
09:54:34,800 --> 09:54:35,660
I was told that

36836
09:54:35,660 --> 09:54:37,040
not only was your sister

36837
09:54:37,040 --> 09:54:37,500
on the point

36838
09:54:37,500 --> 09:54:38,120
of being most

36839
09:54:38,120 --> 09:54:39,620
advantageously married,

36840
09:54:40,080 --> 09:54:41,180
but that you

36841
09:54:41,180 --> 09:54:42,120
that Miss

36842
09:54:42,120 --> 09:54:43,440
Elizabeth Bennet

36843
09:54:43,740 --> 09:54:45,080
would in all likelihood

36844
09:54:45,080 --> 09:54:46,040
be soon afterwards.

36845
09:54:46,040 --> 09:54:47,540
United to my nephew,

36846
09:54:47,720 --> 09:54:50,040
my own nephew, Mr.

36847
09:54:50,040 --> 09:54:51,240
Darcy.

36848
09:54:51,440 --> 09:54:52,280
Though I know it

36849
09:54:52,280 --> 09:54:53,600
must be a scandalous

36850
09:54:53,600 --> 09:54:54,360
falsehood,

36851
09:54:54,360 --> 09:54:54,600
though

36852
09:54:54,600 --> 09:54:55,860
I would not injure him

36853
09:54:55,860 --> 09:54:56,780
so much as to suppose

36854
09:54:56,780 --> 09:54:57,240
the truth of it

36855
09:54:57,240 --> 09:54:58,200
is possible.

36856
09:54:58,200 --> 09:54:59,460
I instantly resolved

36857
09:54:59,460 --> 09:55:00,180
on setting off

36858
09:55:00,180 --> 09:55:01,340
for this place

36859
09:55:01,340 --> 09:55:02,220
that I might make my

36860
09:55:02,220 --> 09:55:03,540
sentiments known to you

36861
09:55:04,700 --> 09:55:05,720
if you believed it.

36862
09:55:05,720 --> 09:55:07,080
Impossible to be true.

36863
09:55:07,380 --> 09:55:08,580
Said Elizabeth, coloring

36864
09:55:08,580 --> 09:55:09,380
with astonishment

36865
09:55:09,380 --> 09:55:10,580
and disdain.

36866
09:55:10,860 --> 09:55:11,580
I wonder you

36867
09:55:11,580 --> 09:55:12,200
took the trouble

36868
09:55:12,200 --> 09:55:13,400
of coming so far.

36869
09:55:13,620 --> 09:55:14,720
What could Your Ladyship

36870
09:55:14,720 --> 09:55:15,920
propose by it

36871
09:55:16,400 --> 09:55:17,840
at once to insist

36872
09:55:17,840 --> 09:55:18,420
upon having

36873
09:55:18,420 --> 09:55:19,340
such a report

36874
09:55:19,340 --> 09:55:20,100
universally

36875
09:55:20,100 --> 09:55:21,300
contradicted?

36876
09:55:22,040 --> 09:55:22,760
You're coming

36877
09:55:22,760 --> 09:55:23,160
too long,

36878
09:55:23,160 --> 09:55:23,960
borne to see me

36879
09:55:23,960 --> 09:55:25,160
and my family?

36880
09:55:25,160 --> 09:55:26,360
Said Elizabeth coolly.

36881
09:55:26,760 --> 09:55:27,620
Will be rather

36882
09:55:27,620 --> 09:55:28,820
a confirmation of it,

36883
09:55:29,060 --> 09:55:30,020
if indeed such

36884
09:55:30,020 --> 09:55:30,480
a report

36885
09:55:30,480 --> 09:55:31,680
is in existence.

36886
09:55:32,360 --> 09:55:34,200
If do you

36887
09:55:34,200 --> 09:55:35,160
then pretend to be

36888
09:55:35,160 --> 09:55:36,360
ignorant of it?

36889
09:55:36,560 --> 09:55:37,580
Has it not been

36890
09:55:37,580 --> 09:55:38,780
industriously

36891
09:55:39,440 --> 09:55:40,640
by yourselves?

36892
09:55:40,860 --> 09:55:41,780
Do you not know

36893
09:55:41,780 --> 09:55:42,180
that such

36894
09:55:42,180 --> 09:55:42,720
a report

36895
09:55:42,720 --> 09:55:43,920
is spread about?

36896
09:55:44,420 --> 09:55:45,080
I never heard

36897
09:55:45,080 --> 09:55:46,280
that it was.

36898
09:55:46,520 --> 09:55:47,900
And can you likewise.

36899
09:55:47,900 --> 09:55:48,300
Declare.

36900
09:55:48,300 --> 09:55:48,680
That there is

36901
09:55:48,680 --> 09:55:50,060
no foundation for it?

36902
09:55:51,260 --> 09:55:52,200
I do not pretend

36903
09:55:52,200 --> 09:55:52,640
to possess

36904
09:55:52,640 --> 09:55:53,640
equal frankness

36905
09:55:53,640 --> 09:55:54,840
with your Ladyship.

36906
09:55:54,860 --> 09:55:56,280
You may ask questions

36907
09:55:56,280 --> 09:55:57,020
which I shall not

36908
09:55:57,020 --> 09:55:58,220
choose to answer.

36909
09:55:59,040 --> 09:56:00,900
This is not to be borne,

36910
09:56:01,320 --> 09:56:02,100
Miss Bennet.

36911
09:56:02,100 --> 09:56:02,900
I insist on

36912
09:56:02,900 --> 09:56:04,100
being satisfied.

36913
09:56:04,320 --> 09:56:05,280
Has he?

36914
09:56:05,280 --> 09:56:06,420
Has my nephew made

36915
09:56:06,420 --> 09:56:06,920
you an offer

36916
09:56:06,920 --> 09:56:07,460
of marriage?

36917
09:56:08,420 --> 09:56:09,200
Your Ladyship

36918
09:56:09,200 --> 09:56:09,960
has declared it

36919
09:56:09,960 --> 09:56:11,160
to be impossible.

36920
09:56:11,540 --> 09:56:12,920
It ought to be so.

36921
09:56:13,160 --> 09:56:14,220
It must be so.

36922
09:56:14,220 --> 09:56:14,900
While he retains

36923
09:56:14,900 --> 09:56:16,100
the use of his reason.

36924
09:56:16,340 --> 09:56:17,040
But to your

36925
09:56:17,040 --> 09:56:18,540
ought a lawman

36926
09:56:18,540 --> 09:56:19,020
to may,

36927
09:56:19,020 --> 09:56:19,560
in a moment

36928
09:56:19,560 --> 09:56:20,360
of infatuation,

36929
09:56:20,360 --> 09:56:20,760
have made him

36930
09:56:20,760 --> 09:56:21,320
forget what

36931
09:56:21,320 --> 09:56:22,160
he owes to himself

36932
09:56:22,160 --> 09:56:23,360
and to all his family.

36933
09:56:23,460 --> 09:56:24,380
You may have

36934
09:56:24,380 --> 09:56:25,580
drawn him in.

36935
09:56:26,300 --> 09:56:27,360
If I have,

36936
09:56:27,360 --> 09:56:28,440
shall be the last person

36937
09:56:28,440 --> 09:56:29,640
to confess it.

36938
09:56:30,080 --> 09:56:31,280
Miss Bennet,

36939
09:56:31,800 --> 09:56:33,600
do you know who I am?

36940
09:56:34,020 --> 09:56:34,920
I have not

36941
09:56:34,920 --> 09:56:35,660
been accustomed

36942
09:56:35,660 --> 09:56:36,260
to language

36943
09:56:36,260 --> 09:56:37,460
such as this?

36944
09:56:37,500 --> 09:56:38,480
I am almost

36945
09:56:38,480 --> 09:56:39,360
the nearest relation

36946
09:56:39,360 --> 09:56:40,400
he has in the world.

36947
09:56:40,400 --> 09:56:41,480
And I'm entitled to know

36948
09:56:41,480 --> 09:56:42,000
all his

36949
09:56:42,000 --> 09:56:43,200
dearest concerns.

36950
09:56:43,940 --> 09:56:45,480
But you are not entitled

36951
09:56:45,480 --> 09:56:46,560
to know mine.

36952
09:56:46,560 --> 09:56:47,780
Nor Will such behavior

36953
09:56:47,780 --> 09:56:49,020
as this ever induce me

36954
09:56:49,020 --> 09:56:50,220
to be explicit?

36955
09:56:50,220 --> 09:56:51,260
Let me be

36956
09:56:51,260 --> 09:56:52,460
rightly understood.

36957
09:56:53,060 --> 09:56:54,060
This match

36958
09:56:54,060 --> 09:56:54,440
to which

36959
09:56:54,440 --> 09:56:55,820
you have the presumption

36960
09:56:55,820 --> 09:56:56,420
to aspire

36961
09:56:56,420 --> 09:56:57,620
can never take place.

36962
09:56:58,020 --> 09:56:59,420
No, never.

36963
09:56:59,840 --> 09:57:00,360
Mr.

36964
09:57:00,360 --> 09:57:00,980
Darcy is

36965
09:57:00,980 --> 09:57:02,900
engaged to my daughter.

36966
09:57:03,720 --> 09:57:04,260
Now, what

36967
09:57:04,260 --> 09:57:04,940
have you to say?

36968
09:57:06,000 --> 09:57:07,040
Only This.

36969
09:57:07,040 --> 09:57:07,260
That.

36970
09:57:07,260 --> 09:57:07,980
If he is so,

36971
09:57:07,980 --> 09:57:08,820
you can have no reason

36972
09:57:08,820 --> 09:57:09,260
to suppose

36973
09:57:09,260 --> 09:57:09,920
he'll make an offer

36974
09:57:09,920 --> 09:57:11,120
to me.

36975
09:57:11,180 --> 09:57:11,960
Lady Catherine

36976
09:57:11,960 --> 09:57:13,100
hesitated for a moment

36977
09:57:13,100 --> 09:57:14,300
and then replied.

36978
09:57:14,780 --> 09:57:15,500
The engagement

36979
09:57:15,500 --> 09:57:16,140
between them

36980
09:57:16,140 --> 09:57:17,340
of a peculiar kind.

36981
09:57:17,600 --> 09:57:18,540
From their infancy,

36982
09:57:18,540 --> 09:57:19,400
they have been intended

36983
09:57:19,400 --> 09:57:20,420
for each other.

36984
09:57:20,420 --> 09:57:21,420
It was the favorite

36985
09:57:21,420 --> 09:57:22,820
wish of his mother,

36986
09:57:22,820 --> 09:57:24,020
as well as of hers.

36987
09:57:24,200 --> 09:57:25,380
While in their cradles.

36988
09:57:25,380 --> 09:57:26,640
We planned the union.

36989
09:57:27,060 --> 09:57:28,320
And now, with the moment

36990
09:57:28,320 --> 09:57:28,800
when the wishes

36991
09:57:28,800 --> 09:57:29,820
of both sisters

36992
09:57:29,820 --> 09:57:30,560
would be accomplished

36993
09:57:30,560 --> 09:57:31,500
in their marriage,

36994
09:57:31,500 --> 09:57:32,540
to be prevented

36995
09:57:32,540 --> 09:57:33,360
by a young woman

36996
09:57:33,360 --> 09:57:34,040
of inferior,

36997
09:57:34,040 --> 09:57:35,540
but of no importance

36998
09:57:35,540 --> 09:57:36,000
in the world,

36999
09:57:36,000 --> 09:57:36,540
and wholly

37000
09:57:36,540 --> 09:57:37,740
an ally to the family.

37001
09:57:38,360 --> 09:57:38,960
Do you pay

37002
09:57:38,960 --> 09:57:39,540
no regard to

37003
09:57:39,540 --> 09:57:39,920
the wishes

37004
09:57:39,920 --> 09:57:41,000
of his friends,

37005
09:57:41,000 --> 09:57:41,960
to his tacit

37006
09:57:41,960 --> 09:57:42,840
engagement with Mr.

37007
09:57:42,840 --> 09:57:43,640
Berg?

37008
09:57:43,640 --> 09:57:44,700
Are you lost to

37009
09:57:44,700 --> 09:57:45,600
every feeling

37010
09:57:45,600 --> 09:57:46,340
of, propriety

37011
09:57:46,340 --> 09:57:47,540
and delicacy?

37012
09:57:47,660 --> 09:57:48,420
Have you not

37013
09:57:48,420 --> 09:57:49,260
heard me say that

37014
09:57:49,260 --> 09:57:50,660
from his earliest hours

37015
09:57:50,660 --> 09:57:51,540
he was destined

37016
09:57:51,540 --> 09:57:52,740
for his cousin?

37017
09:57:53,220 --> 09:57:53,960
Yes, and

37018
09:57:53,960 --> 09:57:55,160
I had heard it before.

37019
09:57:55,160 --> 09:57:56,380
But is that to me?

37020
09:57:56,780 --> 09:57:57,540
If there is no

37021
09:57:57,540 --> 09:57:58,340
other objection

37022
09:57:58,340 --> 09:57:59,180
to my marrying

37023
09:57:59,180 --> 09:58:00,000
your nephew,

37024
09:58:00,000 --> 09:58:00,320
I shall

37025
09:58:00,320 --> 09:58:00,960
certainly not

37026
09:58:00,960 --> 09:58:01,800
be kept from it.

37027
09:58:01,800 --> 09:58:02,400
By knowing that

37028
09:58:02,400 --> 09:58:03,320
his mother and aunt.

37029
09:58:03,320 --> 09:58:04,400
Wished him to marry Mr.

37030
09:58:04,400 --> 09:58:05,220
Burke.

37031
09:58:05,220 --> 09:58:05,960
You both did

37032
09:58:05,960 --> 09:58:06,960
as much as you could

37033
09:58:06,960 --> 09:58:07,460
in planning

37034
09:58:07,460 --> 09:58:08,160
the marriage.

37035
09:58:08,160 --> 09:58:09,140
Its completion

37036
09:58:09,140 --> 09:58:10,340
depended on others.

37037
09:58:10,820 --> 09:58:11,420
If Mr.

37038
09:58:11,420 --> 09:58:11,940
Darcy.

37039
09:58:11,940 --> 09:58:12,900
Is neither by honor.

37040
09:58:12,900 --> 09:58:13,740
Nor inclination

37041
09:58:13,740 --> 09:58:15,020
confined to his cousin,

37042
09:58:15,240 --> 09:58:16,040
why is he not

37043
09:58:16,040 --> 09:58:17,240
to make another choice?

37044
09:58:17,240 --> 09:58:18,600
And if I am that choice,

37045
09:58:18,600 --> 09:58:19,340
why may I not

37046
09:58:19,340 --> 09:58:19,980
accept him?

37047
09:58:20,940 --> 09:58:21,500
Because.

37048
09:58:21,500 --> 09:58:22,800
Honor, decorum,

37049
09:58:22,800 --> 09:58:23,940
prudence, nay,

37050
09:58:23,940 --> 09:58:25,140
interest, forbid.

37051
09:58:25,580 --> 09:58:26,900
Yes, Miss Bennet.

37052
09:58:26,900 --> 09:58:28,260
Interest four

37053
09:58:28,260 --> 09:58:29,400
Do not expect to be.

37054
09:58:29,400 --> 09:58:30,780
Noticed by his family.

37055
09:58:30,780 --> 09:58:31,580
Or friends.

37056
09:58:31,580 --> 09:58:32,820
If you willfully act

37057
09:58:32,820 --> 09:58:34,020
against the inclinations

37058
09:58:34,020 --> 09:58:35,240
of all, you will be

37059
09:58:35,240 --> 09:58:36,740
censured, slighted,

37060
09:58:36,740 --> 09:58:38,420
and despised by everyone

37061
09:58:38,420 --> 09:58:39,560
connected with him.

37062
09:58:39,560 --> 09:58:40,220
Your alliance

37063
09:58:40,220 --> 09:58:41,420
will be a disgrace.

37064
09:58:41,580 --> 09:58:42,560
Your name will never

37065
09:58:42,560 --> 09:58:43,380
even be mentioned

37066
09:58:43,380 --> 09:58:44,580
by any of us.

37067
09:58:45,320 --> 09:58:46,380
These are heavy

37068
09:58:46,380 --> 09:58:47,580
misfortunes,

37069
09:58:47,580 --> 09:58:48,780
replied Elizabeth.

37070
09:58:48,920 --> 09:58:50,000
But the wife of Mr.

37071
09:58:50,000 --> 09:58:50,900
Darcy must have

37072
09:58:50,900 --> 09:58:51,800
such extraordinary

37073
09:58:51,800 --> 09:58:53,000
sources of happiness

37074
09:58:53,000 --> 09:58:54,200
necessarily attached

37075
09:58:54,240 --> 09:58:55,220
her situation

37076
09:58:55,220 --> 09:58:56,300
that she could, upon

37077
09:58:56,300 --> 09:58:57,560
the whole, have no cause

37078
09:58:57,560 --> 09:58:58,760
to opine.

37079
09:58:59,160 --> 09:59:00,240
Obstinate,

37080
09:59:00,240 --> 09:59:01,440
headstrong girl.

37081
09:59:01,800 --> 09:59:03,480
I am ashamed of you.

37082
09:59:03,960 --> 09:59:05,420
Is this your gratitude

37083
09:59:05,420 --> 09:59:06,180
for my attentions

37084
09:59:06,180 --> 09:59:06,420
to you?

37085
09:59:06,420 --> 09:59:07,580
Last spring

37086
09:59:07,580 --> 09:59:08,720
is nothing do to me

37087
09:59:08,720 --> 09:59:09,920
on that score.

37088
09:59:10,320 --> 09:59:11,660
Let us sit down.

37089
09:59:11,780 --> 09:59:12,360
You are to

37090
09:59:12,360 --> 09:59:13,500
understand, Mr. Bennett.

37091
09:59:13,500 --> 09:59:14,340
That I came here

37092
09:59:14,340 --> 09:59:15,020
with a determined.

37093
09:59:15,020 --> 09:59:15,600
Resolution

37094
09:59:15,600 --> 09:59:16,800
of carrying my purpose.

37095
09:59:16,940 --> 09:59:17,540
Nor will

37096
09:59:17,540 --> 09:59:18,780
I be dissuaded from it.

37097
09:59:19,220 --> 09:59:20,400
I have not been used

37098
09:59:20,400 --> 09:59:20,880
to submit

37099
09:59:20,880 --> 09:59:22,340
to any person's whims.

37100
09:59:22,580 --> 09:59:23,960
I have not in the habit

37101
09:59:23,960 --> 09:59:24,540
of Brooking

37102
09:59:24,540 --> 09:59:25,500
disappointment

37103
09:59:26,660 --> 09:59:27,620
that will make Your

37104
09:59:27,620 --> 09:59:28,580
Ladyship situation

37105
09:59:28,580 --> 09:59:29,060
at present

37106
09:59:29,060 --> 09:59:30,060
more pitiable.

37107
09:59:30,060 --> 09:59:30,600
But it will have

37108
09:59:30,600 --> 09:59:31,820
no effect on me.

37109
09:59:32,240 --> 09:59:34,620
I will be interrupted.

37110
09:59:34,980 --> 09:59:36,560
Hear me in silence.

37111
09:59:37,080 --> 09:59:37,940
My daughter

37112
09:59:37,940 --> 09:59:39,600
and my nephew are formed

37113
09:59:39,600 --> 09:59:40,740
for each other.

37114
09:59:40,740 --> 09:59:41,720
They are descended

37115
09:59:41,720 --> 09:59:42,840
on the maternal side

37116
09:59:42,840 --> 09:59:44,120
from the same noble line

37117
09:59:44,220 --> 09:59:45,120
and on the farthest

37118
09:59:45,120 --> 09:59:46,040
from respectable,

37119
09:59:46,040 --> 09:59:47,240
honorable and ancient,

37120
09:59:47,460 --> 09:59:47,660
though

37121
09:59:47,660 --> 09:59:48,860
one titled families.

37122
09:59:49,220 --> 09:59:50,400
Their fortune on both

37123
09:59:50,400 --> 09:59:51,600
sides is splendid.

37124
09:59:51,900 --> 09:59:52,700
They are destined

37125
09:59:52,700 --> 09:59:53,220
for each other

37126
09:59:53,220 --> 09:59:53,720
by the voice

37127
09:59:53,720 --> 09:59:54,660
of every member

37128
09:59:54,660 --> 09:59:54,860
of their

37129
09:59:54,860 --> 09:59:56,060
respective houses.

37130
09:59:56,220 --> 09:59:57,060
And what is to

37131
09:59:57,060 --> 09:59:58,040
divide them?

37132
09:59:58,040 --> 09:59:58,940
The upstart

37133
09:59:58,940 --> 09:59:59,720
pretensions

37134
09:59:59,720 --> 10:00:00,320
of a young woman

37135
10:00:00,320 --> 10:00:01,080
without family,

37136
10:00:01,080 --> 10:00:02,420
connections or fortune.

37137
10:00:02,900 --> 10:00:04,400
Is this to be endured?

37138
10:00:04,940 --> 10:00:06,300
But it must not.

37139
10:00:06,300 --> 10:00:07,560
Shall not be.

37140
10:00:07,920 --> 10:00:08,540
If you were

37141
10:00:08,540 --> 10:00:09,140
sensible of

37142
10:00:09,140 --> 10:00:09,720
your own good,

37143
10:00:09,720 --> 10:00:10,140
you would not

37144
10:00:10,140 --> 10:00:11,340
wish to quit the sphere

37145
10:00:11,340 --> 10:00:11,820
in which you have

37146
10:00:11,820 --> 10:00:12,360
been brought.

37147
10:00:13,680 --> 10:00:14,880
In marrying your nephew,

37148
10:00:14,880 --> 10:00:15,360
I should not

37149
10:00:15,360 --> 10:00:16,140
consider myself

37150
10:00:16,140 --> 10:00:17,340
as quitting that sphere.

37151
10:00:17,420 --> 10:00:18,440
He is a gentleman.

37152
10:00:18,440 --> 10:00:18,840
I am a

37153
10:00:18,840 --> 10:00:19,860
gentleman's daughter.

37154
10:00:19,860 --> 10:00:21,260
So far we are equal.

37155
10:00:21,920 --> 10:00:22,800
True.

37156
10:00:22,800 --> 10:00:23,540
You are a

37157
10:00:23,540 --> 10:00:24,740
gentleman's daughter.

37158
10:00:25,080 --> 10:00:26,460
But who was your mother?

37159
10:00:26,880 --> 10:00:28,020
Who are your uncles

37160
10:00:28,020 --> 10:00:28,880
and aunts?

37161
10:00:28,880 --> 10:00:30,060
Do not imagine me

37162
10:00:30,060 --> 10:00:30,740
ignorant of

37163
10:00:30,740 --> 10:00:31,940
their condition.

37164
10:00:32,880 --> 10:00:33,440
Whatever

37165
10:00:33,440 --> 10:00:34,940
my connections may be,

37166
10:00:35,180 --> 10:00:36,200
said Elizabeth.

37167
10:00:36,200 --> 10:00:37,140
If your nephew does

37168
10:00:37,140 --> 10:00:37,800
not object to them,

37169
10:00:37,800 --> 10:00:38,160
they can be

37170
10:00:38,160 --> 10:00:39,360
nothing to you.

37171
10:00:39,560 --> 10:00:40,680
Tell me once

37172
10:00:40,680 --> 10:00:41,760
and for all.

37173
10:00:41,760 --> 10:00:42,740
Are You engaged

37174
10:00:42,740 --> 10:00:43,940
to him?

37175
10:00:44,220 --> 10:00:44,460
Though

37176
10:00:44,460 --> 10:00:45,380
Elizabeth would not,

37177
10:00:45,380 --> 10:00:46,200
for the mere purpose

37178
10:00:46,200 --> 10:00:46,820
of obliging

37179
10:00:46,820 --> 10:00:47,540
Lady Catherine

37180
10:00:47,540 --> 10:00:48,060
have answered

37181
10:00:48,060 --> 10:00:49,100
this question.

37182
10:00:49,100 --> 10:00:49,880
She could not but.

37183
10:00:49,880 --> 10:00:50,940
Say after a moment's

37184
10:00:50,940 --> 10:00:52,140
deliberation.

37185
10:00:52,580 --> 10:00:53,780
I am not.

37186
10:00:54,200 --> 10:00:54,980
Lady Catherine

37187
10:00:54,980 --> 10:00:56,180
seemed pleased.

37188
10:00:56,580 --> 10:00:57,840
And will you promise me

37189
10:00:57,840 --> 10:00:58,740
never to enter into

37190
10:00:58,740 --> 10:00:59,700
such an engagement?

37191
10:01:00,680 --> 10:01:01,580
I will make

37192
10:01:01,580 --> 10:01:02,780
promise of the kind.

37193
10:01:03,320 --> 10:01:04,520
Miss Bennet,

37194
10:01:04,860 --> 10:01:05,960
I am shocked

37195
10:01:05,960 --> 10:01:07,160
and astonished.

37196
10:01:07,260 --> 10:01:08,400
I expected to find

37197
10:01:08,400 --> 10:01:09,300
a more reasonable

37198
10:01:09,300 --> 10:01:10,320
young woman.

37199
10:01:10,320 --> 10:01:11,000
But do not

37200
10:01:11,000 --> 10:01:11,960
deceive yourself

37201
10:01:11,960 --> 10:01:12,600
into a belief

37202
10:01:12,600 --> 10:01:13,860
that I will ever recede.

37203
10:01:14,180 --> 10:01:15,200
I shall not go away

37204
10:01:15,200 --> 10:01:15,800
till you have given me

37205
10:01:15,800 --> 10:01:17,000
the assurance I require.

37206
10:01:17,640 --> 10:01:18,740
And I certainly

37207
10:01:18,740 --> 10:01:19,940
never shall give it.

37208
10:01:20,280 --> 10:01:21,140
I am not to be

37209
10:01:21,140 --> 10:01:21,860
intimidated

37210
10:01:21,860 --> 10:01:22,380
into anything

37211
10:01:22,380 --> 10:01:23,940
so wholly unreasonable.

37212
10:01:24,420 --> 10:01:25,680
Your Ladyship wants Mr.

37213
10:01:25,680 --> 10:01:26,040
Darcy

37214
10:01:26,040 --> 10:01:27,240
to marry your daughter.

37215
10:01:27,300 --> 10:01:28,620
But would my giving you

37216
10:01:28,620 --> 10:01:29,540
the wished for promise

37217
10:01:29,540 --> 10:01:30,300
make that marriage

37218
10:01:30,300 --> 10:01:31,500
at all more probable?

37219
10:01:31,740 --> 10:01:32,400
Supposing him

37220
10:01:32,400 --> 10:01:33,600
to be attached to me?

37221
10:01:33,740 --> 10:01:34,580
What am I refusing

37222
10:01:34,580 --> 10:01:35,440
to accept his hand

37223
10:01:35,440 --> 10:01:35,780
to make him

37224
10:01:35,780 --> 10:01:36,500
wish to bestow it

37225
10:01:36,500 --> 10:01:37,700
on his cousin?

37226
10:01:37,880 --> 10:01:38,420
Allow me.

37227
10:01:38,420 --> 10:01:38,840
To say,

37228
10:01:38,840 --> 10:01:39,540
Lady Catherine,

37229
10:01:39,540 --> 10:01:39,860
that the.

37230
10:01:39,860 --> 10:01:40,500
Arguments

37231
10:01:40,500 --> 10:01:40,940
which you have

37232
10:01:40,940 --> 10:01:41,840
supported this

37233
10:01:41,840 --> 10:01:42,740
extraordinary

37234
10:01:42,740 --> 10:01:44,100
application have been

37235
10:01:44,100 --> 10:01:44,660
as frivolous

37236
10:01:44,660 --> 10:01:45,480
as the application

37237
10:01:45,480 --> 10:01:46,680
was ill judged.

37238
10:01:46,700 --> 10:01:47,000
You have

37239
10:01:47,000 --> 10:01:48,200
wisely mistaken.

37240
10:01:48,200 --> 10:01:49,140
My. Character.

37241
10:01:49,140 --> 10:01:49,800
If you think I

37242
10:01:49,800 --> 10:01:50,660
can be worked

37243
10:01:50,660 --> 10:01:51,800
by such persuasions

37244
10:01:51,800 --> 10:01:52,940
as these,

37245
10:01:52,940 --> 10:01:54,060
how far your nephew

37246
10:01:54,060 --> 10:01:54,540
might approve

37247
10:01:54,540 --> 10:01:55,380
of your interference in.

37248
10:01:55,380 --> 10:01:55,940
His affairs.

37249
10:01:55,940 --> 10:01:57,120
I cannot tell.

37250
10:01:57,120 --> 10:01:57,480
But do you

37251
10:01:57,480 --> 10:01:58,740
have certainly no right

37252
10:01:58,740 --> 10:01:59,180
to concern

37253
10:01:59,180 --> 10:02:00,380
yourself in mine?

37254
10:02:00,480 --> 10:02:01,220
I must. Beg.

37255
10:02:01,220 --> 10:02:01,740
Therefore, to

37256
10:02:01,740 --> 10:02:02,420
be important.

37257
10:02:02,420 --> 10:02:03,120
No father.

37258
10:02:03,120 --> 10:02:03,300
On the.

37259
10:02:03,300 --> 10:02:04,500
Subject.

37260
10:02:04,520 --> 10:02:06,180
Not so hasty,

37261
10:02:06,180 --> 10:02:07,100
if you please.

37262
10:02:07,100 --> 10:02:09,000
I have by no means done

37263
10:02:09,500 --> 10:02:10,760
to all the objection

37264
10:02:10,860 --> 10:02:12,060
I have already urged.

37265
10:02:12,140 --> 10:02:12,780
I have still

37266
10:02:12,780 --> 10:02:13,980
another to add.

37267
10:02:14,100 --> 10:02:15,260
I am no stranger

37268
10:02:15,260 --> 10:02:16,020
to the particulars

37269
10:02:16,020 --> 10:02:16,280
of your

37270
10:02:16,280 --> 10:02:17,220
youngest sister's

37271
10:02:17,220 --> 10:02:18,420
infamous elopement.

37272
10:02:18,620 --> 10:02:20,340
I know it all that

37273
10:02:20,340 --> 10:02:21,000
the young man's

37274
10:02:21,000 --> 10:02:21,620
marrying her

37275
10:02:21,620 --> 10:02:21,840
was a

37276
10:02:21,840 --> 10:02:23,040
patched up business

37277
10:02:23,220 --> 10:02:24,180
at the expense

37278
10:02:24,180 --> 10:02:24,800
of your father

37279
10:02:24,800 --> 10:02:26,000
and uncles.

37280
10:02:26,100 --> 10:02:27,780
And is such a girl to be

37281
10:02:27,780 --> 10:02:29,160
my nephew's sister.

37282
10:02:29,660 --> 10:02:30,860
Is her husband

37283
10:02:30,900 --> 10:02:32,280
is the son of his late

37284
10:02:32,280 --> 10:02:33,260
father Stewart.

37285
10:02:33,260 --> 10:02:34,460
To be his brother.

37286
10:02:34,620 --> 10:02:35,820
Heaven and earth.

37287
10:02:36,180 --> 10:02:36,740
Of What

37288
10:02:36,740 --> 10:02:37,940
are you thinking?

37289
10:02:37,980 --> 10:02:38,280
Are the.

37290
10:02:38,280 --> 10:02:38,820
Shades.

37291
10:02:38,820 --> 10:02:39,500
Of Pemberley

37292
10:02:39,500 --> 10:02:40,760
to be thus polluted?

37293
10:02:41,940 --> 10:02:42,860
You can now have.

37294
10:02:42,860 --> 10:02:44,300
Nothing further to say.

37295
10:02:44,700 --> 10:02:45,480
She resentfully.

37296
10:02:45,480 --> 10:02:46,440
Answered.

37297
10:02:46,440 --> 10:02:47,720
You have insulted me in

37298
10:02:47,720 --> 10:02:49,080
every possible method.

37299
10:02:49,280 --> 10:02:50,580
I must beg to return

37300
10:02:50,660 --> 10:02:51,440
the house.

37301
10:02:51,440 --> 10:02:52,380
And she rose

37302
10:02:52,380 --> 10:02:53,460
as she spoke.

37303
10:02:53,460 --> 10:02:54,300
Lady Catherine

37304
10:02:54,300 --> 10:02:55,040
Rose also.

37305
10:02:55,040 --> 10:02:56,240
And they turned back.

37306
10:02:56,280 --> 10:02:57,180
Her Ladyship was

37307
10:02:57,180 --> 10:02:58,380
highly incensed.

37308
10:02:58,920 --> 10:03:00,120
You have no regard.

37309
10:03:00,120 --> 10:03:00,860
Then, for honor

37310
10:03:00,860 --> 10:03:01,580
and credit of my.

37311
10:03:01,580 --> 10:03:02,340
Nephew.

37312
10:03:02,340 --> 10:03:03,920
Unfeeling, selfish girl.

37313
10:03:04,440 --> 10:03:05,420
Do you not consider

37314
10:03:05,420 --> 10:03:06,060
that a connection

37315
10:03:06,060 --> 10:03:06,300
with you?

37316
10:03:06,300 --> 10:03:07,100
Must disgrace him

37317
10:03:07,100 --> 10:03:07,580
in the eyes

37318
10:03:07,580 --> 10:03:08,780
of everybody.

37319
10:03:09,360 --> 10:03:10,220
Lady Catherine,

37320
10:03:10,220 --> 10:03:11,420
I have nothing further

37321
10:03:11,420 --> 10:03:12,020
to say.

37322
10:03:12,020 --> 10:03:13,560
You know my sentiments.

37323
10:03:14,220 --> 10:03:14,880
You are then

37324
10:03:14,880 --> 10:03:16,140
resolved to have him.

37325
10:03:16,800 --> 10:03:17,540
I have said no

37326
10:03:17,540 --> 10:03:18,380
such thing.

37327
10:03:18,380 --> 10:03:19,380
I am only resolved

37328
10:03:19,380 --> 10:03:20,520
to act in that manner,

37329
10:03:20,520 --> 10:03:20,900
which will,

37330
10:03:20,900 --> 10:03:21,440
in my own

37331
10:03:21,440 --> 10:03:22,460
opinion, constitute

37332
10:03:22,460 --> 10:03:23,300
my happiness

37333
10:03:23,300 --> 10:03:24,540
without reference to you

37334
10:03:24,660 --> 10:03:25,740
or to any person so

37335
10:03:25,740 --> 10:03:26,840
wholly unconnected

37336
10:03:26,840 --> 10:03:28,040
with me.

37337
10:03:28,160 --> 10:03:29,360
It is well,

37338
10:03:29,520 --> 10:03:30,360
he refused

37339
10:03:30,360 --> 10:03:31,560
then to oblige me.

37340
10:03:31,620 --> 10:03:32,540
You refuse to obey

37341
10:03:32,540 --> 10:03:33,560
the claims of duty,

37342
10:03:33,560 --> 10:03:34,760
honor and gratitude.

37343
10:03:35,060 --> 10:03:35,940
You are determined

37344
10:03:35,940 --> 10:03:36,680
to ruin him

37345
10:03:36,680 --> 10:03:37,200
and the opinion

37346
10:03:37,200 --> 10:03:38,180
of all his friends

37347
10:03:38,180 --> 10:03:38,880
and to make him the

37348
10:03:38,880 --> 10:03:40,080
contempt of the world.

37349
10:03:41,160 --> 10:03:42,320
Neither duty

37350
10:03:42,320 --> 10:03:43,500
nor honor, nor.

37351
10:03:43,500 --> 10:03:44,540
Gratitude,

37352
10:03:44,540 --> 10:03:45,740
replied Elizabeth.

37353
10:03:45,840 --> 10:03:46,820
Have any possible.

37354
10:03:46,820 --> 10:03:47,480
Claim on me

37355
10:03:47,480 --> 10:03:48,000
in the present.

37356
10:03:48,000 --> 10:03:48,980
Instance.

37357
10:03:48,980 --> 10:03:49,800
No principle.

37358
10:03:49,800 --> 10:03:50,300
Of either.

37359
10:03:50,300 --> 10:03:51,020
Would be violated

37360
10:03:51,020 --> 10:03:52,100
by my marriage with Mr.

37361
10:03:52,100 --> 10:03:53,600
D'Arcy and with regard

37362
10:03:53,600 --> 10:03:54,200
to the resentment

37363
10:03:54,200 --> 10:03:55,200
of his family

37364
10:03:55,200 --> 10:03:56,240
or the indignation

37365
10:03:56,240 --> 10:03:57,320
of the world.

37366
10:03:57,320 --> 10:03:58,100
If the former

37367
10:03:58,100 --> 10:03:58,980
were excited.

37368
10:03:58,980 --> 10:03:59,720
By his marrying.

37369
10:03:59,720 --> 10:04:00,540
Me, it would not give me

37370
10:04:00,540 --> 10:04:01,820
one moment's concern

37371
10:04:02,160 --> 10:04:02,840
and the world.

37372
10:04:02,840 --> 10:04:03,320
In general.

37373
10:04:03,320 --> 10:04:03,620
Would have

37374
10:04:03,620 --> 10:04:04,560
too much sense

37375
10:04:04,560 --> 10:04:05,760
to join in the scorn.

37376
10:04:06,540 --> 10:04:07,520
And this is

37377
10:04:07,520 --> 10:04:08,720
your real opinion.

37378
10:04:08,880 --> 10:04:10,500
This is final resolve.

37379
10:04:11,160 --> 10:04:12,360
Very well.

37380
10:04:12,560 --> 10:04:13,380
I shall now

37381
10:04:13,380 --> 10:04:14,580
know how to act.

37382
10:04:14,660 --> 10:04:15,720
Do not imagine,

37383
10:04:15,720 --> 10:04:16,260
Miss Bennet,

37384
10:04:16,260 --> 10:04:16,980
that your ambition

37385
10:04:16,980 --> 10:04:18,200
will ever be gratified.

37386
10:04:18,680 --> 10:04:20,360
I to try you.

37387
10:04:20,760 --> 10:04:21,800
I hoped to find

37388
10:04:21,800 --> 10:04:22,760
you reasonable,

37389
10:04:22,760 --> 10:04:23,780
but depend upon it.

37390
10:04:23,780 --> 10:04:25,760
I will carry my point.

37391
10:04:26,880 --> 10:04:27,720
In this manner.

37392
10:04:27,720 --> 10:04:28,920
Lady Catherine talked

37393
10:04:29,000 --> 10:04:29,400
till they were

37394
10:04:29,400 --> 10:04:29,900
at the door

37395
10:04:29,900 --> 10:04:30,920
of the carriage.

37396
10:04:30,920 --> 10:04:31,500
When turning

37397
10:04:31,500 --> 10:04:32,220
hastily round,

37398
10:04:32,220 --> 10:04:33,260
she added.

37399
10:04:33,260 --> 10:04:34,340
I take no leave of you,

37400
10:04:34,340 --> 10:04:35,120
Miss Bennet.

37401
10:04:35,120 --> 10:04:36,080
I send no

37402
10:04:36,080 --> 10:04:36,720
compliments to

37403
10:04:36,720 --> 10:04:37,520
your mother.

37404
10:04:37,520 --> 10:04:38,720
You deserve no such.

37405
10:04:39,500 --> 10:04:41,520
I am most seriously

37406
10:04:41,520 --> 10:04:42,860
displeased.

37407
10:04:44,160 --> 10:04:44,940
Elizabeth made

37408
10:04:44,940 --> 10:04:46,380
no answer, and without

37409
10:04:46,380 --> 10:04:46,800
attempting

37410
10:04:46,800 --> 10:04:47,900
to persuade her Ladyship

37411
10:04:47,900 --> 10:04:48,480
to return into,

37412
10:04:48,480 --> 10:04:49,160
the house.

37413
10:04:49,160 --> 10:04:49,520
Walked.

37414
10:04:49,520 --> 10:04:51,000
Quietly into it herself.

37415
10:04:51,480 --> 10:04:52,400
She heard the carriage

37416
10:04:52,400 --> 10:04:52,980
drive away

37417
10:04:52,980 --> 10:04:53,600
as she proceeded

37418
10:04:53,600 --> 10:04:54,660
upstairs.

37419
10:04:54,660 --> 10:04:55,620
Her mother impatiently

37420
10:04:55,620 --> 10:04:56,300
met her at the door

37421
10:04:56,300 --> 10:04:57,260
of the dressing room

37422
10:04:57,260 --> 10:04:57,960
to ask why

37423
10:04:57,960 --> 10:04:58,620
Lady Catherine

37424
10:04:58,620 --> 10:04:59,520
would not come in again

37425
10:04:59,520 --> 10:05:00,720
and rest herself.

37426
10:05:01,020 --> 10:05:02,220
She did not choose it.

37427
10:05:02,580 --> 10:05:03,540
Said her daughter.

37428
10:05:03,540 --> 10:05:04,740
She would go.

37429
10:05:05,340 --> 10:05:06,480
She is a very fine

37430
10:05:06,480 --> 10:05:07,280
looking woman

37431
10:05:07,280 --> 10:05:08,420
and her calling here

37432
10:05:08,420 --> 10:05:08,940
prodigiously.

37433
10:05:08,940 --> 10:05:10,260
Civil society

37434
10:05:10,260 --> 10:05:10,560
came,

37435
10:05:10,560 --> 10:05:11,360
I suppose, to tell us

37436
10:05:11,360 --> 10:05:12,560
the Collins's were well,

37437
10:05:12,660 --> 10:05:13,500
She is on her road

37438
10:05:13,500 --> 10:05:14,700
somewhere, I daresay.

37439
10:05:14,780 --> 10:05:15,680
And so passing

37440
10:05:15,680 --> 10:05:16,160
through Merritt

37441
10:05:16,160 --> 10:05:16,820
and thought she might

37442
10:05:16,820 --> 10:05:18,020
as well call on you.

37443
10:05:18,080 --> 10:05:18,540
I suppose

37444
10:05:18,540 --> 10:05:18,980
she had nothing

37445
10:05:18,980 --> 10:05:19,680
particular to say

37446
10:05:19,680 --> 10:05:20,280
to you, Dizzy.

37447
10:05:21,240 --> 10:05:21,960
Elizabeth was

37448
10:05:21,960 --> 10:05:22,680
forced to give in

37449
10:05:22,680 --> 10:05:23,060
to a little

37450
10:05:23,060 --> 10:05:24,180
falsehood here

37451
10:05:24,180 --> 10:05:24,980
for to acknowledge

37452
10:05:24,980 --> 10:05:25,680
the substance of

37453
10:05:25,680 --> 10:05:26,660
their conversation

37454
10:05:26,660 --> 10:05:27,860
was impossible.

37455
10:05:30,000 --> 10:05:31,260
Chapter 57

37456
10:05:32,480 --> 10:05:32,840
The dis

37457
10:05:32,840 --> 10:05:34,100
composure of spirits,

37458
10:05:34,100 --> 10:05:34,500
which this

37459
10:05:34,500 --> 10:05:35,600
extraordinary visit

37460
10:05:35,600 --> 10:05:36,800
through Elizabeth into,

37461
10:05:36,980 --> 10:05:37,580
could not be

37462
10:05:37,580 --> 10:05:38,780
easily overcome.

37463
10:05:39,060 --> 10:05:39,900
Nor could she

37464
10:05:39,900 --> 10:05:40,760
for many hours

37465
10:05:40,760 --> 10:05:41,640
learn to think of it

37466
10:05:41,640 --> 10:05:42,900
less than incessantly.

37467
10:05:43,380 --> 10:05:44,240
Lady Catherine,

37468
10:05:44,240 --> 10:05:44,720
it appeared,

37469
10:05:44,720 --> 10:05:45,380
had actually

37470
10:05:45,380 --> 10:05:46,140
taken the trouble

37471
10:05:46,140 --> 10:05:46,760
of this journey

37472
10:05:46,760 --> 10:05:47,720
from Rose ings

37473
10:05:47,720 --> 10:05:48,800
for the sole purpose

37474
10:05:48,800 --> 10:05:49,620
of breaking off her

37475
10:05:49,620 --> 10:05:50,760
supposed engagement

37476
10:05:50,760 --> 10:05:51,180
with Mr.

37477
10:05:51,180 --> 10:05:52,220
Darcy.

37478
10:05:52,220 --> 10:05:53,160
It was a rational

37479
10:05:53,160 --> 10:05:54,360
scheme, to be sure,

37480
10:05:54,560 --> 10:05:55,620
but from what the report

37481
10:05:55,620 --> 10:05:56,360
of their engagement

37482
10:05:56,360 --> 10:05:57,320
could originate.

37483
10:05:57,320 --> 10:05:58,560
Elizabeth was at a loss

37484
10:05:58,560 --> 10:05:59,640
to imagine

37485
10:05:59,640 --> 10:06:00,720
till she recollected

37486
10:06:00,720 --> 10:06:01,340
that his

37487
10:06:01,340 --> 10:06:02,040
being the intimate

37488
10:06:02,040 --> 10:06:03,060
friend of Bingley

37489
10:06:03,060 --> 10:06:03,960
and her being

37490
10:06:03,960 --> 10:06:05,160
the sister of Jane

37491
10:06:05,180 --> 10:06:06,600
was enough at a time

37492
10:06:06,600 --> 10:06:07,620
when the expectation

37493
10:06:07,620 --> 10:06:08,300
of one wedding

37494
10:06:08,300 --> 10:06:09,240
made everybody eager

37495
10:06:09,240 --> 10:06:10,140
for another

37496
10:06:10,140 --> 10:06:11,480
to supply the idea.

37497
10:06:11,960 --> 10:06:13,080
She had not herself

37498
10:06:13,080 --> 10:06:14,120
forgotten to feel

37499
10:06:14,120 --> 10:06:14,700
that the marriage

37500
10:06:14,700 --> 10:06:15,300
of her sister

37501
10:06:15,300 --> 10:06:15,960
must bring them

37502
10:06:15,960 --> 10:06:17,160
more frequently together

37503
10:06:17,520 --> 10:06:18,360
and her neighbors

37504
10:06:18,360 --> 10:06:19,280
at Lucas Lodge.

37505
10:06:19,280 --> 10:06:20,120
Therefore,

37506
10:06:20,120 --> 10:06:20,600
for through

37507
10:06:20,600 --> 10:06:21,360
their communication

37508
10:06:21,360 --> 10:06:22,200
with the Collins's,

37509
10:06:22,200 --> 10:06:23,460
the report she concluded

37510
10:06:23,460 --> 10:06:23,900
had reached.

37511
10:06:23,900 --> 10:06:25,020
Lady Catherine

37512
10:06:25,020 --> 10:06:26,460
had only sat that down

37513
10:06:26,460 --> 10:06:27,440
as almost certain

37514
10:06:27,440 --> 10:06:28,280
and immediate.

37515
10:06:28,280 --> 10:06:28,980
Which she had.

37516
10:06:28,980 --> 10:06:29,540
Looked forward

37517
10:06:29,540 --> 10:06:30,560
to as possible

37518
10:06:30,560 --> 10:06:31,760
at some future time.

37519
10:06:32,640 --> 10:06:33,380
In revolving

37520
10:06:33,380 --> 10:06:34,100
Lady Katherine's

37521
10:06:34,100 --> 10:06:35,300
expressions, however.

37522
10:06:35,340 --> 10:06:36,060
She could not help.

37523
10:06:36,060 --> 10:06:37,280
Feeling some uneasiness

37524
10:06:37,280 --> 10:06:37,680
as to the

37525
10:06:37,680 --> 10:06:38,780
possible consequence

37526
10:06:38,780 --> 10:06:39,660
of her persisting

37527
10:06:39,660 --> 10:06:40,860
in this interference

37528
10:06:41,120 --> 10:06:41,840
from what she had

37529
10:06:41,840 --> 10:06:42,900
said of her resolution

37530
10:06:42,900 --> 10:06:43,340
to prevent

37531
10:06:43,340 --> 10:06:44,180
their marriage.

37532
10:06:44,180 --> 10:06:45,320
It occurred to Elizabeth

37533
10:06:45,320 --> 10:06:46,520
that she must meditate

37534
10:06:46,580 --> 10:06:47,340
application to

37535
10:06:47,340 --> 10:06:48,080
her nephew

37536
10:06:48,080 --> 10:06:49,340
and how he might take

37537
10:06:49,340 --> 10:06:50,580
a similar representation

37538
10:06:50,580 --> 10:06:51,200
of the evils

37539
10:06:51,200 --> 10:06:52,260
attached to a connection

37540
10:06:52,260 --> 10:06:52,860
with her.

37541
10:06:52,860 --> 10:06:54,200
She dared not pronounce.

37542
10:06:54,540 --> 10:06:55,020
She knew

37543
10:06:55,020 --> 10:06:56,180
not the exact degree

37544
10:06:56,180 --> 10:06:56,880
of his affection

37545
10:06:56,880 --> 10:06:57,740
for his aunt

37546
10:06:57,740 --> 10:06:58,680
or his dependance

37547
10:06:58,680 --> 10:06:59,940
on her judgment, but

37548
10:06:59,940 --> 10:07:00,560
it was natural

37549
10:07:00,560 --> 10:07:01,200
to suppose

37550
10:07:01,200 --> 10:07:01,680
that he thought

37551
10:07:01,680 --> 10:07:02,220
much higher

37552
10:07:02,220 --> 10:07:02,960
of her ladyship

37553
10:07:02,960 --> 10:07:04,080
than she could do.

37554
10:07:04,080 --> 10:07:04,920
And it was certain

37555
10:07:04,920 --> 10:07:06,060
that in enumerating

37556
10:07:06,060 --> 10:07:07,020
miseries of a marriage

37557
10:07:07,020 --> 10:07:07,800
with one.

37558
10:07:07,800 --> 10:07:08,460
Whose immediate.

37559
10:07:08,460 --> 10:07:09,000
Connections

37560
10:07:09,000 --> 10:07:10,160
were so unequal to his.

37561
10:07:10,160 --> 10:07:10,740
Own.

37562
10:07:10,740 --> 10:07:11,420
His aunt would

37563
10:07:11,420 --> 10:07:12,000
address him

37564
10:07:12,000 --> 10:07:12,680
on his weakest.

37565
10:07:12,680 --> 10:07:14,000
Side with his.

37566
10:07:14,000 --> 10:07:15,200
Notions of dignity.

37567
10:07:15,360 --> 10:07:16,440
He would probably feel

37568
10:07:16,440 --> 10:07:17,360
that the arguments

37569
10:07:17,360 --> 10:07:18,360
which to Elizabeth

37570
10:07:18,360 --> 10:07:18,780
had appeared

37571
10:07:18,780 --> 10:07:19,980
weak and ridiculous.

37572
10:07:20,160 --> 10:07:20,640
Contained.

37573
10:07:20,640 --> 10:07:21,620
Much good sense

37574
10:07:21,620 --> 10:07:22,940
and solid reasoning.

37575
10:07:23,820 --> 10:07:24,840
If he had been wavering.

37576
10:07:24,840 --> 10:07:25,500
Before as

37577
10:07:25,500 --> 10:07:26,300
what he should do,

37578
10:07:26,300 --> 10:07:27,060
which had often

37579
10:07:27,060 --> 10:07:28,200
seemed likely,

37580
10:07:28,200 --> 10:07:28,860
the advice

37581
10:07:28,860 --> 10:07:30,060
and entreaty of so near

37582
10:07:30,060 --> 10:07:30,560
relation

37583
10:07:30,560 --> 10:07:31,760
might settle every doubt

37584
10:07:31,940 --> 10:07:32,900
and determine him

37585
10:07:32,900 --> 10:07:34,140
at once to be as happy

37586
10:07:34,140 --> 10:07:35,400
as dignity, unblemished

37587
10:07:35,540 --> 10:07:36,440
make him.

37588
10:07:36,440 --> 10:07:37,260
In that case,

37589
10:07:37,260 --> 10:07:38,460
he would return no more.

37590
10:07:38,760 --> 10:07:39,720
Lady Catherine might

37591
10:07:39,720 --> 10:07:40,440
see him in her way

37592
10:07:40,440 --> 10:07:41,220
through town

37593
10:07:41,220 --> 10:07:42,080
and his engagement

37594
10:07:42,080 --> 10:07:42,540
to Bingley.

37595
10:07:42,540 --> 10:07:43,280
If coming again to

37596
10:07:43,280 --> 10:07:44,420
Netherfield must

37597
10:07:44,420 --> 10:07:45,060
give way.

37598
10:07:46,280 --> 10:07:47,280
If therefore

37599
10:07:47,280 --> 10:07:47,900
an excuse

37600
10:07:47,900 --> 10:07:48,240
for not

37601
10:07:48,240 --> 10:07:49,100
keeping his promise

37602
10:07:49,100 --> 10:07:49,980
to come to his friend

37603
10:07:49,980 --> 10:07:51,180
within a few days.

37604
10:07:51,240 --> 10:07:52,320
She added,

37605
10:07:52,320 --> 10:07:53,180
I shall know how

37606
10:07:53,180 --> 10:07:54,380
to understand it.

37607
10:07:54,440 --> 10:07:55,620
I shall give over

37608
10:07:55,620 --> 10:07:56,820
every expectation,

37609
10:07:57,000 --> 10:07:57,740
every wish

37610
10:07:57,740 --> 10:07:58,940
of his constancy.

37611
10:07:59,160 --> 10:08:00,240
If he is satisfied

37612
10:08:00,240 --> 10:08:01,440
with only regretting me

37613
10:08:01,620 --> 10:08:02,100
when he might

37614
10:08:02,100 --> 10:08:02,600
have obtained

37615
10:08:02,600 --> 10:08:03,920
my affections and hand,

37616
10:08:04,320 --> 10:08:05,360
I shall cease to.

37617
10:08:05,360 --> 10:08:06,620
Regret him at all.

37618
10:08:07,220 --> 10:08:07,880
The surprise

37619
10:08:07,880 --> 10:08:08,340
of the rest

37620
10:08:08,340 --> 10:08:09,620
of the family on hearing

37621
10:08:09,620 --> 10:08:10,260
who their visitor

37622
10:08:10,260 --> 10:08:11,460
had been was very great,

37623
10:08:11,760 --> 10:08:12,720
but they obligingly

37624
10:08:12,720 --> 10:08:13,640
satisfied it

37625
10:08:13,640 --> 10:08:13,920
with the

37626
10:08:13,920 --> 10:08:15,140
same kind supposition

37627
10:08:15,140 --> 10:08:16,200
which had appeased Mrs.

37628
10:08:16,200 --> 10:08:17,400
Bennett's curiosity.

37629
10:08:17,520 --> 10:08:18,720
And Elizabeth was spared

37630
10:08:18,720 --> 10:08:19,680
from much teasing

37631
10:08:19,680 --> 10:08:20,880
on the subject.

37632
10:08:21,120 --> 10:08:21,980
The next morning,

37633
10:08:21,980 --> 10:08:22,400
as she was

37634
10:08:22,400 --> 10:08:23,540
going downstairs,

37635
10:08:23,540 --> 10:08:24,900
she was met her father,

37636
10:08:25,040 --> 10:08:25,560
who came out

37637
10:08:25,560 --> 10:08:26,280
of his library

37638
10:08:26,280 --> 10:08:26,760
with a letter

37639
10:08:26,760 --> 10:08:27,960
in his hand.

37640
10:08:27,980 --> 10:08:29,320
Lizzie said, here.

37641
10:08:29,600 --> 10:08:30,140
I was going to

37642
10:08:30,140 --> 10:08:30,740
look for you.

37643
10:08:30,740 --> 10:08:31,940
Come into my room.

37644
10:08:32,420 --> 10:08:33,240
She followed him

37645
10:08:33,240 --> 10:08:33,800
thither,

37646
10:08:33,800 --> 10:08:34,820
and her curiosity

37647
10:08:34,820 --> 10:08:35,100
to know

37648
10:08:35,100 --> 10:08:35,880
what he had to tell

37649
10:08:35,880 --> 10:08:36,540
her was heightened

37650
10:08:36,540 --> 10:08:37,380
by the supposition

37651
10:08:37,380 --> 10:08:37,640
of its

37652
10:08:37,640 --> 10:08:38,520
being in some manner

37653
10:08:38,520 --> 10:08:39,000
connected

37654
10:08:39,000 --> 10:08:40,200
with the letter he held.

37655
10:08:40,500 --> 10:08:41,540
It suddenly struck her

37656
10:08:41,540 --> 10:08:42,120
that it might be

37657
10:08:42,120 --> 10:08:43,280
from Lady Catherine,

37658
10:08:43,280 --> 10:08:44,300
and she anticipated,

37659
10:08:44,300 --> 10:08:45,020
with dismay,

37660
10:08:45,020 --> 10:08:45,300
all the

37661
10:08:45,300 --> 10:08:46,760
consequent explanations.

37662
10:08:47,300 --> 10:08:47,960
She followed her

37663
10:08:47,960 --> 10:08:49,160
father to the fireplace

37664
10:08:49,340 --> 10:08:50,580
and they both sat down.

37665
10:08:51,020 --> 10:08:52,220
He then said.

37666
10:08:52,560 --> 10:08:53,300
I have received

37667
10:08:53,300 --> 10:08:54,260
a letter this morning

37668
10:08:54,260 --> 10:08:55,400
that has astonished me

37669
10:08:55,400 --> 10:08:56,600
exceedingly,

37670
10:08:56,880 --> 10:08:57,680
as it principally

37671
10:08:57,680 --> 10:08:58,580
concerns yourself.

37672
10:08:58,580 --> 10:08:58,880
You ought

37673
10:08:58,880 --> 10:09:00,080
to know its contents.

37674
10:09:01,200 --> 10:09:01,920
I did not know

37675
10:09:01,920 --> 10:09:02,640
before that

37676
10:09:02,640 --> 10:09:03,620
had two daughters

37677
10:09:03,620 --> 10:09:03,840
on the

37678
10:09:03,840 --> 10:09:05,040
brink of matrimony.

37679
10:09:05,180 --> 10:09:06,360
Let me congratulate you

37680
10:09:06,360 --> 10:09:06,740
on a very

37681
10:09:06,740 --> 10:09:07,980
important conquest.

37682
10:09:08,580 --> 10:09:09,300
The color now

37683
10:09:09,300 --> 10:09:09,840
rushed into

37684
10:09:09,840 --> 10:09:10,700
Elizabeth's cheeks

37685
10:09:10,700 --> 10:09:10,920
and the

37686
10:09:10,920 --> 10:09:12,300
instantaneous conviction

37687
10:09:12,480 --> 10:09:13,440
of its being a letter

37688
10:09:13,440 --> 10:09:14,100
from the nephew

37689
10:09:14,100 --> 10:09:15,180
instead of the aunt.

37690
10:09:15,180 --> 10:09:15,480
And she

37691
10:09:15,480 --> 10:09:16,320
was undetermined,

37692
10:09:16,320 --> 10:09:17,000
whether most to be

37693
10:09:17,000 --> 10:09:17,520
pleased that

37694
10:09:17,520 --> 10:09:18,020
he explained

37695
10:09:18,020 --> 10:09:19,040
himself at all

37696
10:09:19,040 --> 10:09:19,740
or offended

37697
10:09:19,740 --> 10:09:20,300
that his letter

37698
10:09:20,300 --> 10:09:20,900
was not rather

37699
10:09:20,900 --> 10:09:22,100
addressed to herself.

37700
10:09:22,100 --> 10:09:22,400
When her

37701
10:09:22,400 --> 10:09:23,600
father continued.

37702
10:09:24,380 --> 10:09:25,580
You look conscious.

37703
10:09:26,240 --> 10:09:27,000
Young ladies

37704
10:09:27,000 --> 10:09:28,100
have great penetration

37705
10:09:28,100 --> 10:09:28,800
in such matters

37706
10:09:28,800 --> 10:09:29,820
as these.

37707
10:09:29,820 --> 10:09:30,900
But I think I may defy

37708
10:09:30,900 --> 10:09:32,420
even your sagacity

37709
10:09:32,540 --> 10:09:33,140
to discover

37710
10:09:33,140 --> 10:09:33,600
the name of

37711
10:09:33,600 --> 10:09:34,800
your admirer.

37712
10:09:35,340 --> 10:09:36,480
This letter is for Mr.

37713
10:09:36,480 --> 10:09:37,580
Collins.

37714
10:09:37,580 --> 10:09:38,060
For Mr.

37715
10:09:38,060 --> 10:09:38,900
Collins.

37716
10:09:38,900 --> 10:09:39,420
And what can

37717
10:09:39,420 --> 10:09:40,620
he have to say?

37718
10:09:40,940 --> 10:09:41,880
Something Very much

37719
10:09:41,880 --> 10:09:42,600
to the purpose,

37720
10:09:42,600 --> 10:09:43,340
of course.

37721
10:09:43,340 --> 10:09:43,880
He begins

37722
10:09:43,880 --> 10:09:45,000
with congratulations

37723
10:09:45,000 --> 10:09:45,780
on the approaching

37724
10:09:45,780 --> 10:09:46,320
nuptials

37725
10:09:46,320 --> 10:09:47,520
of my eldest daughter,

37726
10:09:47,640 --> 10:09:48,500
of which it seems

37727
10:09:48,500 --> 10:09:49,700
he has been told

37728
10:09:49,880 --> 10:09:50,480
by some of the

37729
10:09:50,480 --> 10:09:51,680
good natured

37730
10:09:51,800 --> 10:09:53,000
Lucas's

37731
10:09:53,000 --> 10:09:54,060
I shall not sport

37732
10:09:54,060 --> 10:09:55,080
with your impatience

37733
10:09:55,080 --> 10:09:56,300
by reading what he says

37734
10:09:56,300 --> 10:09:57,180
on that point.

37735
10:09:57,180 --> 10:09:58,560
What relates to yourself

37736
10:09:58,560 --> 10:09:59,760
is as follows.

37737
10:10:00,080 --> 10:10:01,040
Having thus offered you

37738
10:10:01,040 --> 10:10:01,520
the sincere

37739
10:10:01,520 --> 10:10:02,720
congratulations of Mrs.

37740
10:10:02,720 --> 10:10:03,320
Collins and

37741
10:10:03,320 --> 10:10:03,980
myself on this

37742
10:10:03,980 --> 10:10:04,640
happy event,

37743
10:10:05,600 --> 10:10:06,860
let me now add a short

37744
10:10:06,860 --> 10:10:07,320
hint on

37745
10:10:07,320 --> 10:10:08,520
the subject of another

37746
10:10:09,720 --> 10:10:10,100
of which

37747
10:10:10,100 --> 10:10:11,060
we have been advertised

37748
10:10:11,060 --> 10:10:12,300
by the same authority.

37749
10:10:13,200 --> 10:10:13,820
Your daughter,

37750
10:10:13,820 --> 10:10:14,400
Elizabeth,

37751
10:10:14,400 --> 10:10:15,540
it is presumed,

37752
10:10:15,540 --> 10:10:16,440
will not long bear

37753
10:10:16,440 --> 10:10:17,640
the name of Bennett

37754
10:10:18,300 --> 10:10:18,800
after her

37755
10:10:18,800 --> 10:10:19,400
eldest sister

37756
10:10:19,400 --> 10:10:20,040
has resigned.

37757
10:10:20,040 --> 10:10:21,660
It and the chosen

37758
10:10:21,660 --> 10:10:22,860
partner of her fate

37759
10:10:23,360 --> 10:10:24,380
may be reasonably

37760
10:10:24,380 --> 10:10:25,700
looked up to as one of

37761
10:10:25,700 --> 10:10:26,040
the most

37762
10:10:26,040 --> 10:10:27,320
illustrious personages

37763
10:10:27,320 --> 10:10:28,520
in this land.

37764
10:10:29,100 --> 10:10:30,180
Can you possibly guess

37765
10:10:30,180 --> 10:10:30,560
Lizzie,

37766
10:10:30,560 --> 10:10:31,860
who is meant by this?

37767
10:10:32,220 --> 10:10:33,080
This young gentleman

37768
10:10:33,080 --> 10:10:33,680
is blessed

37769
10:10:33,680 --> 10:10:34,680
in a peculiar way,

37770
10:10:34,680 --> 10:10:35,280
with everything

37771
10:10:35,280 --> 10:10:36,140
the heart of mortal

37772
10:10:36,140 --> 10:10:37,340
can most desire,

37773
10:10:39,620 --> 10:10:40,820
splendid property,

37774
10:10:40,820 --> 10:10:41,760
noble kindred,

37775
10:10:41,760 --> 10:10:43,100
and extensive patronage.

37776
10:10:44,900 --> 10:10:45,500
Yet, in spite

37777
10:10:45,500 --> 10:10:45,740
of all

37778
10:10:45,740 --> 10:10:46,940
these temptations,

37779
10:10:47,580 --> 10:10:48,240
let me warn

37780
10:10:48,240 --> 10:10:49,440
my Cousin Elizabeth

37781
10:10:49,680 --> 10:10:50,880
and yourself

37782
10:10:51,320 --> 10:10:52,020
of what evils

37783
10:10:52,020 --> 10:10:52,680
you may incur

37784
10:10:52,680 --> 10:10:53,880
by a precipitate closure

37785
10:10:53,880 --> 10:10:54,180
with this

37786
10:10:54,180 --> 10:10:55,260
gentleman's proposals.

37787
10:10:57,260 --> 10:10:57,500
Which,

37788
10:10:57,500 --> 10:10:58,100
of course, you

37789
10:10:58,100 --> 10:10:58,740
will be inclined

37790
10:10:58,740 --> 10:10:59,400
to take immediate

37791
10:10:59,400 --> 10:11:00,600
advantage of.

37792
10:11:01,440 --> 10:11:01,740
Have you

37793
10:11:01,740 --> 10:11:02,840
any idea, Lizzie, who

37794
10:11:02,840 --> 10:11:04,040
this gentleman is?

37795
10:11:04,100 --> 10:11:05,400
But now it comes out.

37796
10:11:05,460 --> 10:11:06,060
My motive

37797
10:11:06,060 --> 10:11:07,100
for cautioning you

37798
10:11:07,100 --> 10:11:08,220
as follows.

37799
10:11:08,220 --> 10:11:08,940
We have reason to

37800
10:11:08,940 --> 10:11:10,140
imagine that his aunt

37801
10:11:10,620 --> 10:11:11,820
Lady Catherine Nyborg,

37802
10:11:12,240 --> 10:11:12,660
does not

37803
10:11:12,660 --> 10:11:13,440
look on the match

37804
10:11:13,440 --> 10:11:14,640
with a friendly eye.

37805
10:11:16,340 --> 10:11:17,660
Mr., you see,

37806
10:11:17,660 --> 10:11:18,620
is the man.

37807
10:11:18,620 --> 10:11:19,160
Now, Lizzie,

37808
10:11:19,160 --> 10:11:19,580
I think

37809
10:11:19,580 --> 10:11:20,780
I have surprised you.

37810
10:11:20,780 --> 10:11:21,660
Could he or

37811
10:11:21,660 --> 10:11:22,700
the Lucas's

37812
10:11:22,700 --> 10:11:23,960
have pitched on any man

37813
10:11:23,960 --> 10:11:24,740
within the circle

37814
10:11:24,740 --> 10:11:25,940
of our acquaintance

37815
10:11:25,940 --> 10:11:26,780
whose name

37816
10:11:26,780 --> 10:11:27,320
would have given

37817
10:11:27,320 --> 10:11:28,580
the lie more effectually

37818
10:11:28,580 --> 10:11:29,780
to what they related

37819
10:11:30,020 --> 10:11:30,600
to Mr.

37820
10:11:30,600 --> 10:11:31,340
D'Arcy,

37821
10:11:31,340 --> 10:11:31,980
who never looks

37822
10:11:31,980 --> 10:11:32,600
at any woman.

37823
10:11:32,600 --> 10:11:33,800
But to see a blemish

37824
10:11:33,860 --> 10:11:34,620
and who probably

37825
10:11:34,620 --> 10:11:35,660
never looked at you

37826
10:11:35,660 --> 10:11:36,800
in his life.

37827
10:11:36,800 --> 10:11:38,060
It is admirable.

37828
10:11:38,420 --> 10:11:39,680
Elizabeth tried to join

37829
10:11:39,680 --> 10:11:39,860
in her

37830
10:11:39,860 --> 10:11:40,980
father's pleasantry,

37831
10:11:40,980 --> 10:11:42,180
but could only force one

37832
10:11:42,180 --> 10:11:43,520
most reluctant smile.

37833
10:11:43,880 --> 10:11:44,520
Never had

37834
10:11:44,520 --> 10:11:44,960
his wit

37835
10:11:44,960 --> 10:11:45,560
been directed

37836
10:11:45,560 --> 10:11:46,080
in a manner

37837
10:11:46,080 --> 10:11:46,620
so little

37838
10:11:46,620 --> 10:11:47,820
agreeable to her.

37839
10:11:48,080 --> 10:11:49,220
Oh, you're not diverted.

37840
10:11:50,460 --> 10:11:51,660
Oh, yes.

37841
10:11:52,020 --> 10:11:53,100
Read on.

37842
10:11:53,100 --> 10:11:53,900
After mentioning

37843
10:11:53,900 --> 10:11:54,480
the likelihood

37844
10:11:54,480 --> 10:11:55,080
of this marriage

37845
10:11:55,080 --> 10:11:55,800
to Her ladyship

37846
10:11:55,800 --> 10:11:56,960
last night,

37847
10:11:56,960 --> 10:11:57,900
she immediately,

37848
10:11:57,900 --> 10:11:58,320
with her

37849
10:11:58,320 --> 10:11:59,520
usual condescension,

37850
10:11:59,840 --> 10:12:00,900
expressed what she felt

37851
10:12:00,900 --> 10:12:02,100
on the occasion

37852
10:12:02,400 --> 10:12:02,940
when it became

37853
10:12:02,940 --> 10:12:03,660
apparent

37854
10:12:03,660 --> 10:12:04,400
that on the score

37855
10:12:04,400 --> 10:12:05,120
of some family

37856
10:12:05,120 --> 10:12:06,240
objections on the part,

37857
10:12:06,240 --> 10:12:07,220
my cousin,

37858
10:12:07,220 --> 10:12:07,920
she would never give

37859
10:12:07,920 --> 10:12:08,480
her consent

37860
10:12:08,480 --> 10:12:09,540
to what she termed

37861
10:12:09,540 --> 10:12:10,920
so disgraceful a match.

37862
10:12:11,460 --> 10:12:12,360
I thought it my duty

37863
10:12:12,360 --> 10:12:12,620
to give

37864
10:12:12,620 --> 10:12:13,280
the speediest

37865
10:12:13,280 --> 10:12:14,240
intelligence of this

37866
10:12:14,240 --> 10:12:15,840
to my cousin that she,

37867
10:12:15,980 --> 10:12:16,940
her noble admirer,

37868
10:12:16,940 --> 10:12:17,540
may be aware

37869
10:12:17,540 --> 10:12:18,740
of what they are about

37870
10:12:19,140 --> 10:12:20,220
and not run hastily

37871
10:12:20,220 --> 10:12:21,420
into a marriage

37872
10:12:21,540 --> 10:12:22,140
which has not

37873
10:12:22,140 --> 10:12:22,740
been properly

37874
10:12:22,740 --> 10:12:23,940
sanctioned.

37875
10:12:23,940 --> 10:12:24,320
Mr.

37876
10:12:24,320 --> 10:12:25,620
Collins, moreover, adds.

37877
10:12:25,700 --> 10:12:26,880
I'm truly rejoice that

37878
10:12:26,880 --> 10:12:27,560
my cousin Lydia's

37879
10:12:27,560 --> 10:12:28,260
sad business

37880
10:12:28,260 --> 10:12:28,980
has been so well

37881
10:12:28,980 --> 10:12:30,180
hushed up,

37882
10:12:30,380 --> 10:12:31,400
and I'm only concerned

37883
10:12:31,400 --> 10:12:31,680
that they're

37884
10:12:31,680 --> 10:12:32,300
living together

37885
10:12:32,300 --> 10:12:32,660
before the

37886
10:12:32,660 --> 10:12:33,860
marriage took place

37887
10:12:34,020 --> 10:12:34,460
should be so

37888
10:12:34,460 --> 10:12:35,660
generally known.

37889
10:12:36,020 --> 10:12:36,540
I must not,

37890
10:12:36,540 --> 10:12:37,220
however, neglect

37891
10:12:37,220 --> 10:12:38,420
the duties of my station

37892
10:12:39,180 --> 10:12:39,840
or refrain

37893
10:12:39,840 --> 10:12:40,500
from declaring

37894
10:12:40,500 --> 10:12:41,940
my amazement at hearing

37895
10:12:41,940 --> 10:12:42,620
that you received

37896
10:12:42,620 --> 10:12:43,340
the young couple

37897
10:12:43,340 --> 10:12:44,000
into your house

37898
10:12:44,000 --> 10:12:44,580
as soon as they

37899
10:12:44,580 --> 10:12:45,780
were married.

37900
10:12:45,840 --> 10:12:46,800
It was an encouragement

37901
10:12:46,800 --> 10:12:48,020
of Vice, and had

37902
10:12:48,020 --> 10:12:48,240
I been

37903
10:12:48,240 --> 10:12:48,840
the rector of

37904
10:12:48,840 --> 10:12:49,820
Long Bourn,

37905
10:12:49,820 --> 10:12:50,420
I should very

37906
10:12:50,420 --> 10:12:51,240
strenuously have

37907
10:12:51,240 --> 10:12:51,860
opposed it.

37908
10:12:53,300 --> 10:12:53,660
You ought

37909
10:12:53,660 --> 10:12:54,240
certainly to

37910
10:12:54,240 --> 10:12:54,740
forgive them

37911
10:12:54,740 --> 10:12:55,940
as a Christian,

37912
10:12:56,240 --> 10:12:57,260
but never to admit them

37913
10:12:57,260 --> 10:12:58,160
in your sight

37914
10:12:58,160 --> 10:12:59,160
or allow their names

37915
10:12:59,160 --> 10:12:59,360
to be

37916
10:12:59,360 --> 10:12:59,820
mentioned in

37917
10:12:59,820 --> 10:13:01,020
your hearing.

37918
10:13:01,820 --> 10:13:03,200
That is his notion

37919
10:13:03,200 --> 10:13:03,800
of Christian

37920
10:13:03,800 --> 10:13:05,000
forgiveness.

37921
10:13:05,000 --> 10:13:05,900
The rest of his letter

37922
10:13:05,900 --> 10:13:07,020
is only about his dear

37923
10:13:07,020 --> 10:13:08,280
Charlotte situation

37924
10:13:08,420 --> 10:13:09,480
and his expectation

37925
10:13:09,480 --> 10:13:10,740
of a young olive branch.

37926
10:13:11,480 --> 10:13:12,680
But,

37927
10:13:13,440 --> 10:13:14,280
Lizzie, you look as if

37928
10:13:14,280 --> 10:13:15,480
you did not enjoy it.

37929
10:13:15,720 --> 10:13:16,260
You are not going

37930
10:13:16,260 --> 10:13:17,040
to be Mrs..

37931
10:13:17,040 --> 10:13:18,500
I hope and pretend

37932
10:13:18,500 --> 10:13:19,340
to be affronted

37933
10:13:19,340 --> 10:13:20,720
at an idle report

37934
10:13:21,500 --> 10:13:22,700
for what do we live

37935
10:13:22,700 --> 10:13:23,640
but to make sport

37936
10:13:23,640 --> 10:13:24,420
for our neighbors

37937
10:13:24,420 --> 10:13:24,840
and laugh

37938
10:13:24,840 --> 10:13:26,040
at them in our turn.

37939
10:13:26,900 --> 10:13:27,960
Oh, cried.

37940
10:13:27,960 --> 10:13:28,860
Elizabeth.

37941
10:13:28,860 --> 10:13:29,900
I am excessively

37942
10:13:29,900 --> 10:13:30,800
diverted.

37943
10:13:30,800 --> 10:13:32,600
But it is so strange.

37944
10:13:33,300 --> 10:13:34,160
Yes, that is

37945
10:13:34,160 --> 10:13:35,300
what makes it amusing.

37946
10:13:35,300 --> 10:13:36,120
Had they fixed on

37947
10:13:36,120 --> 10:13:36,720
any other man,

37948
10:13:36,720 --> 10:13:37,100
it would have been

37949
10:13:37,100 --> 10:13:37,860
nothing

37950
10:13:37,860 --> 10:13:38,540
but his

37951
10:13:38,540 --> 10:13:39,620
perfect indifference

37952
10:13:39,620 --> 10:13:41,160
and your pointed dislike

37953
10:13:41,160 --> 10:13:41,660
make it so

37954
10:13:41,660 --> 10:13:42,860
delightfully absurd.

37955
10:13:43,340 --> 10:13:44,760
Much dominate writing.

37956
10:13:44,760 --> 10:13:45,740
I would not give up Mr.

37957
10:13:45,740 --> 10:13:46,800
Collins correspondence

37958
10:13:46,800 --> 10:13:48,000
for any consideration.

37959
10:13:48,320 --> 10:13:49,200
Nay, when I read

37960
10:13:49,200 --> 10:13:49,820
a letter of his,

37961
10:13:49,820 --> 10:13:50,460
I cannot help

37962
10:13:50,460 --> 10:13:50,820
giving him

37963
10:13:50,820 --> 10:13:51,320
the preference

37964
10:13:51,320 --> 10:13:52,820
even over Wickham, much

37965
10:13:52,820 --> 10:13:54,300
as I value impudence

37966
10:13:54,300 --> 10:13:55,640
and hypocrisy of my son

37967
10:13:55,640 --> 10:13:56,700
in law.

37968
10:13:56,700 --> 10:13:57,240
And pray.

37969
10:13:57,240 --> 10:13:57,720
Lizzie.

37970
10:13:57,720 --> 10:13:58,400
What said Lady

37971
10:13:58,400 --> 10:13:58,980
Catherine about

37972
10:13:58,980 --> 10:13:59,940
this report?

37973
10:13:59,940 --> 10:14:01,280
Did she call to refuse

37974
10:14:01,280 --> 10:14:02,480
her consent

37975
10:14:02,760 --> 10:14:03,680
to this?

37976
10:14:03,680 --> 10:14:04,220
His daughter

37977
10:14:04,220 --> 10:14:05,120
replied only with a.

37978
10:14:05,120 --> 10:14:06,260
Laugh, and as it.

37979
10:14:06,260 --> 10:14:06,860
Had been asked

37980
10:14:06,860 --> 10:14:07,200
without the

37981
10:14:07,200 --> 10:14:08,220
least suspicion.

37982
10:14:08,220 --> 10:14:08,760
She was not.

37983
10:14:08,760 --> 10:14:09,660
Distressed by his

37984
10:14:09,660 --> 10:14:10,640
repeating it.

37985
10:14:10,640 --> 10:14:11,840
Elizabeth had never been

37986
10:14:11,840 --> 10:14:12,560
more at a loss

37987
10:14:12,560 --> 10:14:13,640
to make her feelings

37988
10:14:13,640 --> 10:14:14,700
what they were not.

37989
10:14:14,700 --> 10:14:15,560
It was necessary

37990
10:14:15,560 --> 10:14:16,140
to laugh

37991
10:14:16,140 --> 10:14:16,520
when she would

37992
10:14:16,520 --> 10:14:17,660
rather have cried.

37993
10:14:17,660 --> 10:14:18,200
Her father

37994
10:14:18,200 --> 10:14:18,600
had most

37995
10:14:18,600 --> 10:14:19,860
cruelly mortified her

37996
10:14:19,880 --> 10:14:20,960
by what he said of Mr.

37997
10:14:20,960 --> 10:14:22,160
Darcy's indifference.

37998
10:14:22,200 --> 10:14:23,100
And she could do nothing

37999
10:14:23,100 --> 10:14:23,640
but wonder

38000
10:14:23,640 --> 10:14:23,940
at such

38001
10:14:23,940 --> 10:14:25,140
a want of penetration.

38002
10:14:25,500 --> 10:14:25,740
Or.

38003
10:14:25,740 --> 10:14:27,000
Fear that perhaps

38004
10:14:27,000 --> 10:14:27,600
instead of his

38005
10:14:27,600 --> 10:14:28,880
seeing too little, she

38006
10:14:28,880 --> 10:14:29,160
might have

38007
10:14:29,160 --> 10:14:30,500
fancied too much.

38008
10:14:31,520 --> 10:14:32,720
Chapter 58

38009
10:14:33,980 --> 10:14:35,120
Instead of receiving

38010
10:14:35,120 --> 10:14:35,900
any such letter

38011
10:14:35,900 --> 10:14:36,540
of excuse

38012
10:14:36,540 --> 10:14:37,460
from his friend

38013
10:14:37,460 --> 10:14:38,160
as Elizabeth

38014
10:14:38,160 --> 10:14:39,180
have expected Mr.

38015
10:14:39,180 --> 10:14:40,200
Bingley to do,

38016
10:14:40,200 --> 10:14:40,820
he was able

38017
10:14:40,820 --> 10:14:41,900
to bring Darcy with him

38018
10:14:41,900 --> 10:14:42,320
too long.

38019
10:14:42,320 --> 10:14:42,900
Born before

38020
10:14:42,900 --> 10:14:43,940
many days had passed

38021
10:14:43,940 --> 10:14:44,420
after Lady

38022
10:14:44,420 --> 10:14:45,620
Katherine's visit.

38023
10:14:45,800 --> 10:14:46,800
The gentleman arrived

38024
10:14:46,800 --> 10:14:48,320
early and before Mrs.

38025
10:14:48,320 --> 10:14:49,080
Bennett had time

38026
10:14:49,080 --> 10:14:49,820
to tell him of their

38027
10:14:49,820 --> 10:14:51,020
having seen his aunt,

38028
10:14:51,180 --> 10:14:51,720
of which her

38029
10:14:51,720 --> 10:14:52,520
daughter sat in

38030
10:14:52,520 --> 10:14:53,720
momentary dread.

38031
10:14:53,880 --> 10:14:54,420
Bingley,

38032
10:14:54,420 --> 10:14:55,260
who wanted to be alone

38033
10:14:55,260 --> 10:14:56,040
with Jane,

38034
10:14:56,040 --> 10:14:56,760
proposed their

38035
10:14:56,760 --> 10:14:57,960
all walking out.

38036
10:14:58,080 --> 10:14:58,740
It was agreed.

38037
10:14:58,740 --> 10:14:59,780
To. Mrs.

38038
10:14:59,780 --> 10:15:00,420
Bennett was not

38039
10:15:00,420 --> 10:15:01,620
in the habit of walking.

38040
10:15:01,680 --> 10:15:03,200
Mary could spare time,

38041
10:15:03,420 --> 10:15:04,520
but the remaining five

38042
10:15:04,520 --> 10:15:05,720
set off together.

38043
10:15:05,900 --> 10:15:06,860
Bingley and Jane,

38044
10:15:06,860 --> 10:15:07,460
however, soon

38045
10:15:07,460 --> 10:15:08,160
allowed the others

38046
10:15:08,160 --> 10:15:09,360
to outstrip them.

38047
10:15:09,380 --> 10:15:10,580
They lagged behind

38048
10:15:10,640 --> 10:15:11,340
while Elizabeth,

38049
10:15:11,340 --> 10:15:12,440
Kitty and Darcy

38050
10:15:12,440 --> 10:15:13,640
to entertain each other.

38051
10:15:14,040 --> 10:15:14,580
Very little

38052
10:15:14,580 --> 10:15:15,780
was said by either.

38053
10:15:15,840 --> 10:15:16,220
Kitty

38054
10:15:16,220 --> 10:15:17,040
was too much afraid

38055
10:15:17,040 --> 10:15:17,900
of him to talk.

38056
10:15:17,900 --> 10:15:18,440
Elizabeth

38057
10:15:18,440 --> 10:15:19,400
was secretly forming

38058
10:15:19,400 --> 10:15:20,600
a desperate resolution,

38059
10:15:20,840 --> 10:15:22,040
and perhaps he might

38060
10:15:22,100 --> 10:15:22,920
doing the same.

38061
10:15:23,880 --> 10:15:24,740
They walked towards.

38062
10:15:24,740 --> 10:15:25,400
The Lucas's

38063
10:15:25,400 --> 10:15:26,300
because Kitty wished

38064
10:15:26,300 --> 10:15:27,500
to call upon Maria,

38065
10:15:27,600 --> 10:15:28,740
and as Elizabeth saw

38066
10:15:28,740 --> 10:15:29,360
no occasion

38067
10:15:29,360 --> 10:15:29,940
for making it

38068
10:15:29,940 --> 10:15:31,140
a general concern.

38069
10:15:31,260 --> 10:15:32,240
When Kitty them,

38070
10:15:32,240 --> 10:15:33,080
she went boldly

38071
10:15:33,080 --> 10:15:34,280
on with him alone.

38072
10:15:34,440 --> 10:15:35,360
Now was the moment

38073
10:15:35,360 --> 10:15:36,200
for her resolution

38074
10:15:36,200 --> 10:15:37,380
to be executed.

38075
10:15:37,380 --> 10:15:37,760
And while

38076
10:15:37,760 --> 10:15:38,960
her courage was high,

38077
10:15:39,000 --> 10:15:40,200
she immediately said.

38078
10:15:40,760 --> 10:15:41,120
Mr.

38079
10:15:41,120 --> 10:15:42,060
Darcy,

38080
10:15:42,060 --> 10:15:42,660
I am a very

38081
10:15:42,660 --> 10:15:43,860
selfish creature

38082
10:15:44,060 --> 10:15:44,840
and for the sake

38083
10:15:44,840 --> 10:15:45,480
of giving relief

38084
10:15:45,480 --> 10:15:46,680
to my own feelings,

38085
10:15:46,740 --> 10:15:47,820
can not how much

38086
10:15:47,820 --> 10:15:49,020
I may be wounding yours.

38087
10:15:49,380 --> 10:15:50,520
I can no longer help

38088
10:15:50,520 --> 10:15:51,500
thanking you for your

38089
10:15:51,500 --> 10:15:52,920
an example of kindness

38090
10:15:52,920 --> 10:15:54,120
to my poor sister.

38091
10:15:54,480 --> 10:15:55,260
Ever since I.

38092
10:15:55,260 --> 10:15:56,160
Have known it,

38093
10:15:56,160 --> 10:15:57,560
I have been most anxious

38094
10:15:57,560 --> 10:15:58,440
to acknowledge to you

38095
10:15:58,440 --> 10:15:59,840
how gratefully I feel it

38096
10:16:00,360 --> 10:16:01,160
where it's known to the.

38097
10:16:01,160 --> 10:16:02,340
Rest of my family.

38098
10:16:02,340 --> 10:16:03,320
I should not have merely

38099
10:16:03,320 --> 10:16:03,740
my own.

38100
10:16:03,740 --> 10:16:05,060
Gratitude to express.

38101
10:16:05,880 --> 10:16:06,620
I am sorry.

38102
10:16:06,620 --> 10:16:07,820
Exceedingly sorry.

38103
10:16:07,880 --> 10:16:09,020
Replied Darcy,

38104
10:16:09,020 --> 10:16:10,140
in a tone of surprise

38105
10:16:10,140 --> 10:16:11,340
and emotion.

38106
10:16:11,540 --> 10:16:11,960
That you have

38107
10:16:11,960 --> 10:16:12,840
ever been informed

38108
10:16:12,840 --> 10:16:13,940
of what may

38109
10:16:13,940 --> 10:16:15,020
in a mistaken light

38110
10:16:15,020 --> 10:16:15,420
have given

38111
10:16:15,420 --> 10:16:16,620
you uneasiness.

38112
10:16:16,800 --> 10:16:17,840
I did not think Mrs.

38113
10:16:17,840 --> 10:16:18,540
Gardiner was so

38114
10:16:18,540 --> 10:16:19,520
little to be trusted.

38115
10:16:20,760 --> 10:16:21,480
You must

38116
10:16:21,480 --> 10:16:22,680
blame my Aunt

38117
10:16:22,760 --> 10:16:24,020
Lydia's thoughtlessness

38118
10:16:24,020 --> 10:16:24,920
first betrayed to me

38119
10:16:24,920 --> 10:16:25,400
that you had been

38120
10:16:25,400 --> 10:16:26,600
concerned in the matter.

38121
10:16:26,780 --> 10:16:27,380
And of course,

38122
10:16:27,380 --> 10:16:28,160
I could not rest

38123
10:16:28,160 --> 10:16:28,700
till I knew

38124
10:16:28,700 --> 10:16:29,900
the particulars.

38125
10:16:30,120 --> 10:16:31,740
Let me thank again

38126
10:16:31,740 --> 10:16:32,700
and again in the name

38127
10:16:32,700 --> 10:16:33,900
of all my family,

38128
10:16:34,080 --> 10:16:34,460
for that

38129
10:16:34,460 --> 10:16:35,600
generous compassion

38130
10:16:35,600 --> 10:16:36,320
which induced you

38131
10:16:36,320 --> 10:16:37,520
to take so much trouble

38132
10:16:37,680 --> 10:16:38,060
and bear

38133
10:16:38,060 --> 10:16:39,360
so many mortification

38134
10:16:39,360 --> 10:16:39,900
for the sake of

38135
10:16:39,900 --> 10:16:41,100
discovering them.

38136
10:16:41,400 --> 10:16:42,680
If you will thank me.

38137
10:16:43,260 --> 10:16:44,460
He replied.

38138
10:16:44,760 --> 10:16:45,200
Let it be

38139
10:16:45,200 --> 10:16:46,400
for yourself alone

38140
10:16:46,640 --> 10:16:47,220
that the wish

38141
10:16:47,220 --> 10:16:48,080
of giving happiness

38142
10:16:48,080 --> 10:16:49,440
to you might add force

38143
10:16:49,440 --> 10:16:50,640
to the other inducements

38144
10:16:50,760 --> 10:16:51,620
led me on.

38145
10:16:51,620 --> 10:16:52,140
I shall not

38146
10:16:52,140 --> 10:16:53,340
attempt to deny,

38147
10:16:53,600 --> 10:16:54,660
but your family owe me

38148
10:16:54,660 --> 10:16:55,320
nothing

38149
10:16:55,320 --> 10:16:56,520
much as I respect them.

38150
10:16:56,520 --> 10:16:57,020
I believe

38151
10:16:57,020 --> 10:16:58,220
I thought only of you.

38152
10:16:59,640 --> 10:17:00,740
Elizabeth Was too much

38153
10:17:00,740 --> 10:17:01,220
embarrassed

38154
10:17:01,220 --> 10:17:02,280
to say a word.

38155
10:17:02,280 --> 10:17:03,440
After a short pause,

38156
10:17:03,440 --> 10:17:04,640
her companion added.

38157
10:17:05,180 --> 10:17:06,240
You are too generous

38158
10:17:06,240 --> 10:17:07,440
to trifle with me.

38159
10:17:07,560 --> 10:17:08,340
If your feelings

38160
10:17:08,340 --> 10:17:08,840
are still what

38161
10:17:08,840 --> 10:17:10,040
they were last April,

38162
10:17:10,040 --> 10:17:11,240
tell me so at once.

38163
10:17:11,780 --> 10:17:12,440
My affections

38164
10:17:12,440 --> 10:17:12,860
and wishes

38165
10:17:12,860 --> 10:17:14,000
are unchanged.

38166
10:17:14,000 --> 10:17:15,200
But one word from you

38167
10:17:15,500 --> 10:17:16,320
will silence me on

38168
10:17:16,320 --> 10:17:17,240
this subject forever.

38169
10:17:18,320 --> 10:17:19,340
Elizabeth Feeling

38170
10:17:19,340 --> 10:17:19,700
all the

38171
10:17:19,700 --> 10:17:20,160
more than

38172
10:17:20,160 --> 10:17:21,180
common awkwardness

38173
10:17:21,180 --> 10:17:21,900
and anxiety

38174
10:17:21,900 --> 10:17:23,300
of a situation now

38175
10:17:23,300 --> 10:17:24,500
forced herself to speak

38176
10:17:24,860 --> 10:17:26,060
and immediately, though

38177
10:17:26,060 --> 10:17:27,260
not very fluently,

38178
10:17:27,360 --> 10:17:28,520
gave him to understand

38179
10:17:28,520 --> 10:17:29,240
that her sentiments

38180
10:17:29,240 --> 10:17:29,840
had undergone

38181
10:17:29,840 --> 10:17:31,080
so materially change

38182
10:17:31,260 --> 10:17:32,040
since the period

38183
10:17:32,040 --> 10:17:33,140
to which he alluded.

38184
10:17:33,140 --> 10:17:34,260
As to make her receive

38185
10:17:34,260 --> 10:17:34,980
with gratitude

38186
10:17:34,980 --> 10:17:35,540
and pleasure

38187
10:17:35,540 --> 10:17:36,780
his present assurances.

38188
10:17:37,280 --> 10:17:38,000
The happiness

38189
10:17:38,000 --> 10:17:38,420
which this

38190
10:17:38,420 --> 10:17:39,380
reply produced,

38191
10:17:39,380 --> 10:17:40,040
such as he had

38192
10:17:40,040 --> 10:17:40,740
probably never

38193
10:17:40,740 --> 10:17:41,760
felt before,

38194
10:17:41,760 --> 10:17:42,900
and he expressed himself

38195
10:17:42,900 --> 10:17:43,640
on the occasion

38196
10:17:43,640 --> 10:17:44,360
as sensibly

38197
10:17:44,360 --> 10:17:45,920
and as warmly as a man

38198
10:17:45,920 --> 10:17:46,760
violently in love

38199
10:17:46,760 --> 10:17:47,960
can be supposed to do.

38200
10:17:48,300 --> 10:17:49,320
Had Elizabeth been able

38201
10:17:49,320 --> 10:17:50,520
to encounter his eye,

38202
10:17:50,660 --> 10:17:51,440
she might have seen

38203
10:17:51,440 --> 10:17:52,520
how well the expression

38204
10:17:52,520 --> 10:17:53,580
of heartfelt delight

38205
10:17:53,580 --> 10:17:54,240
diffused over

38206
10:17:54,240 --> 10:17:55,640
his face became him.

38207
10:17:56,060 --> 10:17:56,520
But though.

38208
10:17:56,520 --> 10:17:57,600
She could not look,

38209
10:17:57,600 --> 10:17:58,680
she could listen.

38210
10:17:58,680 --> 10:17:58,880
And.

38211
10:17:58,880 --> 10:18:00,080
He told her of feelings,

38212
10:18:00,300 --> 10:18:00,660
which, in

38213
10:18:00,660 --> 10:18:01,200
proving of

38214
10:18:01,200 --> 10:18:01,860
what importance

38215
10:18:01,860 --> 10:18:02,900
she was to him,

38216
10:18:02,900 --> 10:18:03,900
made his affection

38217
10:18:03,900 --> 10:18:04,680
every moment

38218
10:18:04,680 --> 10:18:05,880
more valuable.

38219
10:18:06,320 --> 10:18:07,260
They walked on

38220
10:18:07,260 --> 10:18:08,100
without knowing

38221
10:18:08,100 --> 10:18:09,300
in what direction.

38222
10:18:09,380 --> 10:18:10,220
There was too much

38223
10:18:10,220 --> 10:18:11,460
to be thought and felt

38224
10:18:11,460 --> 10:18:12,860
and said for attention

38225
10:18:12,860 --> 10:18:14,060
to any other objects.

38226
10:18:14,520 --> 10:18:15,320
She soon learned

38227
10:18:15,320 --> 10:18:16,200
that they were indebted

38228
10:18:16,200 --> 10:18:16,880
for their present

38229
10:18:16,880 --> 10:18:17,760
good understanding

38230
10:18:17,760 --> 10:18:18,380
to the efforts

38231
10:18:18,380 --> 10:18:19,220
of his aunt,

38232
10:18:19,220 --> 10:18:20,280
who did call on him

38233
10:18:20,280 --> 10:18:20,860
in her return

38234
10:18:20,860 --> 10:18:21,680
through London,

38235
10:18:21,680 --> 10:18:22,160
and there

38236
10:18:22,160 --> 10:18:22,920
relate her journey

38237
10:18:22,920 --> 10:18:23,780
to long born.

38238
10:18:23,780 --> 10:18:24,680
Its motive

38239
10:18:24,680 --> 10:18:25,560
and the substance

38240
10:18:25,560 --> 10:18:26,400
of her conversation

38241
10:18:26,400 --> 10:18:27,380
with Elizabeth.

38242
10:18:27,380 --> 10:18:28,500
Dwelling emphatically

38243
10:18:28,500 --> 10:18:29,520
on expression

38244
10:18:29,520 --> 10:18:30,080
of the latter,

38245
10:18:30,080 --> 10:18:31,460
which in her Ladyship

38246
10:18:31,520 --> 10:18:32,460
apprehension

38247
10:18:32,460 --> 10:18:33,600
particularly denoted her

38248
10:18:33,600 --> 10:18:34,260
perverse ness

38249
10:18:34,260 --> 10:18:35,420
and assurance

38250
10:18:35,420 --> 10:18:36,120
in the belief

38251
10:18:36,120 --> 10:18:36,900
that such a relation

38252
10:18:36,900 --> 10:18:37,440
must assist

38253
10:18:37,440 --> 10:18:38,040
her endeavors

38254
10:18:38,040 --> 10:18:39,020
to obtain that promise

38255
10:18:39,020 --> 10:18:39,800
from her nephew,

38256
10:18:39,800 --> 10:18:41,000
which she had refused

38257
10:18:41,000 --> 10:18:42,000
to give.

38258
10:18:42,000 --> 10:18:42,860
But unluckily

38259
10:18:42,860 --> 10:18:43,940
for her Ladyship,

38260
10:18:43,940 --> 10:18:44,580
its effect

38261
10:18:44,580 --> 10:18:44,900
had been

38262
10:18:44,900 --> 10:18:46,500
exactly contrariwise.

38263
10:18:46,860 --> 10:18:48,020
It taught me to hope.

38264
10:18:48,020 --> 10:18:48,800
Said he.

38265
10:18:48,800 --> 10:18:50,120
As I had scarcely ever

38266
10:18:50,120 --> 10:18:50,940
allowed myself

38267
10:18:50,940 --> 10:18:51,740
to hope before

38268
10:18:52,740 --> 10:18:53,120
I knew

38269
10:18:53,120 --> 10:18:53,540
enough of

38270
10:18:53,540 --> 10:18:54,360
your disposition

38271
10:18:54,360 --> 10:18:55,560
to be certain

38272
10:18:55,680 --> 10:18:56,400
that had you

38273
10:18:56,400 --> 10:18:57,600
been absolutely,

38274
10:18:57,600 --> 10:18:58,880
irrevocably decided

38275
10:18:58,880 --> 10:18:59,720
against me,

38276
10:18:59,720 --> 10:19:00,140
you would have

38277
10:19:00,140 --> 10:19:00,740
acknowledged it

38278
10:19:00,740 --> 10:19:01,940
to Lady Catherine,

38279
10:19:02,000 --> 10:19:03,200
frankly and openly.

38280
10:19:05,460 --> 10:19:06,380
Elizabeth colored

38281
10:19:06,380 --> 10:19:06,900
and laughed

38282
10:19:06,900 --> 10:19:08,100
as she replied.

38283
10:19:08,120 --> 10:19:08,960
Yes.

38284
10:19:08,960 --> 10:19:09,360
You know

38285
10:19:09,360 --> 10:19:10,400
enough of my frankness

38286
10:19:10,400 --> 10:19:10,820
to believe me

38287
10:19:10,820 --> 10:19:12,020
capable of that

38288
10:19:12,440 --> 10:19:13,680
after abusing you so

38289
10:19:13,680 --> 10:19:14,880
abominably to your face.

38290
10:19:15,080 --> 10:19:15,540
I could have

38291
10:19:15,540 --> 10:19:16,260
no scruple in

38292
10:19:16,260 --> 10:19:16,700
abusing you

38293
10:19:16,700 --> 10:19:17,900
to all your relations.

38294
10:19:18,920 --> 10:19:19,940
What did you say of me

38295
10:19:19,940 --> 10:19:21,140
that I did not deserve?

38296
10:19:22,380 --> 10:19:22,820
For though

38297
10:19:22,820 --> 10:19:23,720
your accusations were

38298
10:19:23,720 --> 10:19:24,360
ill founded,

38299
10:19:24,360 --> 10:19:24,740
Formed on

38300
10:19:24,740 --> 10:19:25,940
mistaken premises,

38301
10:19:27,260 --> 10:19:28,260
my behavior to you

38302
10:19:28,260 --> 10:19:28,740
at the time

38303
10:19:28,740 --> 10:19:29,300
had merited

38304
10:19:29,300 --> 10:19:30,560
the severest reproof.

38305
10:19:31,340 --> 10:19:32,540
It was unpardonable.

38306
10:19:33,080 --> 10:19:34,080
I cannot think of it

38307
10:19:34,080 --> 10:19:35,280
without abhorrence.

38308
10:19:36,300 --> 10:19:37,200
We will not quarrel

38309
10:19:37,200 --> 10:19:37,620
for the greater

38310
10:19:37,620 --> 10:19:38,400
shame of blame.

38311
10:19:38,400 --> 10:19:38,760
Next.

38312
10:19:38,760 --> 10:19:39,740
That evening,

38313
10:19:39,740 --> 10:19:40,820
said Elizabeth.

38314
10:19:40,820 --> 10:19:42,260
The conduct of neither,

38315
10:19:42,260 --> 10:19:42,960
if strictly.

38316
10:19:42,960 --> 10:19:43,680
Examined.

38317
10:19:43,680 --> 10:19:44,220
Will be a.

38318
10:19:45,260 --> 10:19:46,260
But since then,

38319
10:19:46,260 --> 10:19:46,920
we have both,

38320
10:19:46,920 --> 10:19:47,340
I hope,

38321
10:19:47,340 --> 10:19:48,780
improved in civility.

38322
10:19:49,620 --> 10:19:50,760
I cannot be so easily

38323
10:19:50,760 --> 10:19:52,040
reconciled to myself.

38324
10:19:53,220 --> 10:19:54,000
The recollection,

38325
10:19:54,000 --> 10:19:54,260
what I

38326
10:19:54,260 --> 10:19:55,620
then said of my conduct,

38327
10:19:55,620 --> 10:19:56,820
my manners,

38328
10:19:57,200 --> 10:19:57,980
my expressions

38329
10:19:57,980 --> 10:19:59,180
during the whole of it

38330
10:19:59,180 --> 10:20:00,120
is now and has been

38331
10:20:00,120 --> 10:20:01,320
many months

38332
10:20:01,480 --> 10:20:02,460
and expressively

38333
10:20:02,460 --> 10:20:03,660
painful to me.

38334
10:20:05,100 --> 10:20:05,780
Your reproof

38335
10:20:05,780 --> 10:20:06,480
so well applied.

38336
10:20:06,480 --> 10:20:07,680
I shall never forget,

38337
10:20:09,440 --> 10:20:10,100
had you behaved

38338
10:20:10,100 --> 10:20:10,860
in a more gentleman

38339
10:20:10,860 --> 10:20:12,060
like manner.

38340
10:20:12,780 --> 10:20:13,980
Those were your words,

38341
10:20:15,140 --> 10:20:15,780
you know. Not.

38342
10:20:15,780 --> 10:20:16,020
You can

38343
10:20:16,020 --> 10:20:16,860
scarcely conceive

38344
10:20:16,860 --> 10:20:17,360
how they have

38345
10:20:17,360 --> 10:20:18,560
tortured me,

38346
10:20:19,700 --> 10:20:19,880
though

38347
10:20:19,880 --> 10:20:20,600
it was some time,

38348
10:20:20,600 --> 10:20:21,480
I confess, before

38349
10:20:21,480 --> 10:20:22,380
I was reasonable enough

38350
10:20:22,380 --> 10:20:23,580
to allow that justice.

38351
10:20:26,100 --> 10:20:27,260
I was certainly very far

38352
10:20:27,260 --> 10:20:28,160
from expecting them

38353
10:20:28,160 --> 10:20:28,940
to make so strong

38354
10:20:28,940 --> 10:20:30,140
an impression.

38355
10:20:30,540 --> 10:20:31,040
I had not the

38356
10:20:31,040 --> 10:20:31,820
smallest idea

38357
10:20:31,820 --> 10:20:32,360
of their being

38358
10:20:32,360 --> 10:20:33,660
ever felt in such a way.

38359
10:20:34,520 --> 10:20:35,820
I can easily believe it.

38360
10:20:36,300 --> 10:20:36,860
You thought me

38361
10:20:36,860 --> 10:20:37,400
then, devoid

38362
10:20:37,400 --> 10:20:38,660
of every proper feeling.

38363
10:20:38,880 --> 10:20:40,080
I'm sure you did.

38364
10:20:40,200 --> 10:20:40,640
The tone of

38365
10:20:40,640 --> 10:20:41,340
your countenance.

38366
10:20:41,340 --> 10:20:42,540
I shall never forget,

38367
10:20:42,740 --> 10:20:43,380
as you said,

38368
10:20:43,380 --> 10:20:44,040
that I could not have

38369
10:20:44,040 --> 10:20:44,660
addressed you

38370
10:20:44,660 --> 10:20:45,600
any possible way

38371
10:20:45,600 --> 10:20:45,860
that would

38372
10:20:45,860 --> 10:20:47,060
induce you to accept me.

38373
10:20:48,900 --> 10:20:50,040
Oh, do not repeat

38374
10:20:50,040 --> 10:20:51,240
what I then said.

38375
10:20:51,780 --> 10:20:52,640
These recollections

38376
10:20:52,640 --> 10:20:53,840
will not do at all.

38377
10:20:53,960 --> 10:20:54,920
I assure you that

38378
10:20:54,920 --> 10:20:55,500
I have long

38379
10:20:55,500 --> 10:20:56,540
been most heartily

38380
10:20:56,540 --> 10:20:57,740
ashamed of it.

38381
10:20:57,800 --> 10:20:59,060
D'Arcy mentioned letter.

38382
10:20:59,480 --> 10:21:00,300
Did it?

38383
10:21:00,300 --> 10:21:01,760
Said he did it soon.

38384
10:21:01,760 --> 10:21:02,300
Make you think

38385
10:21:02,300 --> 10:21:03,500
better of me.

38386
10:21:03,740 --> 10:21:04,800
Did you, on reading it,

38387
10:21:04,800 --> 10:21:05,480
give any credit

38388
10:21:05,480 --> 10:21:06,680
to its contents?

38389
10:21:09,380 --> 10:21:10,160
She explained

38390
10:21:10,160 --> 10:21:10,940
what its effect on

38391
10:21:10,940 --> 10:21:11,720
her had been

38392
10:21:11,720 --> 10:21:12,660
and how gradually

38393
10:21:12,660 --> 10:21:13,280
all her former

38394
10:21:13,280 --> 10:21:14,000
prejudices had

38395
10:21:14,000 --> 10:21:15,200
been removed.

38396
10:21:15,420 --> 10:21:16,760
I knew, said he,

38397
10:21:17,400 --> 10:21:17,760
that what

38398
10:21:17,760 --> 10:21:19,040
I must give you pain,

38399
10:21:19,040 --> 10:21:20,240
but it was necessary.

38400
10:21:20,660 --> 10:21:21,020
I hope

38401
10:21:21,020 --> 10:21:21,680
you have destroyed

38402
10:21:21,680 --> 10:21:22,340
the letter.

38403
10:21:22,340 --> 10:21:23,240
There was one part,

38404
10:21:23,240 --> 10:21:23,940
especially the

38405
10:21:23,940 --> 10:21:24,660
opening of it,

38406
10:21:24,660 --> 10:21:25,440
which I should dread.

38407
10:21:25,440 --> 10:21:26,280
Your having the power

38408
10:21:26,280 --> 10:21:27,480
of reading again.

38409
10:21:27,680 --> 10:21:28,380
I can remember

38410
10:21:28,380 --> 10:21:29,540
some expressions

38411
10:21:29,540 --> 10:21:30,560
which might justly make

38412
10:21:30,560 --> 10:21:31,280
you hate me.

38413
10:21:32,240 --> 10:21:32,760
The latter

38414
10:21:32,760 --> 10:21:33,500
shall certainly

38415
10:21:33,500 --> 10:21:34,020
be burnt.

38416
10:21:34,020 --> 10:21:34,580
If you believe it

38417
10:21:34,580 --> 10:21:34,980
essential

38418
10:21:34,980 --> 10:21:35,640
to the preservation

38419
10:21:35,640 --> 10:21:36,840
of my. Regard.

38420
10:21:36,900 --> 10:21:37,260
But there

38421
10:21:37,260 --> 10:21:38,100
we have both reason

38422
10:21:38,100 --> 10:21:39,020
to think my opinions

38423
10:21:39,020 --> 10:21:39,720
not entirely

38424
10:21:39,720 --> 10:21:40,740
unalterable.

38425
10:21:40,740 --> 10:21:41,360
They are not,

38426
10:21:41,360 --> 10:21:42,660
I hope, quite so easily.

38427
10:21:42,660 --> 10:21:43,500
Changed as that.

38428
10:21:43,500 --> 10:21:44,520
Implies.

38429
10:21:44,520 --> 10:21:45,020
When I wrote

38430
10:21:45,020 --> 10:21:45,900
that letter.

38431
10:21:45,900 --> 10:21:46,940
Replied Darcy.

38432
10:21:46,940 --> 10:21:47,180
I.

38433
10:21:47,180 --> 10:21:47,900
Believed myself

38434
10:21:47,900 --> 10:21:49,440
perfectly calm and cool,

38435
10:21:49,800 --> 10:21:50,960
but I am since convinced

38436
10:21:50,960 --> 10:21:51,560
that it was written

38437
10:21:51,560 --> 10:21:52,220
in a dreadful

38438
10:21:52,220 --> 10:21:53,420
bitterness of spirit.

38439
10:21:53,960 --> 10:21:55,320
The letter perhaps began

38440
10:21:55,320 --> 10:21:56,120
in bitterness,

38441
10:21:56,120 --> 10:21:57,000
but it did not end.

38442
10:21:57,000 --> 10:21:57,800
So

38443
10:21:57,800 --> 10:21:58,520
the adieu is

38444
10:21:58,520 --> 10:21:59,720
charity itself.

38445
10:22:00,120 --> 10:22:00,800
But think no

38446
10:22:00,800 --> 10:22:01,880
more of the letter.

38447
10:22:01,880 --> 10:22:02,460
The feelings

38448
10:22:02,460 --> 10:22:03,020
of the person

38449
10:22:03,020 --> 10:22:03,720
who wrote and.

38450
10:22:03,720 --> 10:22:04,160
The person

38451
10:22:04,160 --> 10:22:05,220
who received it

38452
10:22:05,220 --> 10:22:06,420
are now so widely.

38453
10:22:06,720 --> 10:22:07,200
From what they.

38454
10:22:07,200 --> 10:22:08,040
Then were

38455
10:22:08,040 --> 10:22:08,580
that every

38456
10:22:08,580 --> 10:22:09,860
unpleasant circumstance

38457
10:22:09,860 --> 10:22:10,260
attending

38458
10:22:10,260 --> 10:22:10,620
it ought

38459
10:22:10,620 --> 10:22:11,820
to be forgotten.

38460
10:22:12,060 --> 10:22:12,800
You must learn

38461
10:22:12,800 --> 10:22:14,000
some of my philosophy.

38462
10:22:14,360 --> 10:22:15,780
Think only of the past

38463
10:22:15,780 --> 10:22:16,680
as remembrance

38464
10:22:16,680 --> 10:22:17,780
gives you pleasure.

38465
10:22:17,780 --> 10:22:19,140
I cannot give you credit

38466
10:22:19,140 --> 10:22:20,120
for any philosophy

38467
10:22:20,120 --> 10:22:21,120
of the kind.

38468
10:22:21,120 --> 10:22:22,080
Your retrospection

38469
10:22:22,080 --> 10:22:23,180
must be so totally void

38470
10:22:23,180 --> 10:22:24,180
of reproach

38471
10:22:24,180 --> 10:22:25,020
that the contentment

38472
10:22:25,020 --> 10:22:25,800
arising from

38473
10:22:25,800 --> 10:22:27,000
is not a philosophy.

38474
10:22:27,120 --> 10:22:28,340
But what is much

38475
10:22:28,340 --> 10:22:29,540
better of ignorance?

38476
10:22:29,660 --> 10:22:30,860
But with me,

38477
10:22:30,920 --> 10:22:32,120
it is not so

38478
10:22:32,780 --> 10:22:33,180
painful.

38479
10:22:33,180 --> 10:22:33,720
Recollections

38480
10:22:33,720 --> 10:22:34,340
will intrude,

38481
10:22:34,340 --> 10:22:35,460
which cannot which

38482
10:22:35,460 --> 10:22:36,360
not to be repelled.

38483
10:22:37,400 --> 10:22:37,920
I have been a

38484
10:22:37,920 --> 10:22:38,660
selfish being

38485
10:22:38,660 --> 10:22:40,140
all my life in practice,

38486
10:22:40,560 --> 10:22:41,760
though not in principle.

38487
10:22:42,380 --> 10:22:43,500
As a child, I was taught

38488
10:22:43,500 --> 10:22:44,700
what was right.

38489
10:22:45,060 --> 10:22:45,620
But I was not

38490
10:22:45,620 --> 10:22:46,440
taught to correct

38491
10:22:46,440 --> 10:22:47,640
my temper.

38492
10:22:47,880 --> 10:22:48,360
I was given

38493
10:22:48,360 --> 10:22:49,560
good principles,

38494
10:22:49,760 --> 10:22:50,660
but left to follow them

38495
10:22:50,660 --> 10:22:51,860
in pride and conceit.

38496
10:22:52,920 --> 10:22:53,660
Unfortunately,

38497
10:22:53,660 --> 10:22:54,740
and only son.

38498
10:22:54,740 --> 10:22:55,500
For many years,

38499
10:22:55,500 --> 10:22:56,700
an only child.

38500
10:22:56,720 --> 10:22:57,380
I was spoiled

38501
10:22:57,380 --> 10:22:58,220
by my parents,

38502
10:22:58,220 --> 10:22:59,100
who though

38503
10:22:59,100 --> 10:23:00,300
good themselves.

38504
10:23:00,320 --> 10:23:01,580
My father, particularly.

38505
10:23:01,920 --> 10:23:03,000
All that was benevolent

38506
10:23:03,000 --> 10:23:04,460
and amiable, allowed,

38507
10:23:05,540 --> 10:23:06,320
almost taught me

38508
10:23:06,320 --> 10:23:07,100
to be selfish

38509
10:23:07,100 --> 10:23:08,300
and overbearing,

38510
10:23:08,300 --> 10:23:09,420
to care for none beyond

38511
10:23:09,420 --> 10:23:10,640
my own family circle,

38512
10:23:10,860 --> 10:23:11,300
to think

38513
10:23:11,300 --> 10:23:11,940
meanly of

38514
10:23:11,940 --> 10:23:12,440
all the rest

38515
10:23:12,440 --> 10:23:13,160
of the world,

38516
10:23:13,160 --> 10:23:13,680
to wish

38517
10:23:13,680 --> 10:23:14,900
at least to think meanly

38518
10:23:14,900 --> 10:23:15,660
of their sense

38519
10:23:15,660 --> 10:23:16,520
and worth.

38520
10:23:16,520 --> 10:23:17,720
Compared with my own

38521
10:23:18,660 --> 10:23:19,440
such, I was

38522
10:23:19,440 --> 10:23:20,780
from 8 to 8 and 20

38523
10:23:22,260 --> 10:23:22,740
and such.

38524
10:23:22,740 --> 10:23:23,580
I might still have been,

38525
10:23:23,580 --> 10:23:24,780
but for you

38526
10:23:25,340 --> 10:23:26,000
dearest,

38527
10:23:26,000 --> 10:23:27,200
loveliest Elizabeth.

38528
10:23:28,320 --> 10:23:29,540
What do I not owe you?

38529
10:23:30,560 --> 10:23:31,460
You taught me a lesson.

38530
10:23:31,460 --> 10:23:32,540
Hard, indeed, at first,

38531
10:23:32,540 --> 10:23:33,840
but most advantageous

38532
10:23:34,460 --> 10:23:35,280
by you.

38533
10:23:35,280 --> 10:23:36,560
I was properly humbled.

38534
10:23:38,000 --> 10:23:38,640
I came to you

38535
10:23:38,640 --> 10:23:39,260
without a doubt

38536
10:23:39,260 --> 10:23:40,460
of my reception.

38537
10:23:41,660 --> 10:23:42,180
You showed me

38538
10:23:42,180 --> 10:23:42,960
how insufficient

38539
10:23:42,960 --> 10:23:44,060
were all my pretensions.

38540
10:23:44,060 --> 10:23:44,300
Please.

38541
10:23:44,300 --> 10:23:44,720
A woman

38542
10:23:44,720 --> 10:23:45,920
worthy of being pleased.

38543
10:23:48,900 --> 10:23:49,400
Had you

38544
10:23:49,400 --> 10:23:50,420
then persuaded yourself

38545
10:23:50,420 --> 10:23:51,620
that I should?

38546
10:23:51,780 --> 10:23:52,980
Indeed I had.

38547
10:23:53,000 --> 10:23:53,420
What will you

38548
10:23:53,420 --> 10:23:54,620
think of my vanity?

38549
10:23:54,680 --> 10:23:55,280
I believed you

38550
10:23:55,280 --> 10:23:56,760
to be wishing, expecting

38551
10:23:56,760 --> 10:23:57,960
my addresses.

38552
10:23:59,480 --> 10:24:00,540
My manners must have.

38553
10:24:00,540 --> 10:24:01,580
Been in fault.

38554
10:24:01,580 --> 10:24:02,640
But not intentionally,

38555
10:24:02,640 --> 10:24:03,840
I assure you.

38556
10:24:03,860 --> 10:24:04,680
I never meant to

38557
10:24:04,680 --> 10:24:05,540
deceive you.

38558
10:24:05,540 --> 10:24:06,360
But my spirits

38559
10:24:06,360 --> 10:24:07,560
might often be wrong.

38560
10:24:08,040 --> 10:24:08,240
How?

38561
10:24:08,240 --> 10:24:09,200
You must have hated me

38562
10:24:09,200 --> 10:24:10,400
after that evening.

38563
10:24:11,220 --> 10:24:12,320
Hate you?

38564
10:24:12,320 --> 10:24:13,080
I was angry,

38565
10:24:13,080 --> 10:24:14,000
perhaps at first,

38566
10:24:14,000 --> 10:24:15,300
but my anger soon began

38567
10:24:15,300 --> 10:24:15,720
to take a

38568
10:24:15,720 --> 10:24:16,620
proper direction.

38569
10:24:18,080 --> 10:24:18,380
I was

38570
10:24:18,380 --> 10:24:19,640
almost afraid of asking

38571
10:24:19,640 --> 10:24:20,640
what he thought of me

38572
10:24:20,640 --> 10:24:21,120
when we met

38573
10:24:21,120 --> 10:24:22,320
at Pemberley.

38574
10:24:22,320 --> 10:24:23,180
You blamed me

38575
10:24:23,180 --> 10:24:23,960
for coming?

38576
10:24:23,960 --> 10:24:25,140
No, indeed.

38577
10:24:25,140 --> 10:24:26,060
I felt nothing but

38578
10:24:26,060 --> 10:24:27,260
surprise.

38579
10:24:27,480 --> 10:24:28,620
Your surprise could not.

38580
10:24:28,620 --> 10:24:29,520
Be greater than mine

38581
10:24:29,520 --> 10:24:30,260
in being noticed.

38582
10:24:30,260 --> 10:24:31,140
By you.

38583
10:24:31,140 --> 10:24:32,160
My conscience told me

38584
10:24:32,160 --> 10:24:32,660
that I deserved

38585
10:24:32,660 --> 10:24:33,320
no extraordinary

38586
10:24:33,320 --> 10:24:34,280
politeness.

38587
10:24:34,280 --> 10:24:35,040
And I confess

38588
10:24:35,040 --> 10:24:35,820
that I did not expect

38589
10:24:35,820 --> 10:24:36,240
to receive

38590
10:24:36,240 --> 10:24:37,440
more than my due.

38591
10:24:37,940 --> 10:24:38,960
My object then.

38592
10:24:38,960 --> 10:24:40,040
Replied Darcy.

38593
10:24:40,040 --> 10:24:40,880
Was to show you

38594
10:24:40,880 --> 10:24:41,880
by every civility

38595
10:24:41,880 --> 10:24:42,720
in my power

38596
10:24:42,720 --> 10:24:43,860
that I was not so mean

38597
10:24:43,860 --> 10:24:45,140
as to resent the past.

38598
10:24:45,440 --> 10:24:46,620
And I hoped to obtain

38599
10:24:46,620 --> 10:24:47,700
forgiveness to lessen

38600
10:24:47,700 --> 10:24:48,900
your ill opinion

38601
10:24:49,160 --> 10:24:49,740
by letting

38602
10:24:49,740 --> 10:24:50,280
you see that

38603
10:24:50,280 --> 10:24:51,000
your reproof

38604
10:24:51,000 --> 10:24:52,200
had been attended to.

38605
10:24:53,700 --> 10:24:54,620
How soon any other

38606
10:24:54,620 --> 10:24:54,920
wishes

38607
10:24:54,920 --> 10:24:55,860
introduce themselves?

38608
10:24:55,860 --> 10:24:57,060
I can hardly tell.

38609
10:24:58,040 --> 10:24:58,700
But I believe

38610
10:24:58,700 --> 10:24:59,400
in about half an

38611
10:24:59,400 --> 10:25:00,020
hour after I

38612
10:25:00,020 --> 10:25:00,660
had seen you.

38613
10:25:01,800 --> 10:25:02,220
He then

38614
10:25:02,220 --> 10:25:03,420
told her of Georgina's

38615
10:25:03,420 --> 10:25:03,800
delight

38616
10:25:03,800 --> 10:25:04,820
in her acquaintance

38617
10:25:04,820 --> 10:25:05,220
and of her

38618
10:25:05,220 --> 10:25:06,120
disappointment at,

38619
10:25:06,120 --> 10:25:07,320
its sudden interruption,

38620
10:25:07,500 --> 10:25:08,460
which naturally leading

38621
10:25:08,460 --> 10:25:08,960
to the cause

38622
10:25:08,960 --> 10:25:10,080
of that interruption.

38623
10:25:10,080 --> 10:25:10,860
She soon learned

38624
10:25:10,860 --> 10:25:11,640
that his resolution

38625
10:25:11,640 --> 10:25:12,240
of following her

38626
10:25:12,240 --> 10:25:12,920
from Derbyshire

38627
10:25:12,920 --> 10:25:14,120
in quest of her sister

38628
10:25:14,120 --> 10:25:14,880
had been formed

38629
10:25:14,880 --> 10:25:15,480
before he quit

38630
10:25:15,480 --> 10:25:16,200
at the end,

38631
10:25:16,200 --> 10:25:17,220
and that his gravity

38632
10:25:17,220 --> 10:25:18,000
and thoughtfulness

38633
10:25:18,000 --> 10:25:18,840
there had arisen from

38634
10:25:18,840 --> 10:25:19,940
no other struggles

38635
10:25:19,940 --> 10:25:21,060
than what such a purpose

38636
10:25:21,060 --> 10:25:22,260
must comprehend.

38637
10:25:22,560 --> 10:25:23,400
She expressed her

38638
10:25:23,400 --> 10:25:24,540
gratitude again,

38639
10:25:24,540 --> 10:25:25,520
but it was too painful

38640
10:25:25,520 --> 10:25:26,000
a subject

38641
10:25:26,000 --> 10:25:26,820
to each to be dwelt

38642
10:25:26,820 --> 10:25:28,020
on further.

38643
10:25:28,100 --> 10:25:28,800
After walking

38644
10:25:28,800 --> 10:25:29,540
several miles

38645
10:25:29,540 --> 10:25:30,680
in a leisurely manner

38646
10:25:30,680 --> 10:25:31,440
and too busy

38647
10:25:31,440 --> 10:25:31,700
to know

38648
10:25:31,700 --> 10:25:32,880
anything about it,

38649
10:25:32,880 --> 10:25:33,980
they found at last

38650
10:25:33,980 --> 10:25:34,620
on examining

38651
10:25:34,620 --> 10:25:35,480
their watches

38652
10:25:35,480 --> 10:25:36,200
that it was time

38653
10:25:36,200 --> 10:25:37,400
to be at home.

38654
10:25:37,860 --> 10:25:39,060
What could become of Mr.

38655
10:25:39,060 --> 10:25:40,260
Bingley and Jane.

38656
10:25:40,460 --> 10:25:41,120
Was a wonder

38657
10:25:41,120 --> 10:25:41,700
which introduced

38658
10:25:41,700 --> 10:25:42,240
the discussion

38659
10:25:42,240 --> 10:25:43,440
of their affairs.

38660
10:25:43,460 --> 10:25:44,580
Darcy was delighted

38661
10:25:44,580 --> 10:25:45,680
with their engagement.

38662
10:25:45,680 --> 10:25:46,700
His friend had given him

38663
10:25:46,700 --> 10:25:47,240
the earliest

38664
10:25:47,240 --> 10:25:48,440
information of it.

38665
10:25:49,040 --> 10:25:49,820
I must ask

38666
10:25:49,820 --> 10:25:50,060
whether you

38667
10:25:50,060 --> 10:25:51,120
were surprised,

38668
10:25:51,120 --> 10:25:52,260
said Elizabeth.

38669
10:25:52,260 --> 10:25:53,220
Not at all.

38670
10:25:53,220 --> 10:25:53,960
When I went away,

38671
10:25:53,960 --> 10:25:54,500
I felt that it

38672
10:25:54,500 --> 10:25:55,260
would soon happen.

38673
10:25:56,240 --> 10:25:56,760
That is to

38674
10:25:56,760 --> 10:25:57,780
say, you had

38675
10:25:57,780 --> 10:25:58,980
given your permission.

38676
10:25:59,220 --> 10:26:00,420
I guessed as much.

38677
10:26:00,980 --> 10:26:01,560
And though he

38678
10:26:01,560 --> 10:26:02,760
exclaimed at the time,

38679
10:26:02,900 --> 10:26:03,500
she found that

38680
10:26:03,500 --> 10:26:03,780
it had been

38681
10:26:03,780 --> 10:26:04,400
pretty much the.

38682
10:26:04,400 --> 10:26:05,600
Case.

38683
10:26:06,020 --> 10:26:06,780
On the evening

38684
10:26:06,780 --> 10:26:07,560
before my going

38685
10:26:07,560 --> 10:26:08,160
to London.

38686
10:26:08,160 --> 10:26:09,060
Said he.

38687
10:26:09,060 --> 10:26:10,020
I made a confession

38688
10:26:10,020 --> 10:26:11,220
to him,

38689
10:26:11,600 --> 10:26:12,300
which I believe

38690
10:26:12,300 --> 10:26:13,040
I ought to have made

38691
10:26:13,040 --> 10:26:14,240
long ago.

38692
10:26:15,600 --> 10:26:16,520
I told him of all

38693
10:26:16,520 --> 10:26:17,180
that had occurred

38694
10:26:17,180 --> 10:26:17,580
to make

38695
10:26:17,580 --> 10:26:18,740
my former interference

38696
10:26:18,740 --> 10:26:20,280
in his affairs absurd

38697
10:26:20,280 --> 10:26:21,480
and impertinent.

38698
10:26:22,520 --> 10:26:23,840
His surprise was great.

38699
10:26:24,060 --> 10:26:24,780
He Had never had

38700
10:26:24,780 --> 10:26:25,980
the slightest suspicion.

38701
10:26:26,460 --> 10:26:27,660
I told him, moreover,

38702
10:26:28,020 --> 10:26:28,980
that I believed myself

38703
10:26:28,980 --> 10:26:30,120
mistaken in supposing,

38704
10:26:30,120 --> 10:26:31,380
as I had done, that

38705
10:26:31,380 --> 10:26:31,920
your sister

38706
10:26:31,920 --> 10:26:33,120
was indifferent to him,

38707
10:26:33,440 --> 10:26:34,460
and as I could

38708
10:26:34,460 --> 10:26:35,100
perceive that

38709
10:26:35,100 --> 10:26:36,080
his attachment to her

38710
10:26:36,080 --> 10:26:37,140
was unabated.

38711
10:26:37,140 --> 10:26:38,120
I felt no doubt of

38712
10:26:38,120 --> 10:26:38,720
their happiness

38713
10:26:38,720 --> 10:26:39,140
together.

38714
10:26:40,320 --> 10:26:40,980
Elizabeth could

38715
10:26:40,980 --> 10:26:41,880
not help, smiling

38716
10:26:41,880 --> 10:26:42,780
at his easy manner

38717
10:26:42,780 --> 10:26:43,980
of directing his friend.

38718
10:26:44,660 --> 10:26:45,480
Did you speak from

38719
10:26:45,480 --> 10:26:46,620
your own observation?

38720
10:26:46,620 --> 10:26:47,520
Said she,

38721
10:26:47,520 --> 10:26:48,300
when you told him

38722
10:26:48,300 --> 10:26:48,900
that my sister

38723
10:26:48,900 --> 10:26:49,740
loved him,

38724
10:26:49,740 --> 10:26:50,300
or merely

38725
10:26:50,300 --> 10:26:51,380
for my information.

38726
10:26:51,380 --> 10:26:52,580
Last spring

38727
10:26:53,880 --> 10:26:55,080
from the former?

38728
10:26:55,200 --> 10:26:55,820
I had narrowly

38729
10:26:55,820 --> 10:26:56,400
observed her

38730
10:26:56,400 --> 10:26:57,360
during the two visits,

38731
10:26:57,360 --> 10:26:58,080
which I had lately

38732
10:26:58,080 --> 10:26:59,100
made her here,

38733
10:26:59,100 --> 10:26:59,960
and I was convinced

38734
10:26:59,960 --> 10:27:01,160
of her affection.

38735
10:27:02,240 --> 10:27:03,260
And your assurance.

38736
10:27:03,260 --> 10:27:03,860
It, I suppose,

38737
10:27:03,860 --> 10:27:04,500
carried immediate

38738
10:27:04,500 --> 10:27:05,700
conviction to him.

38739
10:27:06,140 --> 10:27:07,340
It did.

38740
10:27:07,400 --> 10:27:08,240
Bingley is most

38741
10:27:08,240 --> 10:27:09,440
unaffected, Li modest.

38742
10:27:09,900 --> 10:27:10,580
His diffidence

38743
10:27:10,580 --> 10:27:11,160
had prevented

38744
10:27:11,160 --> 10:27:11,820
his depending

38745
10:27:11,820 --> 10:27:12,960
on his own judgment,

38746
10:27:12,960 --> 10:27:14,160
so anxious a case.

38747
10:27:14,940 --> 10:27:16,160
But his reliance on mine

38748
10:27:16,160 --> 10:27:17,360
made everything easy.

38749
10:27:18,180 --> 10:27:18,920
I was obliged

38750
10:27:18,920 --> 10:27:20,120
to confess one thing,

38751
10:27:20,340 --> 10:27:21,180
which for a time

38752
10:27:21,180 --> 10:27:22,440
and not unjustly

38753
10:27:22,560 --> 10:27:23,720
offended him.

38754
10:27:23,720 --> 10:27:24,860
I could not allow myself

38755
10:27:24,860 --> 10:27:25,500
to conceal

38756
10:27:25,500 --> 10:27:26,180
that your sister

38757
10:27:26,180 --> 10:27:26,900
had been in town

38758
10:27:26,900 --> 10:27:27,500
three months

38759
10:27:27,500 --> 10:27:28,140
last winter.

38760
10:27:28,140 --> 10:27:29,340
That I had known it

38761
10:27:29,600 --> 10:27:30,600
and purposely kept

38762
10:27:30,600 --> 10:27:31,160
it from him.

38763
10:27:32,340 --> 10:27:33,540
He was angry.

38764
10:27:33,560 --> 10:27:34,440
But his anger,

38765
10:27:34,440 --> 10:27:35,580
I am persuaded,

38766
10:27:35,580 --> 10:27:36,600
lasted no longer

38767
10:27:36,600 --> 10:27:37,260
than he remained

38768
10:27:37,260 --> 10:27:37,920
in any doubt

38769
10:27:37,920 --> 10:27:38,480
of your sister's

38770
10:27:38,480 --> 10:27:39,620
sentiments.

38771
10:27:39,620 --> 10:27:40,340
He has heartily

38772
10:27:40,340 --> 10:27:41,540
forgiven me now.

38773
10:27:42,240 --> 10:27:43,140
Elizabeth longed

38774
10:27:43,140 --> 10:27:44,000
to observe that Mr.

38775
10:27:44,000 --> 10:27:45,000
Bingley had been a most

38776
10:27:45,000 --> 10:27:46,200
delightful friend,

38777
10:27:46,260 --> 10:27:47,580
so easily guided that

38778
10:27:47,580 --> 10:27:48,020
his worth

38779
10:27:48,020 --> 10:27:49,160
was invaluable.

38780
10:27:49,160 --> 10:27:50,360
But she checked herself.

38781
10:27:50,640 --> 10:27:51,240
She remembered

38782
10:27:51,240 --> 10:27:51,900
that he had yet

38783
10:27:51,900 --> 10:27:52,560
to learn to be

38784
10:27:52,560 --> 10:27:53,340
laughed at,

38785
10:27:53,340 --> 10:27:54,300
and it was rather too

38786
10:27:54,300 --> 10:27:55,500
early to begin

38787
10:27:55,560 --> 10:27:56,460
in anticipating

38788
10:27:56,460 --> 10:27:57,000
the happiness

38789
10:27:57,000 --> 10:27:57,680
of Bingley,

38790
10:27:57,680 --> 10:27:58,340
which of course

38791
10:27:58,340 --> 10:27:59,160
was to be inferior

38792
10:27:59,160 --> 10:28:00,300
only to his own.

38793
10:28:00,300 --> 10:28:00,840
He continued

38794
10:28:00,840 --> 10:28:01,640
the conversation

38795
10:28:01,640 --> 10:28:02,180
till they reached

38796
10:28:02,180 --> 10:28:03,740
the house in the hall

38797
10:28:03,740 --> 10:28:04,940
they parted.

38798
10:28:05,900 --> 10:28:07,140
Chapter 59.

38799
10:28:08,360 --> 10:28:09,560
My dear Lizzie.

38800
10:28:09,660 --> 10:28:10,700
Where can you have been

38801
10:28:10,700 --> 10:28:11,900
walking to?

38802
10:28:11,940 --> 10:28:12,680
Was the question

38803
10:28:12,680 --> 10:28:13,260
which Elizabeth

38804
10:28:13,260 --> 10:28:14,180
received from Jane

38805
10:28:14,180 --> 10:28:14,520
as soon as

38806
10:28:14,520 --> 10:28:15,720
she entered their room

38807
10:28:15,740 --> 10:28:16,800
and from all the others

38808
10:28:16,800 --> 10:28:17,360
when they sat

38809
10:28:17,360 --> 10:28:18,560
down to table.

38810
10:28:18,620 --> 10:28:19,620
She had only to say

38811
10:28:19,620 --> 10:28:20,180
in reply

38812
10:28:20,180 --> 10:28:20,600
that they had

38813
10:28:20,600 --> 10:28:21,560
wandered about

38814
10:28:21,560 --> 10:28:22,520
till she was beyond

38815
10:28:22,520 --> 10:28:23,720
her own knowledge.

38816
10:28:23,720 --> 10:28:24,360
She colored

38817
10:28:24,360 --> 10:28:25,560
as she spoke, but

38818
10:28:25,560 --> 10:28:26,480
neither that nor

38819
10:28:26,480 --> 10:28:27,120
anything else

38820
10:28:27,120 --> 10:28:28,140
awakened to suspicion

38821
10:28:28,140 --> 10:28:29,340
of the truth.

38822
10:28:29,520 --> 10:28:30,120
The evening

38823
10:28:30,120 --> 10:28:31,320
passed quietly,

38824
10:28:31,320 --> 10:28:32,460
unmarked by anything

38825
10:28:32,460 --> 10:28:33,660
extraordinary.

38826
10:28:33,660 --> 10:28:34,820
The acknowledged lovers

38827
10:28:34,820 --> 10:28:36,020
talked and laughed.

38828
10:28:36,060 --> 10:28:37,020
The unacknowledged

38829
10:28:37,020 --> 10:28:38,160
were silent.

38830
10:28:38,160 --> 10:28:39,140
Darcy was not

38831
10:28:39,140 --> 10:28:39,920
of a disposition

38832
10:28:39,920 --> 10:28:40,760
in which happiness

38833
10:28:40,760 --> 10:28:41,960
overflows in mirth.

38834
10:28:42,140 --> 10:28:43,020
And Elizabeth

38835
10:28:43,020 --> 10:28:44,540
agitated and confused.

38836
10:28:44,820 --> 10:28:45,800
Rather knew that

38837
10:28:45,800 --> 10:28:46,620
she was happy,

38838
10:28:46,620 --> 10:28:47,280
then felt

38839
10:28:47,280 --> 10:28:48,480
herself to be so

38840
10:28:48,720 --> 10:28:49,560
for besides the

38841
10:28:49,560 --> 10:28:50,760
immediate embarrassment.

38842
10:28:50,880 --> 10:28:51,200
There were

38843
10:28:51,200 --> 10:28:52,640
other evils her.

38844
10:28:53,040 --> 10:28:54,060
She anticipated

38845
10:28:54,060 --> 10:28:54,900
what would be felt

38846
10:28:54,900 --> 10:28:55,560
in the family

38847
10:28:55,560 --> 10:28:56,420
when her situation

38848
10:28:56,420 --> 10:28:57,500
became known.

38849
10:28:57,500 --> 10:28:58,200
She was aware

38850
10:28:58,200 --> 10:28:58,680
that no one

38851
10:28:58,680 --> 10:28:59,280
liked him but.

38852
10:28:59,280 --> 10:29:00,180
Jane, and.

38853
10:29:00,180 --> 10:29:00,960
Even feared that

38854
10:29:00,960 --> 10:29:01,620
with the others

38855
10:29:01,620 --> 10:29:02,460
it was a dislike

38856
10:29:02,460 --> 10:29:03,140
which not all

38857
10:29:03,140 --> 10:29:03,800
his fortune

38858
10:29:03,800 --> 10:29:04,700
and consequence

38859
10:29:04,700 --> 10:29:05,900
might do away.

38860
10:29:06,620 --> 10:29:07,220
At night,

38861
10:29:07,220 --> 10:29:08,180
she opened her heart

38862
10:29:08,180 --> 10:29:09,420
to Jane, though

38863
10:29:09,420 --> 10:29:10,700
suspicion was very far

38864
10:29:10,700 --> 10:29:11,100
from Mr.

38865
10:29:11,100 --> 10:29:12,320
Bennett's habits.

38866
10:29:12,560 --> 10:29:12,920
She was

38867
10:29:12,920 --> 10:29:14,320
absolutely incredulous.

38868
10:29:14,340 --> 10:29:15,960
Here you are

38869
10:29:15,960 --> 10:29:17,160
choking, Lizzie.

38870
10:29:17,340 --> 10:29:19,640
This cannot be engaged

38871
10:29:19,640 --> 10:29:20,840
to Mr. Darcy.

38872
10:29:21,380 --> 10:29:22,160
No, no.

38873
10:29:22,160 --> 10:29:22,880
You shall not

38874
10:29:22,880 --> 10:29:23,660
deceive me.

38875
10:29:23,660 --> 10:29:24,320
I know it to

38876
10:29:24,320 --> 10:29:25,220
be impossible.

38877
10:29:26,280 --> 10:29:26,700
This is a

38878
10:29:26,700 --> 10:29:27,600
wretched beginning.

38879
10:29:27,600 --> 10:29:28,500
Indeed.

38880
10:29:28,500 --> 10:29:29,120
My soul

38881
10:29:29,120 --> 10:29:30,600
dependent was on you.

38882
10:29:30,840 --> 10:29:31,400
And I am sure

38883
10:29:31,400 --> 10:29:32,120
nobody else

38884
10:29:32,120 --> 10:29:32,780
will believe me

38885
10:29:32,780 --> 10:29:33,980
if you do not.

38886
10:29:34,140 --> 10:29:34,820
Yet indeed,

38887
10:29:34,820 --> 10:29:36,020
I am in earnest.

38888
10:29:36,020 --> 10:29:36,480
I speak

38889
10:29:36,480 --> 10:29:37,680
nothing with the truth.

38890
10:29:37,880 --> 10:29:39,020
He still loves me.

38891
10:29:39,020 --> 10:29:40,320
And we are engaged.

38892
10:29:40,940 --> 10:29:41,840
Jane looked at her

38893
10:29:41,840 --> 10:29:43,040
Doubting Lee.

38894
10:29:43,040 --> 10:29:44,120
Oh, Lizzie,

38895
10:29:44,120 --> 10:29:45,320
it cannot be.

38896
10:29:45,500 --> 10:29:46,280
I know how much

38897
10:29:46,280 --> 10:29:47,480
you dislike him.

38898
10:29:47,900 --> 10:29:48,360
You know

38899
10:29:48,360 --> 10:29:49,560
nothing of the matter.

38900
10:29:49,820 --> 10:29:50,660
That Is all

38901
10:29:50,660 --> 10:29:51,860
to be forgot.

38902
10:29:51,920 --> 10:29:52,740
Perhaps I did

38903
10:29:52,740 --> 10:29:53,940
not always love him.

38904
10:29:53,940 --> 10:29:54,500
So well as I.

38905
10:29:54,500 --> 10:29:55,620
Do now.

38906
10:29:55,620 --> 10:29:56,840
But in such cases

38907
10:29:56,840 --> 10:29:58,160
as these good memories

38908
10:29:58,160 --> 10:29:59,360
unpardonable.

38909
10:29:59,460 --> 10:30:00,800
This is the last time.

38910
10:30:00,800 --> 10:30:01,020
I shall.

38911
10:30:01,020 --> 10:30:01,800
Ever remember it.

38912
10:30:01,800 --> 10:30:02,780
Myself.

38913
10:30:02,780 --> 10:30:03,420
Miss Bennet

38914
10:30:03,420 --> 10:30:03,980
still looked

38915
10:30:03,980 --> 10:30:05,100
all amazement.

38916
10:30:05,100 --> 10:30:06,140
Elizabeth again

38917
10:30:06,140 --> 10:30:06,500
and more

38918
10:30:06,500 --> 10:30:07,700
seriously assured her

38919
10:30:07,700 --> 10:30:08,900
of its truth.

38920
10:30:09,180 --> 10:30:10,320
Go to heaven.

38921
10:30:10,320 --> 10:30:11,660
Can it really be so?

38922
10:30:12,060 --> 10:30:12,620
It's now.

38923
10:30:12,620 --> 10:30:13,860
I must believe you,

38924
10:30:14,120 --> 10:30:15,320
cried Jane.

38925
10:30:15,540 --> 10:30:16,340
My dear, dear

38926
10:30:16,340 --> 10:30:17,540
Lizzie, I would.

38927
10:30:17,640 --> 10:30:19,260
I do congratulate you.

38928
10:30:19,700 --> 10:30:20,900
But are you certain?

38929
10:30:21,440 --> 10:30:22,640
Forgive the question.

38930
10:30:22,980 --> 10:30:24,180
Are you quite certain

38931
10:30:24,180 --> 10:30:24,680
that you can be

38932
10:30:24,680 --> 10:30:25,880
happy with him?

38933
10:30:26,360 --> 10:30:26,820
There can be

38934
10:30:26,820 --> 10:30:27,960
no doubt of that.

38935
10:30:27,960 --> 10:30:28,640
It is settled

38936
10:30:28,640 --> 10:30:29,720
between us already

38937
10:30:29,720 --> 10:30:30,380
that we ought to be

38938
10:30:30,380 --> 10:30:31,260
the happiest couple

38939
10:30:31,260 --> 10:30:32,460
in the world.

38940
10:30:32,600 --> 10:30:33,240
But are you

38941
10:30:33,240 --> 10:30:34,440
pleased, Jane?

38942
10:30:34,440 --> 10:30:35,480
Shall you like to have

38943
10:30:35,480 --> 10:30:36,680
such a brother?

38944
10:30:37,040 --> 10:30:38,240
Very, very much.

38945
10:30:38,460 --> 10:30:39,020
Nothing Could

38946
10:30:39,020 --> 10:30:39,480
give either

38947
10:30:39,480 --> 10:30:40,520
Bingley or myself

38948
10:30:40,520 --> 10:30:41,720
more delight.

38949
10:30:41,760 --> 10:30:43,000
But we considered it.

38950
10:30:43,020 --> 10:30:44,000
We talked of it

38951
10:30:44,000 --> 10:30:45,200
as impossible.

38952
10:30:45,420 --> 10:30:45,720
And

38953
10:30:45,720 --> 10:30:46,620
do you really love him

38954
10:30:46,620 --> 10:30:47,820
quite well enough?

38955
10:30:48,200 --> 10:30:49,280
Oh, Lizzie

38956
10:30:49,280 --> 10:30:50,120
do anything

38957
10:30:50,120 --> 10:30:50,940
rather than marry

38958
10:30:50,940 --> 10:30:52,140
without affection.

38959
10:30:52,220 --> 10:30:53,160
Are you quite sure

38960
10:30:53,160 --> 10:30:53,660
that you feel

38961
10:30:53,660 --> 10:30:54,860
what you ought to do?

38962
10:30:55,520 --> 10:30:56,640
Oh, yes.

38963
10:30:56,640 --> 10:30:57,500
You will only think

38964
10:30:57,500 --> 10:30:58,140
I feel more

38965
10:30:58,140 --> 10:30:58,680
than I ought

38966
10:30:58,680 --> 10:30:59,880
do when I tell you all.

38967
10:31:00,620 --> 10:31:01,820
What do you mean?

38968
10:31:02,300 --> 10:31:02,700
Why?

38969
10:31:02,700 --> 10:31:03,680
I must confess

38970
10:31:03,680 --> 10:31:04,280
that I love him

38971
10:31:04,280 --> 10:31:05,060
better than I do

38972
10:31:05,060 --> 10:31:05,780
Bingley.

38973
10:31:05,780 --> 10:31:06,440
I am afraid

38974
10:31:06,440 --> 10:31:07,640
you will be angry.

38975
10:31:08,040 --> 10:31:09,500
My sister.

38976
10:31:09,780 --> 10:31:11,120
Now be serious.

38977
10:31:11,300 --> 10:31:12,140
I want to talk

38978
10:31:12,140 --> 10:31:13,340
very seriously.

38979
10:31:13,820 --> 10:31:15,060
Let me know everything

38980
10:31:15,060 --> 10:31:15,860
that I am to know

38981
10:31:15,860 --> 10:31:17,060
without delay.

38982
10:31:17,160 --> 10:31:18,020
Will you tell me

38983
10:31:18,020 --> 10:31:19,220
how you have loved him?

38984
10:31:20,040 --> 10:31:21,060
It has been coming on

38985
10:31:21,060 --> 10:31:22,340
so gradually that I

38986
10:31:22,340 --> 10:31:22,880
hardly know

38987
10:31:22,880 --> 10:31:24,080
when it began.

38988
10:31:24,380 --> 10:31:25,080
But I believe

38989
10:31:25,080 --> 10:31:25,980
I must date it

38990
10:31:25,980 --> 10:31:26,640
for my first

38991
10:31:26,640 --> 10:31:27,080
seeing his

38992
10:31:27,080 --> 10:31:27,780
beautiful grounds

38993
10:31:27,780 --> 10:31:28,980
at Pemberley.

38994
10:31:29,460 --> 10:31:30,420
Another entreaty

38995
10:31:30,420 --> 10:31:30,960
that she would be

38996
10:31:30,960 --> 10:31:32,060
serious, however,

38997
10:31:32,060 --> 10:31:32,640
produced the

38998
10:31:32,640 --> 10:31:33,840
desired effect.

38999
10:31:33,900 --> 10:31:34,560
And she soon

39000
10:31:34,560 --> 10:31:35,540
satisfied Jane

39001
10:31:35,540 --> 10:31:36,800
by her solemn assurances

39002
10:31:36,800 --> 10:31:38,000
of attachment.

39003
10:31:38,000 --> 10:31:38,760
When convinced

39004
10:31:38,760 --> 10:31:39,780
on that article,

39005
10:31:39,780 --> 10:31:40,820
Miss Bennet had nothing

39006
10:31:40,820 --> 10:31:42,020
further to wish.

39007
10:31:42,080 --> 10:31:43,820
Now I am quite happy,

39008
10:31:44,040 --> 10:31:45,020
said she.

39009
10:31:45,020 --> 10:31:45,980
For you will be as happy

39010
10:31:45,980 --> 10:31:47,180
as myself.

39011
10:31:47,180 --> 10:31:47,940
I always had a

39012
10:31:47,940 --> 10:31:49,140
value for him.

39013
10:31:49,140 --> 10:31:50,000
Were it for nothing

39014
10:31:50,000 --> 10:31:50,940
but his love of you.

39015
10:31:50,940 --> 10:31:51,660
I must always

39016
10:31:51,660 --> 10:31:52,860
have esteemed him.

39017
10:31:52,940 --> 10:31:53,760
But now, as

39018
10:31:53,760 --> 10:31:54,680
Bigley's friend

39019
10:31:54,680 --> 10:31:55,880
and your husband,

39020
10:31:56,060 --> 10:31:57,300
that can only be Bingley

39021
10:31:57,300 --> 10:31:57,860
and yourself

39022
10:31:57,860 --> 10:31:59,060
more dear to me.

39023
10:31:59,400 --> 10:32:00,480
But, Lizzie,

39024
10:32:00,480 --> 10:32:02,340
you have been very sly,

39025
10:32:02,520 --> 10:32:03,960
very reserved with me.

39026
10:32:04,320 --> 10:32:04,880
How little

39027
10:32:04,880 --> 10:32:05,480
did you tell me

39028
10:32:05,480 --> 10:32:06,200
of what passed

39029
10:32:06,200 --> 10:32:07,520
at Pemberley Lambton?

39030
10:32:07,940 --> 10:32:09,060
I owe all that.

39031
10:32:09,060 --> 10:32:10,380
I know of it to another,

39032
10:32:10,380 --> 10:32:11,580
not to you.

39033
10:32:12,120 --> 10:32:13,100
Elizabeth told her

39034
10:32:13,100 --> 10:32:13,680
the motives

39035
10:32:13,680 --> 10:32:14,840
of her secrecy.

39036
10:32:14,840 --> 10:32:15,900
She had been unwilling

39037
10:32:15,900 --> 10:32:16,980
to mention Bingley

39038
10:32:16,980 --> 10:32:18,080
and the unsettled state

39039
10:32:18,080 --> 10:32:18,500
of her own

39040
10:32:18,500 --> 10:32:18,960
feelings

39041
10:32:18,960 --> 10:32:19,800
had made her equally

39042
10:32:19,800 --> 10:32:20,220
avoid the

39043
10:32:20,220 --> 10:32:21,420
name of his friend.

39044
10:32:21,560 --> 10:32:22,320
But now she would

39045
10:32:22,320 --> 10:32:22,760
no longer

39046
10:32:22,760 --> 10:32:23,540
conceal from her

39047
10:32:23,540 --> 10:32:24,000
his share,

39048
10:32:24,000 --> 10:32:25,200
and that his marriage

39049
10:32:25,340 --> 10:32:26,540
always acknowledged

39050
10:32:26,640 --> 10:32:27,840
and half the night spent

39051
10:32:27,840 --> 10:32:29,040
in conversation.

39052
10:32:29,480 --> 10:32:30,740
Good gracious!

39053
10:32:31,020 --> 10:32:31,700
Cried Mrs.

39054
10:32:31,700 --> 10:32:32,040
Bennet

39055
10:32:32,040 --> 10:32:33,080
as she stood at a window

39056
10:32:33,080 --> 10:32:34,280
the next morning.

39057
10:32:34,280 --> 10:32:35,940
If that disagreeable Mr.

39058
10:32:35,940 --> 10:32:36,480
Darcy

39059
10:32:36,480 --> 10:32:37,400
not coming here again

39060
10:32:37,400 --> 10:32:38,600
with our dear Bingley,

39061
10:32:38,760 --> 10:32:39,860
what can he mean

39062
10:32:39,860 --> 10:32:41,160
by being so tiresome

39063
10:32:41,160 --> 10:32:41,820
as to always

39064
10:32:41,820 --> 10:32:43,020
be coming here?

39065
10:32:43,020 --> 10:32:44,000
I had no notion,

39066
10:32:44,000 --> 10:32:44,520
but he would go

39067
10:32:44,520 --> 10:32:45,260
with shooting or

39068
10:32:45,260 --> 10:32:45,960
something or other.

39069
10:32:45,960 --> 10:32:46,640
And not disturb us

39070
10:32:46,640 --> 10:32:47,840
with his company.

39071
10:32:47,840 --> 10:32:48,560
What shall we do

39072
10:32:48,560 --> 10:32:50,040
with him, Lizzie?

39073
10:32:50,120 --> 10:32:50,960
You must walk

39074
10:32:50,960 --> 10:32:51,680
out with him again.

39075
10:32:51,680 --> 10:32:52,400
That he may not be

39076
10:32:52,400 --> 10:32:53,600
in big this way.

39077
10:32:54,120 --> 10:32:54,720
Elizabeth

39078
10:32:54,720 --> 10:32:55,160
could hardly

39079
10:32:55,160 --> 10:32:55,980
help laughing

39080
10:32:55,980 --> 10:32:56,720
so convenient.

39081
10:32:56,720 --> 10:32:58,020
A proposal yet

39082
10:32:58,020 --> 10:32:58,880
was really vexed

39083
10:32:58,880 --> 10:32:59,420
that her mother

39084
10:32:59,420 --> 10:33:00,060
should be always

39085
10:33:00,060 --> 10:33:00,440
giving him

39086
10:33:00,440 --> 10:33:01,640
such an epithet.

39087
10:33:01,820 --> 10:33:02,900
As soon as they entered,

39088
10:33:02,900 --> 10:33:03,720
Bingley looked at her

39089
10:33:03,720 --> 10:33:04,800
so expressively

39090
10:33:04,800 --> 10:33:05,700
and shook hands,

39091
10:33:05,700 --> 10:33:07,080
such warmth as left

39092
10:33:07,080 --> 10:33:07,740
no doubt of

39093
10:33:07,740 --> 10:33:08,940
his good information.

39094
10:33:09,000 --> 10:33:09,320
And he.

39095
10:33:09,320 --> 10:33:10,080
Soon afterwards

39096
10:33:10,080 --> 10:33:11,060
said aloud.

39097
10:33:11,060 --> 10:33:11,340
Mrs.

39098
10:33:11,340 --> 10:33:11,940
Bennet,

39099
10:33:11,940 --> 10:33:13,040
have you no more lanes

39100
10:33:13,040 --> 10:33:13,580
hereabouts

39101
10:33:13,580 --> 10:33:14,280
in which Lizzie may

39102
10:33:14,280 --> 10:33:14,880
lose her way

39103
10:33:14,880 --> 10:33:15,540
again today?

39104
10:33:16,620 --> 10:33:17,660
I advise Mr.

39105
10:33:17,660 --> 10:33:18,440
Darcy and

39106
10:33:18,440 --> 10:33:19,640
Lizzie and Kitty,

39107
10:33:19,740 --> 10:33:20,300
said Mrs.

39108
10:33:20,300 --> 10:33:20,840
Bennet,

39109
10:33:20,840 --> 10:33:21,780
to walk to Oakham

39110
10:33:21,780 --> 10:33:22,760
Mount this morning.

39111
10:33:22,760 --> 10:33:23,940
It is a nice long walk

39112
10:33:23,940 --> 10:33:24,260
and Mr.

39113
10:33:24,260 --> 10:33:24,720
Darcy has

39114
10:33:24,720 --> 10:33:25,920
never seen the view.

39115
10:33:25,920 --> 10:33:26,820
It may do very well

39116
10:33:26,820 --> 10:33:27,540
for the others.

39117
10:33:27,540 --> 10:33:28,280
Replied Mr.

39118
10:33:28,280 --> 10:33:29,100
Bingley, but I am.

39119
10:33:29,100 --> 10:33:29,640
Sure it will be

39120
10:33:29,640 --> 10:33:30,840
too much for Kitty,

39121
10:33:30,920 --> 10:33:31,380
won't it?

39122
10:33:31,380 --> 10:33:32,100
Kitty.

39123
10:33:32,100 --> 10:33:32,720
Kitty owned.

39124
10:33:32,720 --> 10:33:33,120
That she had

39125
10:33:33,120 --> 10:33:33,780
rather stay at.

39126
10:33:33,780 --> 10:33:34,400
Home.

39127
10:33:34,400 --> 10:33:35,360
Darcy professed

39128
10:33:35,360 --> 10:33:36,360
a great curiosity

39129
10:33:36,360 --> 10:33:36,900
to see the view

39130
10:33:36,900 --> 10:33:37,620
from the. Mount.

39131
10:33:37,620 --> 10:33:38,360
And Elizabeth

39132
10:33:38,360 --> 10:33:39,560
silently consented

39133
10:33:39,960 --> 10:33:40,940
as she went upstairs

39134
10:33:40,940 --> 10:33:41,760
to get ready.

39135
10:33:41,760 --> 10:33:42,120
Mrs.

39136
10:33:42,120 --> 10:33:42,800
Bennett followed

39137
10:33:42,800 --> 10:33:43,940
her, saying.

39138
10:33:43,940 --> 10:33:44,840
I am quite

39139
10:33:44,840 --> 10:33:45,440
sorry Lizzie,

39140
10:33:45,440 --> 10:33:45,800
that you should

39141
10:33:45,800 --> 10:33:46,220
be forced

39142
10:33:46,220 --> 10:33:46,620
to have that

39143
10:33:46,620 --> 10:33:47,420
disagreeable man

39144
10:33:47,420 --> 10:33:48,680
or do yourself, but

39145
10:33:48,680 --> 10:33:49,220
I hope you will

39146
10:33:49,220 --> 10:33:49,980
not mind it.

39147
10:33:49,980 --> 10:33:50,900
It is all for Jane

39148
10:33:50,900 --> 10:33:51,840
sake, you know.

39149
10:33:51,840 --> 10:33:52,760
And there is no occasion

39150
10:33:52,760 --> 10:33:53,760
for talking to him

39151
10:33:53,760 --> 10:33:54,440
except just

39152
10:33:54,440 --> 10:33:55,320
now and then.

39153
10:33:55,320 --> 10:33:56,300
So do not put yourself

39154
10:33:56,300 --> 10:33:57,500
to inconvenience.

39155
10:33:57,900 --> 10:33:58,800
During their walk,

39156
10:33:58,800 --> 10:33:59,880
it was resolved that Mr.

39157
10:33:59,880 --> 10:34:00,660
Bennet's consent

39158
10:34:00,660 --> 10:34:01,220
should be asked

39159
10:34:01,220 --> 10:34:01,680
in the course

39160
10:34:01,680 --> 10:34:02,640
of the evening.

39161
10:34:02,640 --> 10:34:03,540
Elizabeth reserved

39162
10:34:03,540 --> 10:34:04,140
to herself

39163
10:34:04,140 --> 10:34:04,920
the application

39164
10:34:04,920 --> 10:34:06,080
for her mother's.

39165
10:34:06,080 --> 10:34:06,660
She could not.

39166
10:34:06,660 --> 10:34:07,140
Determine

39167
10:34:07,140 --> 10:34:07,620
how her mother

39168
10:34:07,620 --> 10:34:08,480
would take it,

39169
10:34:08,480 --> 10:34:09,540
sometimes doubting

39170
10:34:09,540 --> 10:34:10,520
whether all his wealth

39171
10:34:10,520 --> 10:34:11,060
and grandeur

39172
10:34:11,060 --> 10:34:11,580
would be enough

39173
10:34:11,580 --> 10:34:12,120
to overcome

39174
10:34:12,120 --> 10:34:12,780
her abhorrence

39175
10:34:12,780 --> 10:34:13,680
of the man.

39176
10:34:13,680 --> 10:34:14,280
But whether she

39177
10:34:14,280 --> 10:34:15,000
were violently set

39178
10:34:15,000 --> 10:34:15,780
against the match

39179
10:34:15,780 --> 10:34:16,380
or violently

39180
10:34:16,380 --> 10:34:17,400
delighted with it,

39181
10:34:17,400 --> 10:34:18,020
it was certain

39182
10:34:18,020 --> 10:34:18,600
that her manner

39183
10:34:18,600 --> 10:34:18,840
would be

39184
10:34:18,840 --> 10:34:19,440
equally ill

39185
10:34:19,440 --> 10:34:20,180
adapted to due

39186
10:34:20,180 --> 10:34:21,380
credit to her sense

39187
10:34:21,600 --> 10:34:22,020
that she could

39188
10:34:22,020 --> 10:34:23,100
no more bear that Mr.

39189
10:34:23,100 --> 10:34:23,840
Darcy should hear

39190
10:34:23,840 --> 10:34:24,200
the first

39191
10:34:24,200 --> 10:34:25,400
raptures of her joy

39192
10:34:25,520 --> 10:34:26,640
than the first vehemence

39193
10:34:26,640 --> 10:34:27,840
of her disapprobation.

39194
10:34:29,000 --> 10:34:29,300
In the

39195
10:34:29,300 --> 10:34:30,560
evening, soon after Mr.

39196
10:34:30,560 --> 10:34:30,860
Bennett

39197
10:34:30,860 --> 10:34:32,060
withdrew to the library,

39198
10:34:32,220 --> 10:34:32,940
she saw Mr.

39199
10:34:32,940 --> 10:34:33,660
Darcy rise

39200
10:34:33,660 --> 10:34:34,860
also and follow him,

39201
10:34:34,980 --> 10:34:36,060
and her agitation on

39202
10:34:36,060 --> 10:34:37,340
seeing it was extreme.

39203
10:34:37,700 --> 10:34:38,280
She did not.

39204
10:34:38,280 --> 10:34:39,000
Fear her father's.

39205
10:34:39,000 --> 10:34:40,200
Opposition, but he.

39206
10:34:40,200 --> 10:34:40,700
Was going to

39207
10:34:40,700 --> 10:34:41,900
be made unhappy

39208
10:34:41,960 --> 10:34:42,740
and that it should be

39209
10:34:42,740 --> 10:34:43,100
through her.

39210
10:34:43,100 --> 10:34:44,360
Means that she.

39211
10:34:44,400 --> 10:34:45,320
His favorite child

39212
10:34:45,320 --> 10:34:45,560
should be

39213
10:34:45,560 --> 10:34:46,220
distressing him

39214
10:34:46,220 --> 10:34:47,120
by her choice,

39215
10:34:47,120 --> 10:34:47,900
should be filling him

39216
10:34:47,900 --> 10:34:49,040
with fears and regrets

39217
10:34:49,040 --> 10:34:50,220
and disposing of her

39218
10:34:50,220 --> 10:34:50,520
was a

39219
10:34:50,520 --> 10:34:51,720
wretched reflection.

39220
10:34:51,800 --> 10:34:52,980
And she sat in misery

39221
10:34:52,980 --> 10:34:53,420
till Mr.

39222
10:34:53,420 --> 10:34:54,620
Darcy appeared.

39223
10:34:54,780 --> 10:34:55,700
When looking at him,

39224
10:34:55,700 --> 10:34:56,040
she was a

39225
10:34:56,040 --> 10:34:56,700
little relieved

39226
10:34:56,700 --> 10:34:57,900
by his smile.

39227
10:34:57,960 --> 10:34:58,200
In a.

39228
10:34:58,200 --> 10:34:58,760
Few minutes,

39229
10:34:58,760 --> 10:34:59,700
he approached the table

39230
10:34:59,700 --> 10:35:00,320
where she was sitting

39231
10:35:00,320 --> 10:35:01,140
with Kitty

39232
10:35:01,140 --> 10:35:01,980
and while pretending

39233
10:35:01,980 --> 10:35:03,060
to admire her work,

39234
10:35:03,060 --> 10:35:04,260
said in a whisper.

39235
10:35:04,640 --> 10:35:05,700
Go to your father.

39236
10:35:05,700 --> 10:35:06,300
He wants you

39237
10:35:06,300 --> 10:35:07,500
in the library.

39238
10:35:07,580 --> 10:35:08,780
She was gone directly.

39239
10:35:09,480 --> 10:35:10,460
Her father was walking

39240
10:35:10,460 --> 10:35:11,060
about the room,

39241
10:35:11,060 --> 10:35:11,760
looking grave

39242
10:35:11,760 --> 10:35:12,960
and anxious.

39243
10:35:13,020 --> 10:35:14,240
Lizzie said he.

39244
10:35:14,340 --> 10:35:15,380
What are you doing?

39245
10:35:15,380 --> 10:35:15,860
Are you out

39246
10:35:15,860 --> 10:35:16,700
of your senses

39247
10:35:16,700 --> 10:35:17,460
to be accepting

39248
10:35:17,460 --> 10:35:18,180
this man?

39249
10:35:18,180 --> 10:35:18,600
Have not

39250
10:35:18,600 --> 10:35:19,800
you always hated him?

39251
10:35:20,580 --> 10:35:21,420
How earnestly

39252
10:35:21,420 --> 10:35:21,920
that she then

39253
10:35:21,920 --> 10:35:22,380
wished that her

39254
10:35:22,380 --> 10:35:23,300
former opinions

39255
10:35:23,300 --> 10:35:24,440
been more reasonable,

39256
10:35:24,440 --> 10:35:25,320
her expressions

39257
10:35:25,320 --> 10:35:26,420
more moderate.

39258
10:35:26,420 --> 10:35:27,380
It would have spared her

39259
10:35:27,380 --> 10:35:28,280
from explanations

39260
10:35:28,280 --> 10:35:29,000
and professions,

39261
10:35:29,000 --> 10:35:29,880
which it was exceedingly

39262
10:35:29,880 --> 10:35:31,080
awkward to give,

39263
10:35:31,200 --> 10:35:32,000
but they were now

39264
10:35:32,000 --> 10:35:33,120
necessary and

39265
10:35:33,120 --> 10:35:33,740
assured him

39266
10:35:33,740 --> 10:35:34,680
with some confusion

39267
10:35:34,680 --> 10:35:35,880
of her attachment to Mr.

39268
10:35:35,880 --> 10:35:36,600
Darcy.

39269
10:35:36,600 --> 10:35:37,460
Or in other words,

39270
10:35:37,460 --> 10:35:38,280
you are determined

39271
10:35:38,280 --> 10:35:38,940
to have him.

39272
10:35:38,940 --> 10:35:40,340
He is rich, to be sure,

39273
10:35:40,400 --> 10:35:41,120
and you may have more

39274
10:35:41,120 --> 10:35:42,480
fine clothes and fine

39275
10:35:42,480 --> 10:35:43,760
carriages than Jane,

39276
10:35:44,040 --> 10:35:44,540
but will

39277
10:35:44,540 --> 10:35:45,740
they make you happy?

39278
10:35:45,920 --> 10:35:46,320
Have you

39279
10:35:46,320 --> 10:35:47,520
any other objection?

39280
10:35:47,540 --> 10:35:48,600
Said Elizabeth.

39281
10:35:48,600 --> 10:35:49,320
Then your belief

39282
10:35:49,320 --> 10:35:50,520
of my indifference?

39283
10:35:51,120 --> 10:35:52,160
None at all.

39284
10:35:52,160 --> 10:35:53,060
We all know him to

39285
10:35:53,060 --> 10:35:53,580
a proud,

39286
10:35:53,580 --> 10:35:54,860
unpleasant sort of man.

39287
10:35:55,100 --> 10:35:55,520
But this would

39288
10:35:55,520 --> 10:35:55,980
be nothing

39289
10:35:55,980 --> 10:35:57,180
if you really liked him.

39290
10:35:57,720 --> 10:35:58,820
I do.

39291
10:35:58,820 --> 10:36:00,020
I do like him.

39292
10:36:00,300 --> 10:36:00,960
She replied

39293
10:36:00,960 --> 10:36:02,160
with tears in her eyes.

39294
10:36:02,600 --> 10:36:03,800
I love him.

39295
10:36:03,960 --> 10:36:04,400
Indeed.

39296
10:36:04,400 --> 10:36:05,220
He has no

39297
10:36:05,220 --> 10:36:06,420
improper pride.

39298
10:36:06,600 --> 10:36:08,220
He is perfectly amiable.

39299
10:36:08,660 --> 10:36:09,480
He do not know

39300
10:36:09,480 --> 10:36:10,680
what he really is.

39301
10:36:10,700 --> 10:36:11,220
Then pray,

39302
10:36:11,220 --> 10:36:12,800
do not pain me by of him

39303
10:36:12,800 --> 10:36:14,000
in such terms.

39304
10:36:14,580 --> 10:36:15,920
Lizzie said her father.

39305
10:36:16,080 --> 10:36:16,820
I have given him

39306
10:36:16,820 --> 10:36:18,020
my consent.

39307
10:36:18,140 --> 10:36:18,800
He is the kind

39308
10:36:18,800 --> 10:36:20,040
of man indeed, to whom

39309
10:36:20,040 --> 10:36:20,840
I should never dare

39310
10:36:20,840 --> 10:36:21,840
refuse anything

39311
10:36:21,840 --> 10:36:22,220
which he

39312
10:36:22,220 --> 10:36:23,640
condescended to ask.

39313
10:36:24,080 --> 10:36:25,280
I now give it to you

39314
10:36:25,320 --> 10:36:26,340
if you are resolved

39315
10:36:26,340 --> 10:36:27,260
on having him.

39316
10:36:27,260 --> 10:36:28,340
But let me advise you

39317
10:36:28,340 --> 10:36:29,540
to think better of it.

39318
10:36:29,700 --> 10:36:30,300
I know your

39319
10:36:30,300 --> 10:36:31,580
disposition, Lizzie.

39320
10:36:31,680 --> 10:36:32,720
I Know that you could be

39321
10:36:32,720 --> 10:36:33,560
neither happy

39322
10:36:33,560 --> 10:36:34,740
nor respectable

39323
10:36:34,740 --> 10:36:35,300
unless you

39324
10:36:35,300 --> 10:36:36,200
truly esteemed

39325
10:36:36,200 --> 10:36:37,020
your husband.

39326
10:36:37,020 --> 10:36:37,580
Unless you

39327
10:36:37,580 --> 10:36:38,360
looked up to him

39328
10:36:38,360 --> 10:36:39,560
as a superior.

39329
10:36:39,900 --> 10:36:40,920
Your lively talents

39330
10:36:40,920 --> 10:36:41,420
would place you

39331
10:36:41,420 --> 10:36:42,420
in greatest danger.

39332
10:36:42,420 --> 10:36:43,640
In an unequal marriage.

39333
10:36:44,820 --> 10:36:45,620
You could scarcely

39334
10:36:45,620 --> 10:36:46,620
escape, discredit,

39335
10:36:46,620 --> 10:36:47,820
and misery.

39336
10:36:48,120 --> 10:36:49,320
My child,

39337
10:36:49,440 --> 10:36:49,920
let me not

39338
10:36:49,920 --> 10:36:50,460
have the grief

39339
10:36:50,460 --> 10:36:51,660
of seeing you

39340
10:36:51,680 --> 10:36:52,260
to respect

39341
10:36:52,260 --> 10:36:53,460
your partner in life.

39342
10:36:54,840 --> 10:36:55,160
You know

39343
10:36:55,160 --> 10:36:56,360
not what you are about.

39344
10:36:57,560 --> 10:36:58,160
Elizabeth

39345
10:36:58,160 --> 10:36:59,340
still more affected

39346
10:36:59,340 --> 10:37:00,560
was earnest and solemn

39347
10:37:00,560 --> 10:37:01,640
in her reply

39348
10:37:01,640 --> 10:37:02,360
and at length

39349
10:37:02,360 --> 10:37:03,560
by repeated assurances

39350
10:37:03,560 --> 10:37:03,960
that Mr.

39351
10:37:03,960 --> 10:37:04,740
Darcy was really

39352
10:37:04,740 --> 10:37:05,300
the object

39353
10:37:05,300 --> 10:37:06,300
of her choice.

39354
10:37:06,300 --> 10:37:07,020
By explaining

39355
10:37:07,020 --> 10:37:08,000
the gradual change

39356
10:37:08,000 --> 10:37:08,280
which her

39357
10:37:08,280 --> 10:37:09,080
estimation of him

39358
10:37:09,080 --> 10:37:10,020
had undergone,

39359
10:37:10,020 --> 10:37:10,640
relating her

39360
10:37:10,640 --> 10:37:11,660
absolute certainty

39361
10:37:11,660 --> 10:37:12,320
that his affection

39362
10:37:12,320 --> 10:37:12,840
was not the

39363
10:37:12,840 --> 10:37:13,820
work of a day,

39364
10:37:13,820 --> 10:37:14,400
but had stood

39365
10:37:14,400 --> 10:37:15,320
the test of many months,

39366
10:37:15,320 --> 10:37:16,500
suspense. And.

39367
10:37:16,500 --> 10:37:17,700
Enumerating with energy

39368
10:37:17,700 --> 10:37:18,900
all his good qualities.

39369
10:37:19,200 --> 10:37:20,160
She did conquer her

39370
10:37:20,160 --> 10:37:21,360
father's incredulity

39371
10:37:21,480 --> 10:37:22,520
and reconcile him

39372
10:37:22,520 --> 10:37:23,720
to the match.

39373
10:37:23,940 --> 10:37:25,140
Well, my dear.

39374
10:37:25,500 --> 10:37:26,040
Said he,

39375
10:37:26,040 --> 10:37:27,240
when she sees speaking.

39376
10:37:27,920 --> 10:37:29,240
I have no more to say.

39377
10:37:29,540 --> 10:37:30,500
If this be the case,

39378
10:37:30,500 --> 10:37:31,640
he deserves.

39379
10:37:31,640 --> 10:37:32,720
I could not have parted

39380
10:37:32,720 --> 10:37:33,720
with you, my Lizzie,

39381
10:37:33,720 --> 10:37:35,160
to anyone less worthy.

39382
10:37:36,240 --> 10:37:36,860
To complete.

39383
10:37:36,860 --> 10:37:37,400
The favorable

39384
10:37:37,400 --> 10:37:38,160
impression.

39385
10:37:38,160 --> 10:37:39,060
She then told him

39386
10:37:39,060 --> 10:37:39,480
what Mr.

39387
10:37:39,480 --> 10:37:39,980
Darcy had

39388
10:37:39,980 --> 10:37:41,100
voluntarily done.

39389
10:37:41,100 --> 10:37:41,880
Lydia.

39390
10:37:41,880 --> 10:37:42,440
He heard her

39391
10:37:42,440 --> 10:37:43,640
with astonishment.

39392
10:37:43,980 --> 10:37:44,720
This is an evening

39393
10:37:44,720 --> 10:37:45,420
of wonders.

39394
10:37:45,420 --> 10:37:46,100
Indeed.

39395
10:37:46,100 --> 10:37:47,340
And so Darcy

39396
10:37:47,340 --> 10:37:48,260
did everything.

39397
10:37:48,260 --> 10:37:49,440
Made up the match.

39398
10:37:49,440 --> 10:37:50,840
Gave the money paid

39399
10:37:50,840 --> 10:37:51,780
the fellow's debts

39400
10:37:51,780 --> 10:37:52,380
and got him

39401
10:37:52,380 --> 10:37:53,100
his commission.

39402
10:37:53,100 --> 10:37:54,240
So much the better.

39403
10:37:54,240 --> 10:37:55,080
It will save me

39404
10:37:55,080 --> 10:37:56,100
a world of trouble

39405
10:37:56,100 --> 10:37:56,960
and economy.

39406
10:37:56,960 --> 10:37:57,480
Had it been

39407
10:37:57,480 --> 10:37:58,520
your uncle's doing,

39408
10:37:58,520 --> 10:37:59,120
I must have.

39409
10:37:59,120 --> 10:38:00,060
Would have paid him.

39410
10:38:00,060 --> 10:38:01,040
But These violent

39411
10:38:01,040 --> 10:38:01,740
young lovers

39412
10:38:01,740 --> 10:38:02,600
carry everything

39413
10:38:02,600 --> 10:38:03,480
their own way.

39414
10:38:03,480 --> 10:38:04,040
I shall offer

39415
10:38:04,040 --> 10:38:05,300
to pay him tomorrow.

39416
10:38:05,340 --> 10:38:06,740
He will rant and storm

39417
10:38:06,740 --> 10:38:07,940
about his love for you.

39418
10:38:08,120 --> 10:38:08,420
And there

39419
10:38:08,420 --> 10:38:09,080
will be an end

39420
10:38:09,080 --> 10:38:10,280
of the matter.

39421
10:38:10,400 --> 10:38:11,400
He then recollected

39422
10:38:11,400 --> 10:38:12,080
her embarrassment

39423
10:38:12,080 --> 10:38:12,540
a few days

39424
10:38:12,540 --> 10:38:13,140
before

39425
10:38:13,140 --> 10:38:14,060
on his reading Mr.

39426
10:38:14,060 --> 10:38:15,600
Collins letter and after

39427
10:38:15,600 --> 10:38:16,220
laughing at her

39428
10:38:16,220 --> 10:38:17,600
some time, allowed her

39429
10:38:17,600 --> 10:38:18,800
at last to go,

39430
10:38:18,860 --> 10:38:19,820
saying as she quitted

39431
10:38:19,820 --> 10:38:20,600
the room.

39432
10:38:20,600 --> 10:38:21,480
If any young men

39433
10:38:21,480 --> 10:38:22,740
come for Mary or Kitty,

39434
10:38:22,940 --> 10:38:24,000
send them in for

39435
10:38:24,000 --> 10:38:25,200
I am quite at leisure.

39436
10:38:25,700 --> 10:38:26,600
Elizabeth's mind

39437
10:38:26,600 --> 10:38:27,300
was now relieved

39438
10:38:27,300 --> 10:38:27,780
from a very

39439
10:38:27,780 --> 10:38:28,580
heavy weight,

39440
10:38:28,580 --> 10:38:29,660
and after half an hour's

39441
10:38:29,660 --> 10:38:30,480
quiet reflection

39442
10:38:30,480 --> 10:38:30,900
in her own.

39443
10:38:30,900 --> 10:38:31,500
Room,

39444
10:38:31,500 --> 10:38:32,360
she was able to join.

39445
10:38:32,360 --> 10:38:32,820
The others

39446
10:38:32,820 --> 10:38:33,420
with tolerable

39447
10:38:33,420 --> 10:38:34,460
composure.

39448
10:38:34,460 --> 10:38:35,360
Everything was too

39449
10:38:35,360 --> 10:38:36,560
recent for gaiety,

39450
10:38:36,600 --> 10:38:37,640
but the evening passed

39451
10:38:37,640 --> 10:38:38,840
tranquilly away.

39452
10:38:38,880 --> 10:38:39,660
There was no longer

39453
10:38:39,660 --> 10:38:40,460
anything material

39454
10:38:40,460 --> 10:38:41,360
to be dreaded,

39455
10:38:41,360 --> 10:38:42,620
and the comfort of ease

39456
10:38:42,620 --> 10:38:43,500
and familiarity

39457
10:38:43,500 --> 10:38:44,700
would come in time

39458
10:38:45,240 --> 10:38:46,200
when her mother went up

39459
10:38:46,200 --> 10:38:46,440
to her

39460
10:38:46,440 --> 10:38:47,400
dressing room at night.

39461
10:38:47,400 --> 10:38:48,240
She followed her

39462
10:38:48,240 --> 10:38:48,660
and made

39463
10:38:48,660 --> 10:38:49,260
the important

39464
10:38:49,260 --> 10:38:50,420
communication.

39465
10:38:50,420 --> 10:38:51,080
It's a fact

39466
10:38:51,080 --> 10:38:52,380
was most extraordinary

39467
10:38:52,640 --> 10:38:53,840
for on first hearing it.

39468
10:38:53,960 --> 10:38:54,320
Mrs.

39469
10:38:54,320 --> 10:38:55,320
Bennett sat quite

39470
10:38:55,320 --> 10:38:56,640
still and unable

39471
10:38:56,640 --> 10:38:57,840
to utter a syllable,

39472
10:38:58,080 --> 10:38:59,180
nor was it under many,

39473
10:38:59,180 --> 10:38:59,720
many minutes

39474
10:38:59,720 --> 10:38:59,960
that she

39475
10:38:59,960 --> 10:39:00,620
could comprehend

39476
10:39:00,620 --> 10:39:01,700
what she heard.

39477
10:39:01,700 --> 10:39:02,640
Though not in general,

39478
10:39:02,640 --> 10:39:03,620
backward to credit

39479
10:39:03,620 --> 10:39:04,200
what was for the

39480
10:39:04,200 --> 10:39:05,400
advantage of her family,

39481
10:39:05,580 --> 10:39:06,120
or that came

39482
10:39:06,120 --> 10:39:06,960
in the shape of a lover

39483
10:39:06,960 --> 10:39:08,120
to any of them.

39484
10:39:08,120 --> 10:39:09,120
She began at length

39485
10:39:09,120 --> 10:39:09,980
to recover,

39486
10:39:09,980 --> 10:39:10,460
to fidget

39487
10:39:10,460 --> 10:39:11,520
about in her chair.

39488
10:39:11,520 --> 10:39:12,740
Get up, sit down

39489
10:39:12,740 --> 10:39:13,160
again,

39490
10:39:13,160 --> 10:39:13,920
wonder and

39491
10:39:13,920 --> 10:39:15,120
bless herself.

39492
10:39:15,380 --> 10:39:16,580
Good gracious,

39493
10:39:16,920 --> 10:39:18,120
Lord, bless me.

39494
10:39:18,440 --> 10:39:20,060
Only think dear

39495
10:39:20,060 --> 10:39:21,360
me, Mr.

39496
10:39:21,360 --> 10:39:22,520
Darcy.

39497
10:39:22,520 --> 10:39:22,740
Who

39498
10:39:22,740 --> 10:39:23,820
would have thought it?

39499
10:39:23,820 --> 10:39:25,140
And is it really true?

39500
10:39:25,640 --> 10:39:27,080
Oh, my sweetest Lizzie.

39501
10:39:27,240 --> 10:39:27,840
How rich

39502
10:39:27,840 --> 10:39:28,500
and how great

39503
10:39:28,500 --> 10:39:29,340
you would be.

39504
10:39:29,340 --> 10:39:30,480
What pin money,

39505
10:39:30,480 --> 10:39:31,340
what jewels,

39506
10:39:31,340 --> 10:39:32,100
what carriages

39507
10:39:32,100 --> 10:39:32,960
you will have.

39508
10:39:32,960 --> 10:39:34,440
James is nothing to it.

39509
10:39:34,560 --> 10:39:35,700
Nothing at all.

39510
10:39:36,660 --> 10:39:37,100
I am so

39511
10:39:37,100 --> 10:39:38,480
pleased, so happy,

39512
10:39:38,700 --> 10:39:39,860
such A charming man.

39513
10:39:39,860 --> 10:39:41,400
So handsome, so tall.

39514
10:39:41,840 --> 10:39:42,780
Oh, my dear Lizzie,

39515
10:39:42,780 --> 10:39:43,840
pray, apologize.

39516
10:39:43,840 --> 10:39:44,760
My having disliked him

39517
10:39:44,760 --> 10:39:45,960
so much before.

39518
10:39:45,960 --> 10:39:46,460
I hope

39519
10:39:46,460 --> 10:39:47,640
you will overlook it.

39520
10:39:47,640 --> 10:39:48,900
Dear, dear Lizzie,

39521
10:39:49,280 --> 10:39:50,400
the house in town.

39522
10:39:50,400 --> 10:39:51,060
Everything

39523
10:39:51,060 --> 10:39:52,260
that is charming.

39524
10:39:52,260 --> 10:39:53,420
Three daughters

39525
10:39:53,420 --> 10:39:55,380
married 10,000 a year.

39526
10:39:55,740 --> 10:39:56,780
Oh, Lord.

39527
10:39:56,780 --> 10:39:57,740
What will become of me?

39528
10:39:57,740 --> 10:39:59,000
I shall go distracted.

39529
10:40:00,000 --> 10:40:00,780
This was enough

39530
10:40:00,780 --> 10:40:01,200
to prove

39531
10:40:01,200 --> 10:40:01,400
that her

39532
10:40:01,400 --> 10:40:02,220
approbation need.

39533
10:40:02,220 --> 10:40:03,380
Not be doubted.

39534
10:40:03,380 --> 10:40:04,620
And Elizabeth, rejoicing

39535
10:40:04,620 --> 10:40:05,540
that such an effusion

39536
10:40:05,540 --> 10:40:05,940
was heard

39537
10:40:05,940 --> 10:40:07,040
only by herself.

39538
10:40:07,040 --> 10:40:07,620
Soon went.

39539
10:40:07,620 --> 10:40:08,400
Away.

39540
10:40:08,400 --> 10:40:09,140
But before

39541
10:40:09,140 --> 10:40:09,920
had been 3 minutes

39542
10:40:09,920 --> 10:40:10,860
in her own room.

39543
10:40:10,860 --> 10:40:12,060
Her mother followed her.

39544
10:40:12,420 --> 10:40:13,100
My dearest

39545
10:40:13,100 --> 10:40:14,420
child, she cried.

39546
10:40:14,600 --> 10:40:15,140
I can think of

39547
10:40:15,140 --> 10:40:15,960
nothing else.

39548
10:40:15,960 --> 10:40:17,240
10,000 a year

39549
10:40:17,240 --> 10:40:18,780
and very likely more

39550
10:40:19,140 --> 10:40:20,340
tis is good as a lord

39551
10:40:20,520 --> 10:40:21,820
and a special license.

39552
10:40:21,860 --> 10:40:22,500
You must

39553
10:40:22,500 --> 10:40:23,400
and shall be married

39554
10:40:23,400 --> 10:40:24,660
by a special license.

39555
10:40:25,160 --> 10:40:26,120
But, my dearest love,

39556
10:40:26,120 --> 10:40:27,300
tell me what dish Mr.

39557
10:40:27,300 --> 10:40:27,780
Darcy is

39558
10:40:27,780 --> 10:40:28,980
particularly fond.

39559
10:40:29,100 --> 10:40:29,540
That I may

39560
10:40:29,540 --> 10:40:30,740
have it tomorrow.

39561
10:40:31,340 --> 10:40:31,940
This was a.

39562
10:40:31,940 --> 10:40:32,940
Sad omen of what

39563
10:40:32,940 --> 10:40:33,740
her mother's behavior

39564
10:40:33,740 --> 10:40:34,760
to the gentleman himself

39565
10:40:34,760 --> 10:40:35,600
might be.

39566
10:40:35,600 --> 10:40:36,200
And Elizabeth

39567
10:40:36,200 --> 10:40:37,260
found that, though,

39568
10:40:37,260 --> 10:40:37,680
in the search

39569
10:40:37,680 --> 10:40:38,180
and possession

39570
10:40:38,180 --> 10:40:38,420
of his

39571
10:40:38,420 --> 10:40:39,480
warmest affection.

39572
10:40:39,480 --> 10:40:40,140
And secure.

39573
10:40:40,140 --> 10:40:40,860
Of her relations.

39574
10:40:40,860 --> 10:40:41,660
Consent.

39575
10:40:41,660 --> 10:40:42,020
There was

39576
10:40:42,020 --> 10:40:42,740
still something

39577
10:40:42,740 --> 10:40:43,940
to be wished for.

39578
10:40:44,060 --> 10:40:44,780
But the morrow

39579
10:40:44,780 --> 10:40:45,840
passed off much better

39580
10:40:45,840 --> 10:40:47,040
than she expected.

39581
10:40:47,040 --> 10:40:47,540
For Mrs.

39582
10:40:47,540 --> 10:40:48,560
Bennett, luckily stood,

39583
10:40:48,560 --> 10:40:48,980
in search

39584
10:40:48,980 --> 10:40:50,180
of her intended son

39585
10:40:50,180 --> 10:40:50,700
in law,

39586
10:40:50,700 --> 10:40:51,360
that she ventured

39587
10:40:51,360 --> 10:40:52,460
not to speak to him

39588
10:40:52,460 --> 10:40:53,120
unless it was

39589
10:40:53,120 --> 10:40:53,640
in her power

39590
10:40:53,640 --> 10:40:54,140
to offer him

39591
10:40:54,140 --> 10:40:55,480
any attention or mark

39592
10:40:55,480 --> 10:40:56,160
her deference

39593
10:40:56,160 --> 10:40:57,360
for his opinion.

39594
10:40:57,900 --> 10:40:58,500
Elizabeth

39595
10:40:58,500 --> 10:40:59,420
had the satisfaction

39596
10:40:59,420 --> 10:40:59,900
of seeing her

39597
10:40:59,900 --> 10:41:00,980
father taking pains

39598
10:41:00,980 --> 10:41:01,620
to get acquainted

39599
10:41:01,620 --> 10:41:02,700
with him, and Mr.

39600
10:41:02,700 --> 10:41:03,660
Bennett soon assured her

39601
10:41:03,660 --> 10:41:04,440
that he was rising

39602
10:41:04,440 --> 10:41:05,100
every hour

39603
10:41:05,100 --> 10:41:06,300
in his esteem.

39604
10:41:06,360 --> 10:41:07,200
I admire

39605
10:41:07,200 --> 10:41:08,400
all my three sons

39606
10:41:08,420 --> 10:41:09,780
law highly, said he.

39607
10:41:10,080 --> 10:41:10,460
Wickham,

39608
10:41:10,460 --> 10:41:11,780
perhaps, is my favorite.

39609
10:41:12,080 --> 10:41:13,100
But I think I shall like

39610
10:41:13,100 --> 10:41:13,680
your husband

39611
10:41:13,680 --> 10:41:14,940
quite as well as Jane's.

39612
10:41:16,440 --> 10:41:17,640
Chapter 60

39613
10:41:18,540 --> 10:41:19,920
Elizabeth Spirit soon

39614
10:41:19,920 --> 10:41:20,360
rising to

39615
10:41:20,360 --> 10:41:21,440
playfulness again.

39616
10:41:21,440 --> 10:41:22,260
She wanted Mr.

39617
10:41:22,260 --> 10:41:23,100
Darcy to account

39618
10:41:23,100 --> 10:41:23,700
for his having

39619
10:41:23,700 --> 10:41:24,360
ever fallen

39620
10:41:24,360 --> 10:41:25,560
in love with her.

39621
10:41:25,740 --> 10:41:26,940
How could you begin?

39622
10:41:27,060 --> 10:41:28,040
Said she.

39623
10:41:28,040 --> 10:41:29,000
I can comprehend.

39624
10:41:29,000 --> 10:41:29,660
Your going on

39625
10:41:29,660 --> 10:41:30,360
charmingly, when.

39626
10:41:30,360 --> 10:41:30,680
Once you

39627
10:41:30,680 --> 10:41:31,820
had made a beginning.

39628
10:41:31,820 --> 10:41:32,400
But what could

39629
10:41:32,400 --> 10:41:33,020
set you off

39630
10:41:33,020 --> 10:41:34,220
in the first place?

39631
10:41:35,220 --> 10:41:36,180
I cannot fix

39632
10:41:36,180 --> 10:41:37,640
on the hour or the spot.

39633
10:41:37,760 --> 10:41:38,760
The look or the woods

39634
10:41:38,760 --> 10:41:39,240
which laid

39635
10:41:39,240 --> 10:41:40,440
the foundation.

39636
10:41:41,000 --> 10:41:42,200
It is too long ago.

39637
10:41:42,380 --> 10:41:43,220
I was in the middle

39638
10:41:43,220 --> 10:41:44,060
before I knew that

39639
10:41:44,060 --> 10:41:45,260
I had begun

39640
10:41:45,860 --> 10:41:46,760
my beauty.

39641
10:41:46,760 --> 10:41:47,960
You had early,

39642
10:41:48,320 --> 10:41:48,720
had asked

39643
10:41:48,720 --> 10:41:49,620
for my manners.

39644
10:41:49,620 --> 10:41:50,720
My behavior to you

39645
10:41:50,720 --> 10:41:51,240
was at least

39646
10:41:51,240 --> 10:41:52,140
always bordering

39647
10:41:52,140 --> 10:41:53,220
on the uncivil.

39648
10:41:53,220 --> 10:41:54,200
And I never spoke to you

39649
10:41:54,200 --> 10:41:55,080
without rather wishing

39650
10:41:55,080 --> 10:41:55,440
to give you

39651
10:41:55,440 --> 10:41:56,640
pain than not.

39652
10:41:57,080 --> 10:41:58,280
Now, be sincere.

39653
10:41:58,520 --> 10:41:59,420
Did you admire me

39654
10:41:59,420 --> 10:42:00,440
for my impertinence?

39655
10:42:01,860 --> 10:42:02,160
For the

39656
10:42:02,160 --> 10:42:03,360
liveliness of your mind?

39657
10:42:03,360 --> 10:42:04,520
I did.

39658
10:42:04,520 --> 10:42:05,700
You may as well call it

39659
10:42:05,700 --> 10:42:07,040
impertinence at once.

39660
10:42:07,260 --> 10:42:08,220
It was very little.

39661
10:42:08,220 --> 10:42:08,660
Yes.

39662
10:42:08,660 --> 10:42:09,560
The fact is

39663
10:42:09,560 --> 10:42:10,440
that you were sick

39664
10:42:10,440 --> 10:42:11,340
of civility,

39665
10:42:11,340 --> 10:42:12,260
of deference,

39666
10:42:12,260 --> 10:42:13,560
of officious attention.

39667
10:42:13,880 --> 10:42:14,960
You were disgusted

39668
10:42:14,960 --> 10:42:15,500
with the women

39669
10:42:15,500 --> 10:42:16,220
who were always

39670
10:42:16,220 --> 10:42:17,540
speaking, looking

39671
10:42:17,540 --> 10:42:18,080
and thinking

39672
10:42:18,080 --> 10:42:18,560
for your

39673
10:42:18,560 --> 10:42:19,760
approbation alone.

39674
10:42:19,980 --> 10:42:20,840
I roused

39675
10:42:20,840 --> 10:42:21,840
and interested you

39676
10:42:21,840 --> 10:42:22,320
because I was

39677
10:42:22,320 --> 10:42:23,520
so unlike them.

39678
10:42:23,600 --> 10:42:24,620
Had you not been

39679
10:42:24,620 --> 10:42:25,800
really amiable,

39680
10:42:25,800 --> 10:42:26,720
you would have hated

39681
10:42:26,720 --> 10:42:27,180
for it.

39682
10:42:27,180 --> 10:42:27,780
But in spite

39683
10:42:27,780 --> 10:42:28,280
of the pains

39684
10:42:28,280 --> 10:42:28,640
you took

39685
10:42:28,640 --> 10:42:29,840
to disguise yourself,

39686
10:42:30,020 --> 10:42:30,720
your feelings

39687
10:42:30,720 --> 10:42:31,800
were always noble

39688
10:42:31,800 --> 10:42:32,880
and just.

39689
10:42:32,880 --> 10:42:33,920
And in your heart

39690
10:42:33,920 --> 10:42:35,120
you thoroughly despised

39691
10:42:35,120 --> 10:42:35,720
the persons

39692
10:42:35,720 --> 10:42:36,860
you so assiduously

39693
10:42:36,860 --> 10:42:38,060
courted you

39694
10:42:38,120 --> 10:42:39,540
that I have saved you

39695
10:42:39,540 --> 10:42:39,920
the trouble

39696
10:42:39,920 --> 10:42:41,120
of accounting for it.

39697
10:42:41,220 --> 10:42:41,880
And really,

39698
10:42:41,880 --> 10:42:42,920
all things considered,

39699
10:42:42,920 --> 10:42:43,560
I begin to think

39700
10:42:43,560 --> 10:42:44,220
it's perfectly

39701
10:42:44,220 --> 10:42:44,780
reasonable

39702
10:42:45,780 --> 10:42:46,580
to be sure

39703
10:42:46,580 --> 10:42:47,120
you knew no

39704
10:42:47,120 --> 10:42:48,320
actual good of me.

39705
10:42:48,320 --> 10:42:48,860
But nobody

39706
10:42:48,860 --> 10:42:49,680
thinks of that

39707
10:42:49,680 --> 10:42:50,880
when they fall in love.

39708
10:42:52,560 --> 10:42:52,940
Was there

39709
10:42:52,940 --> 10:42:53,460
no good

39710
10:42:53,460 --> 10:42:54,200
in your affectionate

39711
10:42:54,200 --> 10:42:55,100
behavior to Jane

39712
10:42:55,100 --> 10:42:55,680
while she was

39713
10:42:55,680 --> 10:42:56,880
ill at Netherfield?

39714
10:42:58,140 --> 10:42:59,340
Dearest Jane,

39715
10:42:59,600 --> 10:43:00,180
who could have done

39716
10:43:00,180 --> 10:43:01,380
less for her,

39717
10:43:01,500 --> 10:43:02,460
but to make a virtue

39718
10:43:02,460 --> 10:43:03,600
of it by all means.

39719
10:43:03,600 --> 10:43:04,640
My good qualities

39720
10:43:04,640 --> 10:43:04,940
are under

39721
10:43:04,940 --> 10:43:05,780
your protection.

39722
10:43:05,780 --> 10:43:07,280
And you are to them

39723
10:43:07,280 --> 10:43:08,480
as much as possible.

39724
10:43:08,780 --> 10:43:09,620
And in return,

39725
10:43:09,620 --> 10:43:10,400
it belongs to me

39726
10:43:10,400 --> 10:43:11,300
to find occasions

39727
10:43:11,300 --> 10:43:11,960
for teasing

39728
10:43:11,960 --> 10:43:12,800
and quarreling with you

39729
10:43:12,800 --> 10:43:14,000
as often as may be.

39730
10:43:14,300 --> 10:43:15,080
And I shall begin

39731
10:43:15,080 --> 10:43:16,820
directly by asking you

39732
10:43:16,860 --> 10:43:17,420
what made you

39733
10:43:17,420 --> 10:43:18,320
so unwilling

39734
10:43:18,320 --> 10:43:18,800
to come to the

39735
10:43:18,800 --> 10:43:20,000
point at last?

39736
10:43:20,060 --> 10:43:20,640
What made you

39737
10:43:20,640 --> 10:43:21,420
so shy of me

39738
10:43:21,420 --> 10:43:22,520
when you first called

39739
10:43:22,520 --> 10:43:23,280
and afterwards

39740
10:43:23,280 --> 10:43:24,440
dined here?

39741
10:43:24,440 --> 10:43:24,900
Why?

39742
10:43:24,900 --> 10:43:25,640
Especially when

39743
10:43:25,640 --> 10:43:26,360
you called

39744
10:43:26,360 --> 10:43:27,080
did, you look as if

39745
10:43:27,080 --> 10:43:27,480
you did not

39746
10:43:27,480 --> 10:43:28,340
care about me.

39747
10:43:30,140 --> 10:43:30,680
Because you were

39748
10:43:30,680 --> 10:43:31,560
grave and silent

39749
10:43:31,560 --> 10:43:31,980
and gave me

39750
10:43:31,980 --> 10:43:33,180
no encouragement.

39751
10:43:34,460 --> 10:43:35,700
But I was embarrassed.

39752
10:43:36,180 --> 10:43:37,380
And so was I.

39753
10:43:37,800 --> 10:43:38,360
You might have

39754
10:43:38,360 --> 10:43:38,900
talked to me

39755
10:43:38,900 --> 10:43:39,420
more when you

39756
10:43:39,420 --> 10:43:40,620
came to dinner.

39757
10:43:41,420 --> 10:43:41,840
A man

39758
10:43:41,840 --> 10:43:43,040
who had felt less might.

39759
10:43:44,280 --> 10:43:45,380
How unlucky?

39760
10:43:45,380 --> 10:43:45,980
That you should have

39761
10:43:45,980 --> 10:43:47,180
a reasonable answer

39762
10:43:47,180 --> 10:43:47,820
to give.

39763
10:43:47,820 --> 10:43:48,680
And that I should be

39764
10:43:48,680 --> 10:43:49,460
so reasonable

39765
10:43:49,460 --> 10:43:50,660
as to admit it.

39766
10:43:50,880 --> 10:43:52,020
But I wonder how long

39767
10:43:52,020 --> 10:43:53,220
you would have gone on

39768
10:43:53,220 --> 10:43:53,760
if you had been

39769
10:43:53,760 --> 10:43:54,960
left to yourself.

39770
10:43:55,040 --> 10:43:56,060
I wonder when you would

39771
10:43:56,060 --> 10:43:56,600
have spoken

39772
10:43:56,600 --> 10:43:57,980
if I had not asked you.

39773
10:43:58,440 --> 10:43:59,400
My resolution

39774
10:43:59,400 --> 10:44:00,120
of thanking you

39775
10:44:00,120 --> 10:44:00,380
for your.

39776
10:44:00,380 --> 10:44:01,040
Kindness to.

39777
10:44:01,040 --> 10:44:02,100
Lydia had certainly

39778
10:44:02,100 --> 10:44:03,300
great effect.

39779
10:44:03,320 --> 10:44:04,100
Too much,

39780
10:44:04,100 --> 10:44:05,580
I am afraid for what

39781
10:44:05,580 --> 10:44:06,660
becomes of the morale

39782
10:44:06,660 --> 10:44:07,380
of our comforts

39783
10:44:07,380 --> 10:44:07,800
springs

39784
10:44:07,800 --> 10:44:08,000
from a

39785
10:44:08,000 --> 10:44:09,200
breach of promise.

39786
10:44:09,360 --> 10:44:10,140
For I ought not

39787
10:44:10,140 --> 10:44:10,740
to have mentioned

39788
10:44:10,740 --> 10:44:11,700
the subject.

39789
10:44:11,700 --> 10:44:13,160
This will never do.

39790
10:44:14,300 --> 10:44:14,880
You not

39791
10:44:14,880 --> 10:44:15,900
distress yourself.

39792
10:44:15,900 --> 10:44:16,620
The moral will be

39793
10:44:16,620 --> 10:44:17,820
perfectly fair.

39794
10:44:17,940 --> 10:44:18,780
Lady Katherine's

39795
10:44:18,780 --> 10:44:20,180
unjustifiable endeavors

39796
10:44:20,180 --> 10:44:21,440
to separate us were

39797
10:44:21,460 --> 10:44:22,340
the means of removing

39798
10:44:22,340 --> 10:44:23,540
all my doubts.

39799
10:44:23,580 --> 10:44:24,600
I am not indebted for

39800
10:44:24,600 --> 10:44:25,800
my present happiness

39801
10:44:25,880 --> 10:44:26,900
to your eager desire

39802
10:44:26,900 --> 10:44:27,500
of expressing

39803
10:44:27,500 --> 10:44:28,700
your gratitude.

39804
10:44:28,820 --> 10:44:29,820
I was not in the humor

39805
10:44:29,820 --> 10:44:30,240
to wait

39806
10:44:30,240 --> 10:44:31,440
for an opening of yours.

39807
10:44:31,620 --> 10:44:32,720
My aunt's intelligence

39808
10:44:32,720 --> 10:44:33,900
had given me hope,

39809
10:44:33,900 --> 10:44:34,880
and I was determined

39810
10:44:34,880 --> 10:44:35,280
at once

39811
10:44:35,280 --> 10:44:36,480
to know everything.

39812
10:44:37,460 --> 10:44:38,280
Lady Katherine

39813
10:44:38,280 --> 10:44:38,880
has been of

39814
10:44:38,880 --> 10:44:39,780
infinite use,

39815
10:44:39,780 --> 10:44:40,320
which ought to

39816
10:44:40,320 --> 10:44:41,240
make her happy.

39817
10:44:41,240 --> 10:44:42,080
Who she loves

39818
10:44:42,080 --> 10:44:43,260
to be of use.

39819
10:44:43,260 --> 10:44:44,100
But to tell me.

39820
10:44:44,100 --> 10:44:44,960
What did you come down

39821
10:44:44,960 --> 10:44:46,080
to Netherfield for?

39822
10:44:46,080 --> 10:44:47,180
Was it merely to ride

39823
10:44:47,180 --> 10:44:47,780
along, born

39824
10:44:47,780 --> 10:44:48,840
and be embarrassed?

39825
10:44:48,840 --> 10:44:49,220
Or had

39826
10:44:49,220 --> 10:44:49,760
you intended

39827
10:44:49,760 --> 10:44:50,180
any more

39828
10:44:50,180 --> 10:44:51,380
serious consequence?

39829
10:44:53,220 --> 10:44:54,300
My real purpose

39830
10:44:54,300 --> 10:44:55,320
to see you

39831
10:44:55,320 --> 10:44:56,040
and to judge,

39832
10:44:56,040 --> 10:44:57,420
if I could, whether

39833
10:44:57,420 --> 10:44:58,200
I might ever hope

39834
10:44:58,200 --> 10:44:59,000
to make you love me,

39835
10:45:00,600 --> 10:45:01,760
my avowed one

39836
10:45:01,760 --> 10:45:02,660
or what I have vowed to

39837
10:45:02,660 --> 10:45:03,860
myself

39838
10:45:04,280 --> 10:45:04,800
was to see

39839
10:45:04,800 --> 10:45:05,480
whether your sister

39840
10:45:05,480 --> 10:45:05,880
was still

39841
10:45:05,880 --> 10:45:07,080
partial to Bingley

39842
10:45:07,200 --> 10:45:08,340
and if she were

39843
10:45:08,340 --> 10:45:08,640
to make

39844
10:45:08,640 --> 10:45:09,620
the confession to him,

39845
10:45:09,620 --> 10:45:10,820
which I have since made.

39846
10:45:12,060 --> 10:45:12,380
Shall

39847
10:45:12,380 --> 10:45:13,580
you ever have courage

39848
10:45:13,580 --> 10:45:14,040
announce to.

39849
10:45:14,040 --> 10:45:14,760
Lady Katherine.

39850
10:45:14,760 --> 10:45:15,960
What is to befall her?

39851
10:45:17,040 --> 10:45:17,900
I am more likely

39852
10:45:17,900 --> 10:45:18,260
to want

39853
10:45:18,260 --> 10:45:18,840
time than

39854
10:45:18,840 --> 10:45:20,040
courage, Elizabeth.

39855
10:45:20,180 --> 10:45:21,380
But it ought to be done.

39856
10:45:21,560 --> 10:45:22,080
And if you will

39857
10:45:22,080 --> 10:45:22,680
give me a sheet

39858
10:45:22,680 --> 10:45:23,100
of paper,

39859
10:45:23,100 --> 10:45:23,580
it shall be

39860
10:45:23,580 --> 10:45:24,780
done directly.

39861
10:45:25,320 --> 10:45:26,180
And if I had not

39862
10:45:26,180 --> 10:45:26,480
a letter

39863
10:45:26,480 --> 10:45:27,600
to write myself,

39864
10:45:27,600 --> 10:45:28,380
I might sit.

39865
10:45:28,380 --> 10:45:28,820
By you

39866
10:45:28,820 --> 10:45:30,000
and admire the evenness.

39867
10:45:30,000 --> 10:45:30,840
Of your writing.

39868
10:45:30,840 --> 10:45:31,820
As another young lady

39869
10:45:31,820 --> 10:45:32,960
once did.

39870
10:45:32,960 --> 10:45:34,340
But I have an aunt, too,

39871
10:45:34,380 --> 10:45:35,580
who must not be longer

39872
10:45:35,580 --> 10:45:36,780
neglected.

39873
10:45:37,280 --> 10:45:38,220
From an unwillingness

39874
10:45:38,220 --> 10:45:38,760
to confess

39875
10:45:38,760 --> 10:45:39,780
how much her intimacy

39876
10:45:39,780 --> 10:45:40,200
with Mr.

39877
10:45:40,200 --> 10:45:40,760
Darcy had

39878
10:45:40,760 --> 10:45:41,840
been overrated.

39879
10:45:41,840 --> 10:45:43,040
Elizabeth had never yet

39880
10:45:43,040 --> 10:45:43,700
answered Mrs.

39881
10:45:43,700 --> 10:45:44,900
Gardner's long letter,

39882
10:45:45,260 --> 10:45:46,320
but now having

39883
10:45:46,320 --> 10:45:46,700
that to

39884
10:45:46,700 --> 10:45:47,420
communicate, which.

39885
10:45:47,420 --> 10:45:47,760
She knew

39886
10:45:47,760 --> 10:45:48,960
would be most welcome,

39887
10:45:48,960 --> 10:45:49,280
she was.

39888
10:45:49,280 --> 10:45:50,580
Almost ashamed to find

39889
10:45:50,580 --> 10:45:51,140
that her uncle

39890
10:45:51,140 --> 10:45:51,600
and aunt

39891
10:45:51,600 --> 10:45:52,400
had already lost

39892
10:45:52,400 --> 10:45:53,700
three days of happiness

39893
10:45:54,000 --> 10:45:54,560
and immediately

39894
10:45:54,560 --> 10:45:55,760
wrote as follows.

39895
10:45:56,240 --> 10:45:57,080
I would have thanked you

39896
10:45:57,080 --> 10:45:58,400
before, my dear aunt,

39897
10:45:58,520 --> 10:45:59,720
as I ought to have done

39898
10:45:59,880 --> 10:46:01,040
for your long kind,

39899
10:46:01,040 --> 10:46:02,280
satisfactory detail

39900
10:46:02,280 --> 10:46:03,420
of particulars.

39901
10:46:03,420 --> 10:46:04,340
But to say the truth,

39902
10:46:04,340 --> 10:46:04,820
I was too

39903
10:46:04,820 --> 10:46:06,020
cross to write.

39904
10:46:06,080 --> 10:46:06,900
You supposed

39905
10:46:06,900 --> 10:46:08,220
more than Mary existed.

39906
10:46:08,660 --> 10:46:09,740
But now, suppose

39907
10:46:09,740 --> 10:46:10,940
as much as you choose.

39908
10:46:11,120 --> 10:46:11,840
Give a loose

39909
10:46:11,840 --> 10:46:13,100
rein to your fancy.

39910
10:46:13,220 --> 10:46:14,640
Indulge your imagination

39911
10:46:14,640 --> 10:46:16,160
in every possible flight

39912
10:46:16,160 --> 10:46:16,460
which the

39913
10:46:16,460 --> 10:46:17,660
subject will afford.

39914
10:46:17,880 --> 10:46:18,480
And unless

39915
10:46:18,480 --> 10:46:19,040
you believe me,

39916
10:46:19,040 --> 10:46:20,180
actually married,

39917
10:46:20,180 --> 10:46:21,200
you cannot greatly.

39918
10:46:21,200 --> 10:46:22,040
Ah.

39919
10:46:22,040 --> 10:46:22,980
You must write again

39920
10:46:22,980 --> 10:46:23,720
very soon

39921
10:46:23,720 --> 10:46:24,380
and praise him

39922
10:46:24,380 --> 10:46:25,080
a great deal

39923
10:46:25,080 --> 10:46:25,680
more than you did

39924
10:46:25,680 --> 10:46:26,720
on your last.

39925
10:46:26,720 --> 10:46:27,900
I thank you again

39926
10:46:27,900 --> 10:46:28,400
and again

39927
10:46:28,400 --> 10:46:29,180
for not going

39928
10:46:29,180 --> 10:46:29,960
to the lakes.

39929
10:46:29,960 --> 10:46:31,100
How could I be so silly

39930
10:46:31,100 --> 10:46:32,120
as to wish it?

39931
10:46:32,120 --> 10:46:33,260
Your idea of the ponies

39932
10:46:33,260 --> 10:46:34,100
is delightful.

39933
10:46:34,100 --> 10:46:34,680
We will go

39934
10:46:34,680 --> 10:46:35,360
round the park

39935
10:46:35,360 --> 10:46:36,560
every day.

39936
10:46:36,860 --> 10:46:37,920
I am the happiest

39937
10:46:37,920 --> 10:46:39,120
creature in the world.

39938
10:46:39,360 --> 10:46:40,440
Perhaps other people

39939
10:46:40,440 --> 10:46:41,640
have said so before,

39940
10:46:41,720 --> 10:46:42,780
but not one with

39941
10:46:42,780 --> 10:46:43,980
such justice.

39942
10:46:44,420 --> 10:46:45,140
I am happier

39943
10:46:45,140 --> 10:46:46,160
even than Jane.

39944
10:46:46,160 --> 10:46:47,580
She only smiles.

39945
10:46:47,760 --> 10:46:48,960
I laugh.

39946
10:46:49,320 --> 10:46:49,640
Mr.

39947
10:46:49,640 --> 10:46:50,420
Darcy send you.

39948
10:46:50,420 --> 10:46:51,000
All the love

39949
10:46:51,000 --> 10:46:51,420
in the world

39950
10:46:51,420 --> 10:46:51,740
that he can

39951
10:46:51,740 --> 10:46:52,820
spare for me.

39952
10:46:52,820 --> 10:46:53,640
You are all to come

39953
10:46:53,640 --> 10:46:54,140
to Pemberley

39954
10:46:54,140 --> 10:46:55,280
at Christmas.

39955
10:46:55,280 --> 10:46:56,480
Yours, etc..

39956
10:46:56,880 --> 10:46:57,180
Mr.

39957
10:46:57,180 --> 10:46:58,280
Darcy's letter to Lady

39958
10:46:58,280 --> 10:46:58,920
Katherine was in

39959
10:46:58,920 --> 10:46:59,960
a different style

39960
10:46:59,960 --> 10:47:00,980
and still different from

39961
10:47:00,980 --> 10:47:02,000
either was what Mr.

39962
10:47:02,000 --> 10:47:02,880
Bennett to Mr.

39963
10:47:02,880 --> 10:47:04,200
Collins in reply to

39964
10:47:04,200 --> 10:47:04,760
his last

39965
10:47:06,060 --> 10:47:07,260
Dear sir.

39966
10:47:07,620 --> 10:47:08,340
I must trouble you

39967
10:47:08,340 --> 10:47:08,820
once more

39968
10:47:08,820 --> 10:47:10,020
for congratulations.

39969
10:47:10,800 --> 10:47:11,360
Elizabeth

39970
10:47:11,360 --> 10:47:11,960
will soon be

39971
10:47:11,960 --> 10:47:12,840
the wife of Mr.

39972
10:47:12,840 --> 10:47:14,760
Darcy console Lady

39973
10:47:14,760 --> 10:47:15,180
Katherine

39974
10:47:15,180 --> 10:47:16,380
as well as you can.

39975
10:47:16,620 --> 10:47:17,720
But if I were you,

39976
10:47:17,720 --> 10:47:18,440
I would stand

39977
10:47:18,440 --> 10:47:19,500
by the nephew.

39978
10:47:19,500 --> 10:47:20,700
He has more to give

39979
10:47:20,880 --> 10:47:22,080
your sincerely,

39980
10:47:22,160 --> 10:47:23,360
etc..

39981
10:47:23,700 --> 10:47:24,360
Miss Bingley

39982
10:47:24,360 --> 10:47:25,280
is congratulations

39983
10:47:25,280 --> 10:47:25,980
to her brother

39984
10:47:25,980 --> 10:47:26,700
on his approaching

39985
10:47:26,700 --> 10:47:27,360
marriage.

39986
10:47:27,360 --> 10:47:27,800
Were all

39987
10:47:27,800 --> 10:47:28,680
that was affectionate

39988
10:47:28,680 --> 10:47:29,880
and insincere.

39989
10:47:30,120 --> 10:47:31,020
She wrote even to

39990
10:47:31,020 --> 10:47:32,220
Jane on the

39991
10:47:32,220 --> 10:47:33,420
to express her delight

39992
10:47:33,560 --> 10:47:34,160
and repeat

39993
10:47:34,160 --> 10:47:34,860
all her former

39994
10:47:34,860 --> 10:47:36,060
professions of regard.

39995
10:47:36,440 --> 10:47:37,160
Jane was not.

39996
10:47:37,160 --> 10:47:37,860
Deceived,

39997
10:47:37,860 --> 10:47:39,120
but she was affected.

39998
10:47:39,380 --> 10:47:40,400
And though feeling no

39999
10:47:40,400 --> 10:47:41,600
reliance on her.

40000
10:47:41,640 --> 10:47:42,020
Could not.

40001
10:47:42,020 --> 10:47:42,680
Help writing her

40002
10:47:42,680 --> 10:47:43,340
a much kinder

40003
10:47:43,340 --> 10:47:44,280
answer than she knew

40004
10:47:44,280 --> 10:47:45,480
was deserved.

40005
10:47:45,480 --> 10:47:46,440
The joy which Mr.

40006
10:47:46,440 --> 10:47:47,400
Darcy expressed

40007
10:47:47,400 --> 10:47:47,940
on receiving

40008
10:47:47,940 --> 10:47:49,340
similar information was

40009
10:47:49,340 --> 10:47:50,100
as sincere

40010
10:47:50,100 --> 10:47:50,760
as her brother's

40011
10:47:50,760 --> 10:47:51,860
and sending.

40012
10:47:51,860 --> 10:47:53,220
Four sides of paper

40013
10:47:53,220 --> 10:47:53,960
were insufficient

40014
10:47:53,960 --> 10:47:54,500
to contain

40015
10:47:54,500 --> 10:47:55,440
all her delight

40016
10:47:55,440 --> 10:47:55,920
and all her

40017
10:47:55,920 --> 10:47:57,200
earnest desire of being

40018
10:47:57,200 --> 10:47:58,380
loved by her sister

40019
10:47:59,340 --> 10:47:59,960
before any

40020
10:47:59,960 --> 10:48:00,440
answer could

40021
10:48:00,440 --> 10:48:01,160
arrive from Mr.

40022
10:48:01,160 --> 10:48:01,860
Collins

40023
10:48:01,860 --> 10:48:03,060
or any congratulations

40024
10:48:03,060 --> 10:48:03,620
to Elizabeth

40025
10:48:03,620 --> 10:48:04,620
from his wife.

40026
10:48:04,620 --> 10:48:05,720
The long born family

40027
10:48:05,720 --> 10:48:06,720
heard that the Collins's

40028
10:48:06,720 --> 10:48:07,620
were coming themselves

40029
10:48:07,620 --> 10:48:08,780
to Lucas Lodge.

40030
10:48:08,780 --> 10:48:09,780
The reason of the sudden

40031
10:48:09,780 --> 10:48:10,160
removal

40032
10:48:10,160 --> 10:48:11,340
was soon evident.

40033
10:48:11,340 --> 10:48:12,140
Lady Katherine

40034
10:48:12,140 --> 10:48:12,780
had been rendered

40035
10:48:12,780 --> 10:48:13,980
so exceedingly angry

40036
10:48:13,980 --> 10:48:14,660
by the contents

40037
10:48:14,660 --> 10:48:15,840
of her nephew's letter

40038
10:48:15,840 --> 10:48:17,100
that Charlotte, really

40039
10:48:17,100 --> 10:48:18,260
rejoicing in the match,

40040
10:48:18,260 --> 10:48:19,460
was anxious to get away

40041
10:48:19,460 --> 10:48:20,060
till the storm

40042
10:48:20,060 --> 10:48:21,240
was blown over.

40043
10:48:21,240 --> 10:48:22,100
At such a moment,

40044
10:48:22,100 --> 10:48:22,700
the arrival of

40045
10:48:22,700 --> 10:48:23,760
her friend was a sincere

40046
10:48:23,760 --> 10:48:24,960
pleasure to Elizabeth.

40047
10:48:25,140 --> 10:48:25,820
Though in the course

40048
10:48:25,820 --> 10:48:26,420
of their meeting,

40049
10:48:26,420 --> 10:48:27,360
she must sometimes

40050
10:48:27,360 --> 10:48:28,040
think the pleasure

40051
10:48:28,040 --> 10:48:28,980
dearly bought

40052
10:48:28,980 --> 10:48:30,000
when she saw Mr.

40053
10:48:30,000 --> 10:48:30,980
Darcy

40054
10:48:30,980 --> 10:48:31,940
to all the parading

40055
10:48:31,940 --> 10:48:32,780
and obsequious

40056
10:48:32,780 --> 10:48:34,100
civility of her husband.

40057
10:48:34,560 --> 10:48:35,540
He bought, however,

40058
10:48:35,540 --> 10:48:36,840
with admirable calmness.

40059
10:48:37,160 --> 10:48:38,120
He could even listen

40060
10:48:38,120 --> 10:48:39,300
to Sir William Lucas

40061
10:48:39,300 --> 10:48:40,320
when he complimented him

40062
10:48:40,320 --> 10:48:41,100
on carrying away

40063
10:48:41,100 --> 10:48:41,900
the brightest jewel

40064
10:48:41,900 --> 10:48:42,740
of the country

40065
10:48:42,740 --> 10:48:43,860
and expressed his hopes

40066
10:48:43,860 --> 10:48:44,580
of their all meeting

40067
10:48:44,580 --> 10:48:45,980
frequently at St James's

40068
10:48:46,260 --> 10:48:46,700
with very

40069
10:48:46,700 --> 10:48:47,900
decent composure.

40070
10:48:48,080 --> 10:48:48,960
If he did shrugged

40071
10:48:48,960 --> 10:48:49,640
his shoulders.

40072
10:48:49,640 --> 10:48:50,200
It was not

40073
10:48:50,200 --> 10:48:50,540
until Sir

40074
10:48:50,540 --> 10:48:51,020
William was

40075
10:48:51,020 --> 10:48:52,220
out of sight.

40076
10:48:52,580 --> 10:48:52,940
Mrs.

40077
10:48:52,940 --> 10:48:53,960
Phillips's vulgarity

40078
10:48:53,960 --> 10:48:54,560
was another,

40079
10:48:54,560 --> 10:48:55,140
and perhaps

40080
10:48:55,140 --> 10:48:56,040
a greater tax

40081
10:48:56,040 --> 10:48:57,200
on his forbearance.

40082
10:48:57,200 --> 10:48:57,980
And though Mrs.

40083
10:48:57,980 --> 10:48:58,440
Phillips,

40084
10:48:58,440 --> 10:48:59,640
as well as her sister,

40085
10:48:59,660 --> 10:49:01,040
stood in too much of him

40086
10:49:01,040 --> 10:49:01,520
to speak with

40087
10:49:01,520 --> 10:49:02,340
the familiarity

40088
10:49:02,340 --> 10:49:03,140
which Bayley's good

40089
10:49:03,140 --> 10:49:04,340
humor encouraged.

40090
10:49:04,380 --> 10:49:05,040
Yet whenever

40091
10:49:05,040 --> 10:49:06,000
she did speak,

40092
10:49:06,000 --> 10:49:07,340
she must be vulgar.

40093
10:49:07,800 --> 10:49:08,880
Nor was her respect

40094
10:49:08,880 --> 10:49:09,560
for him, though

40095
10:49:09,560 --> 10:49:10,760
it made more quiet

40096
10:49:10,820 --> 10:49:11,640
at all, likely

40097
10:49:11,640 --> 10:49:12,060
to make her

40098
10:49:12,060 --> 10:49:13,260
more elegant.

40099
10:49:13,260 --> 10:49:14,060
Elizabeth did

40100
10:49:14,060 --> 10:49:14,700
all she could

40101
10:49:14,700 --> 10:49:15,300
to shield him

40102
10:49:15,300 --> 10:49:15,980
from the frequent

40103
10:49:15,980 --> 10:49:17,100
notice of either

40104
10:49:17,100 --> 10:49:18,120
and was ever anxious

40105
10:49:18,120 --> 10:49:19,320
to keep him to herself

40106
10:49:19,520 --> 10:49:20,760
and those of her family

40107
10:49:20,760 --> 10:49:21,020
with whom

40108
10:49:21,020 --> 10:49:21,800
he might converse

40109
10:49:21,800 --> 10:49:23,000
without mortification.

40110
10:49:23,280 --> 10:49:23,760
And though

40111
10:49:23,760 --> 10:49:24,440
the uncomfortable

40112
10:49:24,440 --> 10:49:25,380
feelings arising

40113
10:49:25,380 --> 10:49:25,740
from all

40114
10:49:25,740 --> 10:49:26,360
this took from

40115
10:49:26,360 --> 10:49:27,360
the season of courtship,

40116
10:49:27,360 --> 10:49:28,560
much of its pleasure,

40117
10:49:28,580 --> 10:49:29,280
it added to

40118
10:49:29,280 --> 10:49:30,480
the hope of the future.

40119
10:49:30,720 --> 10:49:31,640
And she looked forward

40120
10:49:31,640 --> 10:49:32,840
with delight to the time

40121
10:49:33,000 --> 10:49:33,560
when they should be

40122
10:49:33,560 --> 10:49:34,660
removed from society.

40123
10:49:34,660 --> 10:49:35,100
So little

40124
10:49:35,100 --> 10:49:36,300
pleasing to either

40125
10:49:36,320 --> 10:49:37,320
to all the comfort

40126
10:49:37,320 --> 10:49:38,040
and elegance

40127
10:49:38,040 --> 10:49:38,760
of their family

40128
10:49:38,760 --> 10:49:40,220
party at Pemberley.

40129
10:49:42,020 --> 10:49:43,320
Chapter 61.

40130
10:49:44,240 --> 10:49:45,020
Happy for

40131
10:49:45,020 --> 10:49:45,500
all her

40132
10:49:45,500 --> 10:49:46,500
maternal feelings

40133
10:49:46,500 --> 10:49:47,120
was the day

40134
10:49:47,120 --> 10:49:47,900
on which Mrs.

40135
10:49:47,900 --> 10:49:49,100
Bennett got rid of

40136
10:49:49,140 --> 10:49:49,880
two most

40137
10:49:49,880 --> 10:49:51,140
deserving daughters.

40138
10:49:51,620 --> 10:49:51,860
With.

40139
10:49:51,860 --> 10:49:53,340
What delighted pride.

40140
10:49:53,340 --> 10:49:54,140
She afterwards

40141
10:49:54,140 --> 10:49:54,860
visited Mrs.

40142
10:49:54,860 --> 10:49:55,620
Bingley

40143
10:49:55,620 --> 10:49:56,640
and talked of Mrs..

40144
10:49:56,640 --> 10:49:58,500
Darcy may be guessed.

40145
10:49:58,980 --> 10:49:59,720
I wish I could.

40146
10:49:59,720 --> 10:50:00,420
Say for the

40147
10:50:00,420 --> 10:50:01,620
sake of her family

40148
10:50:01,640 --> 10:50:02,780
that the accomplishment

40149
10:50:02,780 --> 10:50:04,020
of her earnest desire

40150
10:50:04,020 --> 10:50:04,940
in the establishment

40151
10:50:04,940 --> 10:50:05,280
of so

40152
10:50:05,280 --> 10:50:06,480
many of her children

40153
10:50:06,620 --> 10:50:07,760
produced so happy,

40154
10:50:07,760 --> 10:50:09,020
in effect, to make her

40155
10:50:09,020 --> 10:50:10,680
a sensible, amiable,

40156
10:50:10,800 --> 10:50:12,080
well-informed woman

40157
10:50:12,080 --> 10:50:12,800
for the rest of her

40158
10:50:12,800 --> 10:50:13,640
life.

40159
10:50:13,640 --> 10:50:14,420
Though perhaps

40160
10:50:14,420 --> 10:50:15,000
it was lucky

40161
10:50:15,000 --> 10:50:16,160
for her husband,

40162
10:50:16,160 --> 10:50:16,820
who might not

40163
10:50:16,820 --> 10:50:17,400
have relished

40164
10:50:17,400 --> 10:50:18,600
domestic Felicity in

40165
10:50:18,600 --> 10:50:19,820
so unusual a form

40166
10:50:20,100 --> 10:50:20,960
that she was still

40167
10:50:20,960 --> 10:50:22,200
occasionally nervous

40168
10:50:22,200 --> 10:50:23,640
and invariably silly.

40169
10:50:24,480 --> 10:50:24,860
Mr.

40170
10:50:24,860 --> 10:50:25,520
Bennett missed

40171
10:50:25,520 --> 10:50:26,040
his second

40172
10:50:26,040 --> 10:50:27,240
daughter exceedingly.

40173
10:50:27,420 --> 10:50:28,560
His affection for her

40174
10:50:28,560 --> 10:50:29,420
drew him oftener

40175
10:50:29,420 --> 10:50:29,940
from home

40176
10:50:29,940 --> 10:50:30,780
than anything else

40177
10:50:30,780 --> 10:50:31,740
could do.

40178
10:50:31,740 --> 10:50:32,460
He delighted

40179
10:50:32,460 --> 10:50:33,660
in going to Pemberley,

40180
10:50:33,720 --> 10:50:34,760
especially when he

40181
10:50:34,760 --> 10:50:36,080
was least expected.

40182
10:50:36,900 --> 10:50:37,260
Mr.

40183
10:50:37,260 --> 10:50:38,460
Bingley and Jane

40184
10:50:38,580 --> 10:50:39,360
at Netherfield,

40185
10:50:39,360 --> 10:50:40,560
only a 12 month.

40186
10:50:40,740 --> 10:50:41,420
So near

40187
10:50:41,420 --> 10:50:42,260
vicinity to her

40188
10:50:42,260 --> 10:50:42,740
mother and

40189
10:50:42,740 --> 10:50:43,940
Meriton relations.

40190
10:50:44,000 --> 10:50:44,480
Was not.

40191
10:50:44,480 --> 10:50:45,120
Desirable

40192
10:50:45,120 --> 10:50:46,740
even to his easy temper

40193
10:50:46,920 --> 10:50:48,560
or her affection heart.

40194
10:50:49,040 --> 10:50:49,680
The darling

40195
10:50:49,680 --> 10:50:50,660
wish of his sisters

40196
10:50:50,660 --> 10:50:51,860
was then gratified.

40197
10:50:52,040 --> 10:50:53,180
He bought an estate

40198
10:50:53,180 --> 10:50:54,200
in a neighboring county

40199
10:50:54,200 --> 10:50:55,220
to Derbyshire.

40200
10:50:55,220 --> 10:50:56,700
And Jane and Elizabeth,

40201
10:50:56,880 --> 10:50:57,480
in addition

40202
10:50:57,480 --> 10:50:58,080
to every

40203
10:50:58,080 --> 10:50:59,220
source of happiness,

40204
10:50:59,220 --> 10:51:00,140
were within 30

40205
10:51:00,140 --> 10:51:01,340
miles of each other.

40206
10:51:01,580 --> 10:51:02,720
Kitty to her very

40207
10:51:02,720 --> 10:51:03,920
material advantage.

40208
10:51:04,080 --> 10:51:04,880
Spend the chief

40209
10:51:04,880 --> 10:51:05,660
of her time with her

40210
10:51:05,660 --> 10:51:06,860
two elder sisters

40211
10:51:07,160 --> 10:51:08,100
in society

40212
10:51:08,100 --> 10:51:08,880
so superior

40213
10:51:08,880 --> 10:51:09,500
to what she had

40214
10:51:09,500 --> 10:51:10,680
generally known.

40215
10:51:10,680 --> 10:51:11,480
Her improvement

40216
10:51:11,480 --> 10:51:12,480
was great.

40217
10:51:12,480 --> 10:51:13,280
She was not of.

40218
10:51:13,280 --> 10:51:14,220
So ungovernable

40219
10:51:14,220 --> 10:51:15,420
a temper as Lydia,

40220
10:51:15,600 --> 10:51:16,260
and removed

40221
10:51:16,260 --> 10:51:17,060
from the influence

40222
10:51:17,060 --> 10:51:18,260
of Lydia's example,

40223
10:51:18,480 --> 10:51:20,060
she became by proper

40224
10:51:20,060 --> 10:51:20,600
attention

40225
10:51:20,600 --> 10:51:21,660
and management,

40226
10:51:21,660 --> 10:51:22,680
less irritable,

40227
10:51:22,680 --> 10:51:23,600
less ignorant,

40228
10:51:23,600 --> 10:51:25,020
and less insipid

40229
10:51:25,260 --> 10:51:25,580
from the

40230
10:51:25,580 --> 10:51:26,720
further disadvantage

40231
10:51:26,720 --> 10:51:27,900
of Lydia society.

40232
10:51:27,900 --> 10:51:28,740
She, of course,

40233
10:51:28,740 --> 10:51:29,900
carefully kept,

40234
10:51:29,900 --> 10:51:30,800
and though Mrs.

40235
10:51:30,800 --> 10:51:31,740
Wickham frequently

40236
10:51:31,740 --> 10:51:32,300
invited her

40237
10:51:32,300 --> 10:51:33,000
to come and stay

40238
10:51:33,000 --> 10:51:33,540
with her

40239
10:51:33,540 --> 10:51:34,320
with the promise

40240
10:51:34,320 --> 10:51:35,720
of balls and young men,

40241
10:51:36,000 --> 10:51:36,980
her father would never

40242
10:51:36,980 --> 10:51:38,340
consent to her going.

40243
10:51:39,360 --> 10:51:40,040
Mary was the

40244
10:51:40,040 --> 10:51:40,800
only daughter

40245
10:51:40,800 --> 10:51:42,000
who remained at home,

40246
10:51:42,060 --> 10:51:43,280
and she was necessarily

40247
10:51:43,280 --> 10:51:43,620
drawn

40248
10:51:43,620 --> 10:51:44,240
from the pursuit

40249
10:51:44,240 --> 10:51:45,360
of accomplishments

40250
10:51:45,360 --> 10:51:45,860
by Mrs.

40251
10:51:45,860 --> 10:51:46,340
Bennett's

40252
10:51:46,340 --> 10:51:47,340
being quite unable

40253
10:51:47,340 --> 10:51:48,540
to sit alone.

40254
10:51:48,620 --> 10:51:49,640
Mary was obliged

40255
10:51:49,640 --> 10:51:50,060
to mix

40256
10:51:50,060 --> 10:51:51,480
more with the world, but

40257
10:51:51,480 --> 10:51:52,080
she could still

40258
10:51:52,080 --> 10:51:52,980
moralize over

40259
10:51:52,980 --> 10:51:54,180
every morning visit,

40260
10:51:54,240 --> 10:51:55,460
and as she was no longer

40261
10:51:55,460 --> 10:51:56,940
mortified by comparisons

40262
10:51:56,940 --> 10:51:58,140
between her sister's

40263
10:51:58,200 --> 10:51:59,120
and her own.

40264
10:51:59,120 --> 10:51:59,480
It was.

40265
10:51:59,480 --> 10:52:00,920
Suspected by her father

40266
10:52:01,100 --> 10:52:01,980
that she submitted

40267
10:52:01,980 --> 10:52:02,700
to the change

40268
10:52:02,700 --> 10:52:03,380
without much.

40269
10:52:03,380 --> 10:52:04,580
Reluctance.

40270
10:52:04,920 --> 10:52:05,840
As for Wickham

40271
10:52:05,840 --> 10:52:06,740
and Lydia,

40272
10:52:06,740 --> 10:52:07,560
their character

40273
10:52:07,560 --> 10:52:08,880
suffered, no revolution

40274
10:52:08,880 --> 10:52:09,500
from the marriage

40275
10:52:09,500 --> 10:52:10,700
of her sisters.

40276
10:52:10,740 --> 10:52:12,080
He bore with philosophy

40277
10:52:12,080 --> 10:52:12,720
the conviction

40278
10:52:12,720 --> 10:52:13,920
that Elizabeth must now

40279
10:52:13,920 --> 10:52:15,180
become acquainted with

40280
10:52:15,180 --> 10:52:15,600
whatever

40281
10:52:15,600 --> 10:52:16,620
of his ingratitude

40282
10:52:16,620 --> 10:52:17,820
and falsehood had before

40283
10:52:17,820 --> 10:52:19,020
been unknown to her,

40284
10:52:19,080 --> 10:52:19,400
and in

40285
10:52:19,400 --> 10:52:20,480
spite of everything,

40286
10:52:20,480 --> 10:52:21,660
was not wholly without

40287
10:52:21,660 --> 10:52:22,920
hope that Darcy might

40288
10:52:22,980 --> 10:52:23,760
had to be prevailed

40289
10:52:23,760 --> 10:52:25,080
on to make his fortune.

40290
10:52:25,680 --> 10:52:26,660
The congratulatory

40291
10:52:26,660 --> 10:52:27,860
letter which Elizabeth

40292
10:52:27,900 --> 10:52:28,460
from Lydia

40293
10:52:28,460 --> 10:52:29,520
and her marriage,

40294
10:52:29,520 --> 10:52:30,420
explained to her

40295
10:52:30,420 --> 10:52:31,820
that by his wife,

40296
10:52:31,820 --> 10:52:32,540
at least.

40297
10:52:32,540 --> 10:52:33,780
If not by himself,

40298
10:52:34,040 --> 10:52:34,760
such a hope

40299
10:52:34,760 --> 10:52:35,880
was cherished.

40300
10:52:35,880 --> 10:52:36,800
The letter was to

40301
10:52:36,800 --> 10:52:37,500
this effect.

40302
10:52:38,460 --> 10:52:39,660
My dear Lizzie,

40303
10:52:39,720 --> 10:52:40,920
I wish you joy.

40304
10:52:41,040 --> 10:52:41,680
If you love.

40305
10:52:41,680 --> 10:52:41,960
Mr.

40306
10:52:41,960 --> 10:52:42,780
Darcy half

40307
10:52:42,780 --> 10:52:43,580
as well as I do.

40308
10:52:43,580 --> 10:52:44,700
My dear Wickham,

40309
10:52:44,700 --> 10:52:46,160
you must be very happy.

40310
10:52:46,520 --> 10:52:47,580
It is a great comfort

40311
10:52:47,580 --> 10:52:48,780
to have you so rich.

40312
10:52:48,780 --> 10:52:49,260
And when you

40313
10:52:49,260 --> 10:52:50,460
have nothing else to do,

40314
10:52:50,520 --> 10:52:50,900
I hope

40315
10:52:50,900 --> 10:52:52,100
you will think of us.

40316
10:52:52,140 --> 10:52:53,120
I am sure Wickham

40317
10:52:53,120 --> 10:52:53,760
would like a place

40318
10:52:53,760 --> 10:52:54,860
at court very much.

40319
10:52:54,860 --> 10:52:55,640
And I do not think

40320
10:52:55,640 --> 10:52:55,980
we shall have

40321
10:52:55,980 --> 10:52:56,820
quite money enough

40322
10:52:56,820 --> 10:52:57,540
to live upon.

40323
10:52:57,540 --> 10:52:58,740
Without some help.

40324
10:52:58,820 --> 10:52:59,520
Any place.

40325
10:52:59,520 --> 10:53:00,140
Would do.

40326
10:53:00,140 --> 10:53:00,900
Of about three

40327
10:53:00,900 --> 10:53:02,060
or 400 a year.

40328
10:53:02,060 --> 10:53:02,480
But to have.

40329
10:53:02,480 --> 10:53:03,380
I do not speak to Mr.

40330
10:53:03,380 --> 10:53:04,380
Darcy about it,

40331
10:53:04,380 --> 10:53:04,760
if you would

40332
10:53:04,760 --> 10:53:06,200
rather not yours,

40333
10:53:06,200 --> 10:53:07,400
etc..

40334
10:53:07,820 --> 10:53:08,720
As it happened

40335
10:53:08,720 --> 10:53:09,920
that Elizabeth had much.

40336
10:53:09,920 --> 10:53:10,800
Rather not.

40337
10:53:10,800 --> 10:53:11,460
She endeavored.

40338
10:53:11,460 --> 10:53:11,700
In her

40339
10:53:11,700 --> 10:53:12,740
answer to put an end

40340
10:53:12,740 --> 10:53:13,700
to every entreaty

40341
10:53:13,700 --> 10:53:14,780
and expectation of the.

40342
10:53:14,780 --> 10:53:15,740
Kind.

40343
10:53:15,740 --> 10:53:16,520
Such relief,

40344
10:53:16,520 --> 10:53:17,460
however as it was

40345
10:53:17,460 --> 10:53:18,660
in her power to afford

40346
10:53:18,800 --> 10:53:19,880
by the practice of what

40347
10:53:19,880 --> 10:53:21,120
might be called economy

40348
10:53:21,120 --> 10:53:21,540
in her own

40349
10:53:21,540 --> 10:53:22,740
private expenses,

40350
10:53:22,820 --> 10:53:23,540
she frequently

40351
10:53:23,540 --> 10:53:24,500
sent them.

40352
10:53:24,500 --> 10:53:25,320
It had always

40353
10:53:25,320 --> 10:53:26,520
been evident to her

40354
10:53:26,520 --> 10:53:27,540
that such an income

40355
10:53:27,540 --> 10:53:28,340
as theirs,

40356
10:53:28,340 --> 10:53:29,400
under the direction of

40357
10:53:29,400 --> 10:53:30,140
two persons

40358
10:53:30,140 --> 10:53:31,080
so extravagant

40359
10:53:31,080 --> 10:53:31,920
in their wants

40360
10:53:31,920 --> 10:53:32,700
and heedless of

40361
10:53:32,700 --> 10:53:33,600
the future,

40362
10:53:33,600 --> 10:53:34,020
must be

40363
10:53:34,020 --> 10:53:35,100
very insufficient

40364
10:53:35,100 --> 10:53:36,300
to their support.

40365
10:53:36,380 --> 10:53:36,960
And whenever

40366
10:53:36,960 --> 10:53:37,520
they change

40367
10:53:37,520 --> 10:53:38,400
their quarters.

40368
10:53:38,400 --> 10:53:39,920
Either Jane or herself

40369
10:53:39,920 --> 10:53:40,500
were sure of

40370
10:53:40,500 --> 10:53:41,460
being applied to

40371
10:53:41,460 --> 10:53:41,880
for some

40372
10:53:41,880 --> 10:53:42,740
little assistance

40373
10:53:42,740 --> 10:53:43,880
towards discharging

40374
10:53:43,880 --> 10:53:45,080
their bills.

40375
10:53:45,120 --> 10:53:46,280
Their manner of living,

40376
10:53:46,280 --> 10:53:47,580
even the restoration

40377
10:53:47,580 --> 10:53:48,060
of peace

40378
10:53:48,060 --> 10:53:49,020
dismissed them to a.

40379
10:53:49,020 --> 10:53:50,520
Home was unsettled

40380
10:53:50,520 --> 10:53:51,720
in the extreme.

40381
10:53:51,800 --> 10:53:52,100
They were.

40382
10:53:52,100 --> 10:53:53,400
Always moving from place

40383
10:53:53,400 --> 10:53:54,000
to place in

40384
10:53:54,000 --> 10:53:54,540
quest of a

40385
10:53:54,540 --> 10:53:55,740
cheap situation

40386
10:53:55,800 --> 10:53:56,840
and always

40387
10:53:56,840 --> 10:53:57,500
more than they.

40388
10:53:57,500 --> 10:53:58,380
Ought.

40389
10:53:58,380 --> 10:53:59,120
His affection

40390
10:53:59,120 --> 10:53:59,840
for her soon

40391
10:53:59,840 --> 10:54:01,100
sunk into indifference.

40392
10:54:01,320 --> 10:54:02,280
Hers lasted

40393
10:54:02,280 --> 10:54:03,360
a little longer,

40394
10:54:03,360 --> 10:54:04,160
and in spite of her

40395
10:54:04,160 --> 10:54:05,360
youth and her manners,

40396
10:54:05,520 --> 10:54:06,480
she retained

40397
10:54:06,480 --> 10:54:08,000
the claims to reputation

40398
10:54:08,220 --> 10:54:09,320
which her marriage had

40399
10:54:09,320 --> 10:54:09,860
given her.

40400
10:54:10,860 --> 10:54:11,540
Though Darcy

40401
10:54:11,540 --> 10:54:12,780
could never receive him

40402
10:54:12,780 --> 10:54:14,220
at Pemberley, yet,

40403
10:54:14,220 --> 10:54:15,360
for Elizabeth's sake,

40404
10:54:15,360 --> 10:54:16,040
he assisted him

40405
10:54:16,040 --> 10:54:16,620
further in

40406
10:54:16,620 --> 10:54:17,820
his profession.

40407
10:54:17,880 --> 10:54:19,200
Lydia was occasionally

40408
10:54:19,200 --> 10:54:20,120
a visitor there

40409
10:54:20,120 --> 10:54:20,960
when her husband

40410
10:54:20,960 --> 10:54:21,380
was gone

40411
10:54:21,380 --> 10:54:22,260
to enjoy himself

40412
10:54:22,260 --> 10:54:23,460
in London or Bath.

40413
10:54:23,760 --> 10:54:23,960
And.

40414
10:54:23,960 --> 10:54:24,680
With the Bingley,

40415
10:54:24,680 --> 10:54:25,440
say both of them

40416
10:54:25,440 --> 10:54:25,980
frequently

40417
10:54:25,980 --> 10:54:27,140
stayed so long.

40418
10:54:27,140 --> 10:54:27,720
That even.

40419
10:54:27,720 --> 10:54:28,220
Bingley

40420
10:54:28,220 --> 10:54:29,540
good humor was overcome.

40421
10:54:29,760 --> 10:54:31,140
And he proceeded so far

40422
10:54:31,140 --> 10:54:31,740
as to talk

40423
10:54:31,740 --> 10:54:32,300
of giving them

40424
10:54:32,300 --> 10:54:33,500
a hint to be gone.

40425
10:54:34,260 --> 10:54:35,000
Miss Bingley

40426
10:54:35,000 --> 10:54:35,460
was very

40427
10:54:35,460 --> 10:54:36,680
deeply mortified

40428
10:54:36,680 --> 10:54:37,880
by Darcy's marriage.

40429
10:54:38,160 --> 10:54:39,000
But as she thought.

40430
10:54:39,000 --> 10:54:39,660
It advisable

40431
10:54:39,660 --> 10:54:40,160
to retain

40432
10:54:40,160 --> 10:54:40,580
the right of

40433
10:54:40,580 --> 10:54:41,780
visiting at Pemberley,

40434
10:54:41,880 --> 10:54:43,020
she dropped all her

40435
10:54:43,020 --> 10:54:44,760
resentment was fonder

40436
10:54:44,760 --> 10:54:46,020
than ever of Georgiana

40437
10:54:46,280 --> 10:54:47,340
almost as attentive

40438
10:54:47,340 --> 10:54:48,660
to Darcy as heretofore,

40439
10:54:48,900 --> 10:54:49,680
and paid off

40440
10:54:49,680 --> 10:54:51,140
every area of civility

40441
10:54:51,140 --> 10:54:52,340
to Elizabeth.

40442
10:54:53,000 --> 10:54:53,580
Pemberley

40443
10:54:53,580 --> 10:54:54,420
was now Georgie

40444
10:54:54,420 --> 10:54:55,620
on his home and.

40445
10:54:55,620 --> 10:54:56,280
The attachment

40446
10:54:56,280 --> 10:54:56,900
of the sisters

40447
10:54:56,900 --> 10:54:58,140
was exactly what Darcy

40448
10:54:58,140 --> 10:54:59,340
had hoped to see.

40449
10:54:59,540 --> 10:55:00,320
They were able to

40450
10:55:00,320 --> 10:55:01,020
love each other

40451
10:55:01,020 --> 10:55:01,860
even as well as

40452
10:55:01,860 --> 10:55:03,060
they intended.

40453
10:55:03,080 --> 10:55:04,020
Georgiana had

40454
10:55:04,020 --> 10:55:04,860
the highest opinion

40455
10:55:04,860 --> 10:55:05,000
in the

40456
10:55:05,000 --> 10:55:06,200
world of Elizabeth,

40457
10:55:06,320 --> 10:55:07,200
though at first

40458
10:55:07,200 --> 10:55:08,040
she often listened

40459
10:55:08,040 --> 10:55:08,940
with an astonishment

40460
10:55:08,940 --> 10:55:10,140
bordering on alarm

40461
10:55:10,160 --> 10:55:11,660
at her lively sportive

40462
10:55:11,660 --> 10:55:12,440
manner of talking

40463
10:55:12,440 --> 10:55:13,640
to her brother.

40464
10:55:13,740 --> 10:55:14,700
He, who had always

40465
10:55:14,700 --> 10:55:15,800
inspired herself

40466
10:55:15,800 --> 10:55:16,320
a respect

40467
10:55:16,320 --> 10:55:17,400
which almost overcame

40468
10:55:17,400 --> 10:55:18,420
her affection.

40469
10:55:18,420 --> 10:55:20,040
She now saw the object

40470
10:55:20,040 --> 10:55:21,360
of open pleasantry.

40471
10:55:21,800 --> 10:55:22,380
Her mind

40472
10:55:22,380 --> 10:55:23,280
received knowledge

40473
10:55:23,280 --> 10:55:24,240
which had never before

40474
10:55:24,240 --> 10:55:25,440
fallen in her way

40475
10:55:25,760 --> 10:55:26,480
by Elizabeth's

40476
10:55:26,480 --> 10:55:27,480
instructions.

40477
10:55:27,480 --> 10:55:28,020
She began

40478
10:55:28,020 --> 10:55:28,760
to comprehend

40479
10:55:28,760 --> 10:55:29,300
that a woman

40480
10:55:29,300 --> 10:55:30,380
may take liberties

40481
10:55:30,380 --> 10:55:31,140
with her husband,

40482
10:55:31,140 --> 10:55:31,640
which a brother

40483
10:55:31,640 --> 10:55:32,840
will not always allow

40484
10:55:32,960 --> 10:55:33,620
in a sister

40485
10:55:33,620 --> 10:55:34,260
more than ten

40486
10:55:34,260 --> 10:55:34,980
years younger

40487
10:55:34,980 --> 10:55:35,720
than himself.

40488
10:55:36,720 --> 10:55:37,740
Lady Catherine was

40489
10:55:37,740 --> 10:55:39,080
extremely indignant

40490
10:55:39,080 --> 10:55:39,680
on the marriage

40491
10:55:39,680 --> 10:55:40,640
of her nephew,

40492
10:55:40,640 --> 10:55:41,420
and as she gave

40493
10:55:41,420 --> 10:55:42,620
way to all the genuine

40494
10:55:42,620 --> 10:55:43,160
frankness

40495
10:55:43,160 --> 10:55:44,180
of her character

40496
10:55:44,180 --> 10:55:45,000
in her reply

40497
10:55:45,000 --> 10:55:45,540
to the letter

40498
10:55:45,540 --> 10:55:46,100
which announced

40499
10:55:46,100 --> 10:55:47,180
its arrangement,

40500
10:55:47,180 --> 10:55:48,320
she sent him language

40501
10:55:48,320 --> 10:55:49,580
so very abusive,

40502
10:55:49,760 --> 10:55:51,080
especially of Elizabeth,

40503
10:55:51,380 --> 10:55:52,500
that for some time

40504
10:55:52,500 --> 10:55:53,360
all intercourse

40505
10:55:53,360 --> 10:55:54,560
was at an end.

40506
10:55:54,620 --> 10:55:55,460
But at length.

40507
10:55:55,460 --> 10:55:56,220
By Elizabeth's

40508
10:55:56,220 --> 10:55:57,120
persuasion,

40509
10:55:57,120 --> 10:55:58,140
he was prevailed on

40510
10:55:58,140 --> 10:55:59,400
to overlook the offense

40511
10:55:59,600 --> 10:56:00,140
and seek

40512
10:56:00,140 --> 10:56:01,340
her reconciliation.

40513
10:56:01,560 --> 10:56:02,480
And after a little

40514
10:56:02,480 --> 10:56:03,360
further resistance

40515
10:56:03,360 --> 10:56:04,560
on the part of his aunt,

40516
10:56:04,640 --> 10:56:05,460
her resentment

40517
10:56:05,460 --> 10:56:06,780
gave way either

40518
10:56:06,780 --> 10:56:07,980
to her affection for him

40519
10:56:08,220 --> 10:56:09,260
or her curiosity

40520
10:56:09,260 --> 10:56:10,200
to see how his wife

40521
10:56:10,200 --> 10:56:11,400
conducted herself.

40522
10:56:11,480 --> 10:56:11,900
And she.

40523
10:56:11,900 --> 10:56:13,220
Condescended to wait

40524
10:56:13,220 --> 10:56:14,420
on them at Pemberley

40525
10:56:14,420 --> 10:56:15,140
in spite of

40526
10:56:15,140 --> 10:56:16,020
that pollution.

40527
10:56:16,020 --> 10:56:16,760
Which its woods

40528
10:56:16,760 --> 10:56:17,660
had received,

40529
10:56:17,660 --> 10:56:18,320
not merely.

40530
10:56:18,320 --> 10:56:19,040
From the presence

40531
10:56:19,040 --> 10:56:20,240
of such a mistress.

40532
10:56:20,240 --> 10:56:21,020
But the visits.

40533
10:56:21,020 --> 10:56:21,840
Of her uncle and.

40534
10:56:21,840 --> 10:56:23,100
Aunt from the city

40535
10:56:24,080 --> 10:56:24,360
with.

40536
10:56:24,360 --> 10:56:25,160
The gardeners,

40537
10:56:25,160 --> 10:56:25,500
they were

40538
10:56:25,500 --> 10:56:26,040
